United States Supreme Court v. The Court of Public OPINION
----------------------------------------------------------

My capstone project for The Data Incubator relates opinions
and decisions of the United States Supreme Court to the
opinions and feelings of the United States public.

A user defined set of keywords represents a particular concept
or issue. For instance, the set of keywords
{'gay', 'lesbian', 'homosexual', 'sodomy', 'marriage', 'homo',
'LGBT'} could be used to focus on the issue of gay marriage.

For a given set of keywords, both a relevant set of supreme court
cases and public opinion questions are chosen.

The case data (along with individual justice data) is publicly
available online at the Washington University of Law website.
The cases cover 1946 - 2016. The case descriptions and opinions
are scraped and a sentiment analysis is performed using the
given keywords. For gay marriage, there are approximately 14
relevant cases.

The public opinion data are sourced from ANES, the American
National Election Studies. These are publicly available online.
The data are questions posed to a representative sample of
voters every two years before elections and cover 1948-2016.
An example question for 'Gay Marriage' is

Q: "Gay men and lesbians (that is), homosexuals -- thermometer"
Output: 0-96

By taking a weighted average over relevant questions, we can form
a metric to measure whether the public supports gay marriage.

Looking at the proportion of pro-'Gay Marriage' votes, we obtain
a metric which measures to what degree the Supreme Court is deciding
in favor of 'Gay Marriage'.

My website displays a plot of both metrics, linear regressions for each
set of data, relevant statistics, and the set of relevant cases to the
left and relevant public opinion questions to the right.
