United States Supreme Court v. The Court of Public OPINION
----------------------------------------------------------

My capstone project for The Data Incubator relates opinions
and decisions of the United States Supreme Court to the
opinions and feelings of the United States public.

A user defined set of keywords represents a particular concept
or issue. For instance, the set of keywords
{'gay', 'lesbian', 'homosexual', 'sodomy', 'marriage', 'homo',
'LGBT'} could be used to focus on the issue of gay marriage.

For a given set of keywords, both a relevant set of supreme court
cases and public opinion questions are chosen.

The case data (along with individual justice data) is publicly
available online at the Washington University of Law website.
The cases cover 1946 - 2016. The case descriptions and opinions
are scraped and a sentiment analysis is performed using the
given keywords. For gay marriage, there are approximately 14
relevant cases.
