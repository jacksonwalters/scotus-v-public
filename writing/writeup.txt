US SUPREME COURT v. COURT OF PUBLIC OPINION

#####################################################################################

#KEY PROBLEM: linking appropriate PO data with corresponding SC cases.
#SOLUTION: for a given Issue (semantic issue is more general/colloquial than
#issueArea/issue given in db) we associate a set of relevant Cases from SCDB,
#and a set of relevant Questions from PODB.
#typically, there will only be a handful (10-20) of cases. we slice the SCDB to
#keep track of time, Yes/No vote ratio, and the decision result (yes equiv. to
#Yes/No > 1).
#for PO, data is phrased in terms of Questions, e.g. "Do you support gay
#marriage?". Sometimes these have Yes/No answers, sometimes they don't.
#regardless, each row of PO data needs to be crushed down to a meta-data value
#in [0,1] representing to what degree the public 'supports' a Yes vote on the
#given issue. get this value by taking (weighted) average of normalized
#response.


TWO SIDES TO EACH ISSUE:
	- 'PRO' and 'ANTI', nuance is difficult. SC data has 'decisionDirection' for liberal
	or conservative.

ARBITRARINESS: 
	- choosing an issue such as 'Gay Marriage'. This comes from set of keywords.
	- relevant cases come from looking at opinions/plain text descriptions of cases
	and doing keyword matching.
	- which public opinion questions are relevant? keyword matching in list of PO questions
	- weighting public opinion questions: directly relevant questions weighted higher, 
	e.g. "Do you support same-sex marriage?" vs. "Do you support gays in the military?, 
	however how do we assign weights?
	
LIMITED DATA: 
	- for a given issue, only a handful (10-20) of Supreme Court cases
	
WHAT EXACTLY ARE WE ASKING:
	- data may be uncorrelated, positively, or negatively correlated.	
	- Q1: after analyzing many (~1000) issues, which cases are out of the ordinary? in the
	sense that data is negatively correlated, i.e. SC *disagrees* with PO.
	- Q2: 

THINGS TO KEEP IN MIND/CONSIDER: 
	- for a given case, it should be clear which side is 'PRO' and which is 'ANTI'.
	
WHO CARES?:
	- use this data to make predictions. given an issue which is not yet 'fully' decided
	can use linear regression, etc. to try to predict future decisions.
	
ENDGAME:
	- create web interface for user to input keywords/issues. result is comparision plot
	of supreme court and public opinion.
