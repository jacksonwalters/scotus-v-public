Capstone Project for TDI

Name: Jackson Walters
Project Title: US Supreme Court v. Court of Public Opinion

Concept: Relates opinions and decisions of SC to opinion of US public at large.

Implementation:

- Uses publicly available data from SCDB and ANES.
- Input: Set of keywords to specify issue, e.g. LGBTQ rights.
- App uses NLP tools (tfidf) to identify relevant cases and PO questions.
- Sentiment analysis to decide polarity of judicial vote and public
responses (pro or anti), e.g. a vote in favor of the plaintiff Obergefell
would be considered pro LGBTQ rights as would a response of 'Yes' to the
question "Do you support gays in the military?".
- After normalizing to a scale of [-1,1] and averaging, we obtain a metric
for measuring SC support and public support on an issue.

Product: These two bodies are indirectly connected via the public's
elected president who appoints justices, and their elected representatives in the
senate who vote on confirmation. We expect that their views on issues be correlated.
This app provides insight into the direction support for an issue is trending towards.
By modeling the data we can predict when a paradigm shift might occur, e.g. public
paradigm shift on gay rights seems to have occurred in 1996 and within a year
supreme court decisions were being decided in favor as well. If it is determined
that the supreme court has shifted before the public, this could be used to
inform political campaigns.
