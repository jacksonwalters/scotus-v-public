<center><h1>The STATE of GEORGIA<br/>
versus<br/>
BRAISLFORD, et al.</h1></center>
<center><p><b>Supreme Court of United States.</b></p></center>
<center></center>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*405</span> The motion was opposed by Randolph, for the defendants.</p>
<p>JOHNSON, Justice.</p>
<p>In order to support a motion for an injunction, the bill should set forth a case of probable right, and a probable danger that the right would be defeated, without this special interposition of the court. It does not appear to me, that the present bill sufficiently claims such an interposition. If the State has a right to the debt in question, it may be enforced at common law, notwithstanding the judgment of the Circuit court; and there is no suggestion in the bill, though it has been suggested at the bar, that the State is likely to lose her right by the insolvency either of Spalding, the original debtor, or of Brailsford, who will become her debtor for the amount, if he receives it, when in law he ought not to receive, or retain, it.</p>
<p>Nor does the bill state any particular confederacy, or fraud. The refusal to admit the Attorney General as a party on the record, was the act of a competent court; and it is not sufficient barely to alledge, that the defendant has not chosen to sue out a writ of error.</p>
<p>The case might, perhaps, be made better; but as I can only know, at present, the facts which the bill alledges, and which the affidavit supports, it is my opinion, that there is not a proper foundation for issuing an injunction.</p>
<p>IREDELL, Justice.</p>
<p>I sat in the Circuit court, when the judgment was rendered in the case of Brailsford and others versus <span class="star-pagination">*406</span> Spalding; but I shall give my opinion, on the present motion, detached from every previous consideration of the merits of the cause.</p>
<p>The debt claimed by the plaintiffs below, was, likewise, claimed by the State of Georgia. The State applied to be admitted to assert her claim, but the application was rejected; nor has any writ of error been instituted upon the judgment. These facts, however, are only mentioned to introduce this remark, that the Circuit court could not, with propriety, sustain the application of Georgia; because, whenever a State is a party, the Supreme court has exclusive jurisdiction of the suit; and her right cannot be effectually supported, by a voluntary appearance, before any other tribunal of the Union. Not being a party, nor capable of resorting as a party, to the Circuit court, it is very much to be questioned whether the State could bring a writ of error on the judgment there, even if her claim appeared on the record.</p>
<p>Every principle of law, justice, and honor, however, seem to require, that the claim of the State of Georgia should not be, indirectly, decided, or defeated, by a judgment pronounced between parties, over whom she had no controul, and upon a trial, in which she was not allowed to be heard. If, indeed, the court could not devise a mode, for admitting a fair investigation and determination upon that claim, it would be useless to grant an injunction: But I think a mode may easily be prescribed, in strict conformity with the practice and principles of equity.</p>
<p>It was in the power of the defendant in the Circuit court, to have filed a bill of interpleader, in order, for his own safety, to settle the rights of the contending parties; but neither in that form, nor by instituting a suit herself, could Georgia have derived the benefit of supporting her claim in her own way, before any other than the Supreme court. In this court, therefore, we ought now to place the State upon the same footing, as if a bill of interpleader had been regularly filed here; which can be done by sustaining the present suit; and when the parties are all before us, we may direct a proper issue to be formed, and tried at the bar. Thus, justice will be done to Georgia, and an irreparable injury may be prevented; while the adverse party, even if he ultimately succeeds, can only complain of a short delay.</p>
<p>With this view, I think, that an injunction should be awarded to stay the money in the hands of the marshall, till this court shall make a further order on the subject.</p>
<p>BLAIR, Justice.</p>
<p>The State of Georgia seems to have done all that she could to obtain a hearing. An application was made to the Circuit court, in the nature of a claim to interplead; but being refused, her alternative, under all the circumstances of the case, is an appeal to the equitable jurisdiction of the Supreme <span class="star-pagination">*407</span> court. It is true, perhaps, as the counsel has suggested, that the defendant below pleaded the confiscation act of Georgia in bar to the action; but it is a sufficient answer to this argument, that the State was not a party; and no right can be defeated, in law, unless the party claiming it, has himself an opportunity to support it.</p>
<p>If the State of Georgia was entitled to the bond, she is equally entitled to the money levied by the marshall in satisfaction of the bond, or rather of the judgment rendered upon it: And as the execution directs the marshall to pay the amount to the plaintiffs below, I can perceive no other mode of preventing a compliance, while we enquire into the right of receiving the money, than that of issuing an injunction to stay it in the hands of the officer.</p>
<p>It appears to me to be too early, likewise, to pronounce an opinion upon the titles in collision; since it is enough, on a motion of this kind, to shew a colorable title. The State of Georgia has set up her confiscation act, which certainly is a fair foundation for future judicial investigation; and that an injury may not be done, which it may be out of our power to repair, the injunction ought, I think, to issue, till we are enabled, by a full enquiry, to decide upon the whole merits of the case.</p>
<p>WILSON, Justice.</p>
<p>I confess, that I have not been able to form an opinion which is perfectly satisfactory to my own mind, upon the points that have been discussed. If Georgia has a right to the bond, it is strictly a legal right; but to enforce a strictly legal right, the present seems, at the first blush, to be an awkward and irregular proceeding. Again: Georgia had not a right, or she had a right, to be admitted to a hearing in the Circuit court: but, in the former case, it would be no ground of complaint, that her application was rejected; for, she is bound by the law; and in the other case, she would be entitled to bring the subject before us, as a court of law; since she was refused the exercise of a legal right.</p>
<p>It is true, that, under the Federal Constitution, an inferior tribunal cannot compel a State to appear as a party; but it is a very different proposition to say, that a State cannot, by her own consent, appear in any other court, than the Supreme court. The general rule applies among all sovereigns, who, as equals, are not amenable to courts of each other; and yet I remember an action was instituted and sustained, some years ago, in the name of Louis XVI. king of France, against Mr. Robert Morris, in the Supreme court of Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Under these impressions, I am disposed to think, that the State of Georgia ought rather to have sued out a writ of error, than to have asked for an injunction: But still, in the existing <span class="star-pagination">*408</span> circumstances of the case, I have no objection to retain the money within the power of the court, 'till we can better satisfy ourselves both as to the remedy and the right.</p>
<p>CUSHING, Justice.</p>
<p>The Judicial act expressly declares, that "suits in equity shall not be sustained, in either of the courts of the United States, in any case where plain, adequate, and complete remedy may be had at law." Now, if Georgia has any right to the debt in question, it is a right at law, for which, of course, the law will furnish a plain, adequate, and complete remedy. The decision of the Circuit court, in a case to which Georgia was neither party nor privy, did not, and could not, take away either the right or the remedy of the State. Nor can Spalding, the defendant below, be made liable twice, for the same debt, without his wilful laches. For, it is in his power to bring a writ of error; and then the whole merits of the claim of Georgia appearing on the record, we must decide it as a question of law, either by affirming or reversing the judgment, so as to bind us in any suit, which Georgia might institute for the same cause.</p>
<p>Besides, the State of Georgia (notwithstanding the judgment of the Circuit court) may bring an action of indebitatus assumpsit against Brailsford (who is a man of fortune), after they have received the money, upon the principle of Moses versus M'Farland, and with stronger reason; as in that case the parties, in both courts, were the same; but, in the case proposed, they would be different, and one of them has never been heard. In some form, therefore, Georgia may obtain compleat redress at law.</p>
<p>I do not, upon the whole, consider the refusal of Spalding to bring a writ of error (which he is not compellable to bring) nor any other suggestion in the bill, as a sufficient foundation for exercising the equitable jurisdiction of the court; and, consequently, I think that an injunction ought not to be awarded.</p>
<p>JAY, Chief Justice.</p>
<p>My first ideas were unfavorable to the motion; but many reasons have been urged, which operate forcibly to produce a change of opinion.</p>
<p>The great question turns on the property of a certain bond; Â— whether it belongs to Brailsford, or to Georgia? It is put in suit by Brailsford; but if Georgia, by virtue of the confiscation act, is really entitled to the debt, she is entitled to the money, though the evidence of the debt happened to be in the possession of Brailsford, and though Brailsford has, by that means, obtained a judgment for the amount.</p>
<p>Then the only point to be considered is Â— whether, under these circumstances, it is not equitable to stay the money in the <span class="star-pagination">*409</span> hands of the marshall, 'till the right to it is fairly decided; and so avoid the risque of putting the true owner to a suit, for the purpose of recovering it back?</p>
<p>For my part, I think that the money should remain in the custody of the law, till the law has adjudged to whom it belongs; and, therefore, I am content, that the injunction issue.</p>
<p>An Injunction granted.<sup>[*]</sup></p>

<center><h1>HAYBURN'S CASE.</h1></center>
<center><p><b>Supreme Court of United States.</b></p></center>
<center></center>
<p>The Attorney General (Randolph) who made the motion for the mandamus, having premised that it was done ex officio, without an application from any particular person, but with a view to procure the execution of an act of Congress, particularly interesting to a meritorious and unfortunate class of citizens, THE COURT declared that they entertained great doubt upon his right, under such circumstances, and in a case of this kind, to proceed ex officio; and directed him to state the principles on which he attempted to support the right. The Attorney General, accordingly, entered into an elaborate description of the powers and duties of his office: Â—</p>
<p>But THE COURT being divided in opinion on that question, the motion, made ex officio, was not allowed.</p>
<p>The Attorney General then changed the ground of his interposition, declaring it to be at the instance, and on behalf of Hayburn, a party interested; and he entered into the merits of the case, upon the act of Congress, and the refusal of the Judges to carry it into effect.</p>
<p>THE COURT observed, that they would hold the motion under advisement, until the next term; but no decision was ever pronounced, as the Legislature, at an an intermediate <span class="star-pagination">*410</span> session, provided, in another way, for the relief of the pensioners.<sup>[Â†]</sup></p>
<h2>NOTES</h2>
<p>[Â†]  See an act passed the 28th Feb. 1793. Â— As the reasons assigned by the Judges, for declining to execute the first act of Congress, involve a great Constitutional question, it will not be thought improper to subjoin them, in illustration of Hayburn's case. The Circuit court for the district of New York (consisting of JAY, Chief Justice, CUSHING, Justice, and DUANE, District Judge) proceeded on the 5th of April, 1791, to take into consideration the act of Congress entitled "An act to provide for the settlement of the claims "of widows and orphans barred by the limitations heretofore established, "and to regulate the claims to invalid pensions;" and were, thereupon, unanimously, of opinion and agreed.
</p>
<p>"That by the Constitution of the United States, the government thereof is divided into three distinct and independent branches, and that it is the duty of each to abstain from, and to oppose, encroachments on either.</p>
<p>"That neither the Legislative nor the Executive branches, can constitutionally assign to the Judicial any duties, but such as are properly judicial, and to be performed in a judicial manner.</p>
<p>"That the duties assigned to the Circuit courts, by this act, are not of that description, and that the act itself does not appear to contemplate them as such; in as much as it subjects the decisions of these courts, made pursuant to those duties, first to the consideration and suspension of the Secretary at War, and then to the revision of the Legislature; whereas by the Constitution, neither the Secretary at War, nor any other Executive officer, nor even the Legislature, are authorized to sit as a court of errors on the judicial acts or opinions of this court.</p>
<p>"As, therefore, the business assigned to this court, by the act, is not judicial, nor directed to be performed judicially, the act can only be considered as appointing commissioners for the purposes mentioned in it, by official instead of personal descriptions.</p>
<p>"That the Judges of this court regard themselves as being the commissioners designated by the act, and therefore as being at liberty to accept or decline that office.</p>
<p>"That as the objects of this act are exceedingly benevolent, and do real honor to the humanity and justice of Congress; and as the Judges desire to manifest, on all proper occasions, and in every proper manner, their high respect for the National Legislature, they will execute this act in the capacity of commissioners.</p>
<p>"That as the Legislature have a right to extend the session of this court for any term, which they may think proper by law to assign, the term of five days, as directed by this act, ought to be punctually observed.</p>
<p>"That the Judges of this court will, as usual, during the session thereof, adjourn the court from day to day, or other short periods, as circumstances may render proper, and that they will, regularly, between the adjournments, proceed as commissioners to execute the business of this act in the same court room, or chamber."</p>
<p>The Circuit court for the district of Pennsylvania, (consisting of WILSON, and BLAIR, Justices, and PETERS, District Judge) made the following representation, in a letter jointly addressed to the President of the United States, on the 18th of April, 1792.</p>
<p>"To you it officially belongs to "take care that the laws" of the United States "be faithfully executed." Before you, therefore, we think it our duty to lay the sentiments, which, on a late painful occasion, governed us with regard to an act passed by the legislature of the union.</p>
<p>"The people of the United States have vested in Congress all legislative powers "granted in the constitution."</p>
<p>"They have vested in one Supreme court, and in such inferior courts as the Congress shall establish, "the judicial power of the United States."</p>
<p>"It is worthy of remark, that in Congress the whole legislative power of the United States is not vested. An important part of that power was exercised by the people themselves, when they "ordained and established the Constitution."</p>
<p>"This Constitution is "the Supreme Law of the Land." This supreme law "all judicial officers of the United States are bound, by oath or affirmation, to support."</p>
<p>"It is a principle important to freedom, that in government, the judicial should be distinct from, and independent of, the legislative department. To this important principle the people of the United States, in forming their Constitution, have manifested the highest regard.</p>
<p>"They have placed their judicial power not in Congress, but in "courts." They have ordained that the "Judges of those courts shall hold their offices during good behaviour," and that "during their continuance in office, their salaries shall not be diminished."</p>
<p>"Congress have lately passed an act, to regulate, among other things, "the claims to invalid pensions."</p>
<p>"Upon due consideration, we have been unanimously of opinion, that, under this act, the Circuit court held for the Pennsylvania district could not proceed;</p>
<p>"1st. Because the business directed by this act is not of a judicial nature. It forms no part of the power vested by the Constitution in the courts of the United States; the Circuit court must, consequently, have proceeded without constitutional authority.</p>
<p>"2d. Because, if, upon that business, the court had proceeded, its judgments (for its opinions are its judgments) might, under the same act, have been revised and controuled by the legislature, and by an officer in the executive department. Such revision and controul we deemed radically inconsistent with the independence of that judicial power which is vested in the courts; and, consequently, with that important principle which is so strictly observed by the Constitution of the United States.</p>
<p>"These, Sir, are the reasons of our conduct. Be assured that, though it became necessary, it was far from being pleasant. To be obliged to act contrary, either to the obvious directions of Congress, or to a constitutional principle, in our judgment equally obvious, excited feelings in us, which we hope never to experience again."</p>
<p>The Circuit court for the district of North Carolina, (consisting of IREDELL, Justice, and SITGREAVES, District Judge) made the following representation in a letter jointly addressed to the President of the United States, on the 8th of June, 1792.</p>
<p>"We, the judges now attending at the Circuit court of the United States for the district of North Carolina, conceive it our duty to lay before you some important observations which have occurred to us in the consideration of an act of Congress lately passed, entitled "an act to provide for the settlement of the claims of widows and orphans barred by the limitations heretofore established, and to regulate the claims to invalid pensions.</p>
<p>"We beg leave to premise, that it is as much our inclination, as it is our duty, to receive with all possible respect every act of the Legislature, and that we never can find ourselves in a more painful situation than to be obliged to object to the execution of any, more especially to the execution of one sounded on the purest principles of humanity and justice, which the act in question undoubtedly is. But, however lamentable a difference in opinion really may be, or with whatever difficulty we may have formed an opinion, we are under the indispensable necessity of acting according to the best dictates of our own judgment, after duly weighing every consideration that can occur to us; which we have done on the present occasion.</p>
<p>"The extreme importance of the case, and our desire of being explicit beyond the danger of being misunderstood, will, we hope, justify us in flating our observations in a systematic manner. We therefore, Sir, submit to you the following: Â—</p>
<p>"1. That the Legislative, Executive, and Judicial departments, are each formed in a separate and independent manner; and that the ultimate basis of each is the Constitution only, within the limits of which each department can alone justify any act of authority.</p>
<p>"2. That the Legislature, among other important powers, unquestionably possess that of establishing courts in such a manner as to their wisdom shall appear best, limited by the terms of the constitution only; and to whatever extent that power may be exercised, or however severe the duty they may think proper to require, the Judges, when appointed in virtue of any such establishment, owe implicit and unreserved obedience to it.</p>
<p>"3. That at the same time such courts cannot be warranted, as we conceive, by virtue of that part of the Constitution delegating Judicial power, for the exercise of which any act of the legislature is provided, in exercising (even under the authority of another act) any power not in its nature judicial, or, if judicial, not provided for upon the terms the Constitution requires.</p>
<p>"4. That whatever doubt may be suggested, whether the power in question is properly of a judicial nature, yet inasmuch as the decision of the court is not made final, but may be at least suspended in its operation by the Secretary at War, if he shall have cause to suspect imposition or mistake; this subjects the decision of the court to a mode of revision which we consider to be unwarranted by the Constitution; for, though Congress may certainly establish, in instances not yet provided for, courts of appellate jurisdiction, yet such courts must consist of judges appointed in the manner the Constitution requires, and holding their offices by no other tenure than that of their good behaviour, by which tenure the office of Secretary at War is not held. And we beg leave to add, with all due deference, that no decision of any court of the United States can, under any circumstances, in our opinion, agreeable to the Constitution, be liable to a reversion, or even suspension, by the Legislature itself, in whom no judicial power of any kind appears to be vested, but the important one relative to impeachments.</p>
<p>"These, sir, are our reasons for being of opinion, as we are at present, that this Circuit court cannot be justified in the execution of that part of the act, which requires it to examine and report an opinion on the unfortunate cases of officers and soldiers disabled in the service of the United States. The part of the act requiring the court to sit five days, for the purpose of receiving applications from such persons, we shall deem it our duty to comply with; for, whether in our opinion such purpose can or cannot be answered, it is, as we conceive, our indispensable duty to keep open any court of which we have the honor to be judges, as long as Congress shall direct.</p>
<p>"The high respect we entertain for the Legislature, our feelings as men for persons, whose situation requires the earliest, as well as the most effectual relief, and our sincere desire to promote, whether officially or otherwise, the just and benevolent views of Congress, so conspicuous on the present as well as on many other occasions, have induced us to reflect, whether we could be justified in acting, under this act, personally in the character of commissioners during the session of a court; and could we be satisfied that we had authority to do so, we would cheerfully devote such part of our time as might be necessary for the performance of the service. But we confess we have great doubts on this head. The power appears to be given to the court only, and not to the Judges of it; and as the Secretary at War has not a discretion in all instances, but only in those where he has cause to suspect imposition or mistake, to with-hold a person recommended by the court from being named on the pension list, it would be necessary for us to be well persuaded we possessed such an authority, before we exercised a power, which might be a means of drawing money out of the public treasury as effectually as an express appropriation by law. We do not mean, however, to preclude ourselves from a very delibe rate consideration, whether we can be warranted in executing the purposes of the act in that manner, in case an application should be made.</p>
<p>"No application has yet been made to the court, or to ourselves individually, and therefore we have had some doubts as to the propriety of giving an opinion in a case which has not yet come regularly and judicially before us. None can be more sensible than we are of the necessity of judges being in general extremely cautious in not intimating an opinion in any case extra-judicially, because we well know how liable the best minds are, notwithstanding their utmost care, to a bias, which may arise from a pre-conceived opinion, even unguardedly, much more deliberately, given: But in the present instance, as many unfortunate and meritorious individuals, whom Congress have justly thought proper objects of immediate relief, may suffer great distress even by a short delay, and may be utterly ruined by a long one, we determined at all events to make our sentiments known as early as possible, considering this as a case which must be deemed an exception to the general rule, upon every principle of humanity and justice; resolving however, that so far as we are concerned individually, in case an application should be made, we will most attentively hear it; and if we can be convinced this opinion is a wrong one, we shall not hesitate to act accordingly, being as far from the weakness of supposing that there is any reproach in having committed an error, to which the greatest and best men are sometimes liable, as we should be from so low a sense of duty, as to think it would not be the highest and most deserved reproach that could be bestowed on any men (much more on Judges) that they were capable, from any motive, of persevering against conviction, in apparently maintaining an opinion, which they really thought to be erroneous."</p>

GEORGIA.</h1></center>
<center><p><b>Supreme Court of United States.</b></p></center>
<center></center>
<p>Upon which Mr. Randolph, the Attorney General of the United States, as counsel for the plaintiff.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*429</span> IREDELL, Justice.</p>
<p>This great cause comes before the Court, on a motion made by the Attorney-General, that an order be made by this Court to the following effect: Â— "That, unless "the State of Georgia shall, after reasonable notice of this motion, "cause an appearance to be entered on behalf of the "said State, on the fourth day of next Term, or shew cause to "the contrary, judgment shall be entered for the Plaintiff, and "a writ of enquiry shall be awarded." Before such an order be made, it is proper that this Court should be satisfied it hath cognizance of the suit; for, to be sure we ought not to enter a conditional judgment (which this would be) in a case where we were not fully persuaded we had authority to do so.</p>
<p>This is the first instance wherein the important question involved in this cause has come regularly before the Court. In the Maryland case it did not, because the Attorney-General of the State voluntarily appeared. We could not, therefore, without the greatest impropriety, have taken up the question suddenly. That case has since been compromised: But, had it proceeded to trial, and a verdict been given for the Plaintiff, it would have been our duty, previous to our giving judgment, to have well <span class="star-pagination">*430</span> considered whether we were warranted in giving it. I had then great doubts upon my mind, and should in such a case, have proposed a discussion of the subject. Those doubts have increased since, and, after the fullest consideration, I have been able to bestow on the subject, and the most respectful attention to the able argument of the Attorney-General, I am now decidedly of opinion that no such action as this before the Court can legally be maintained.</p>
<p>The action is an action of assumpsit. The particular question then before the Court, is, will an action of assumpsit lie against a State? This particular question (abstracted from the general one, viz. Whether, a State can in any instance be sued?) I took the liberty to propose to the consideration of the Attorney-General, last Term. I did so, because I have often found a great deal of confusion to arise from taking too large a view at once, and I had found myself embarrassed on this very subject, until I considered the abstract question itself. The Attorney-General has spoken to it, in deference to my request, as he has been pleased to intimate, but he spoke to this particular question slightly, conceiving it to be involved in the general one; and after establishing, as he thought, that point, he seemed to consider the other followed of course. He expressed, indeed, some doubt how to prove what appeared so plain. It seemed to him (if I recollect right) to depend principally on the solution of this simple question; can a State assume? But the Attorney-General must know, that in England, certain judicial proceedings not inconsistent with the sovereignty, may take place against the Crown, but that an action of assumpsit will not lie. Yet surely the King can assume as well as a State. So can the United States themselves, as well as any State in the Union: Yet, the Attorney-General himself has taken some pains to shew, that no action whatever is maintainable against the United States. I shall, therefore, confine myself, as much as possible, to the particular question before the Court, though every thing I have to say upon it will effect every kind of suit, the object of which is to compel the payment of money by a State.</p>
<p>The question, as I before observed, is, Â— will an action of assumpsit lie against a State? If it will, it must be in virtue of the Constitution of the United States, and of some law of Congress conformable thereto. The part of the Constitution concerning the Judicial Power, is as follows, viz: Art. 3. sect. 2. The Judicial Power shall extend, (1.) To all cases, in law and equity, arising under the Constitution, the laws of the United States, and treaties made, or which shall be made, under their authority. (2.) To all cases affecting Ambassadors, or other public Ministers, and Consuls; (3.) To all cases of Admiralty and Maritime Jurisdiction; (4.) To controversies to which the <span class="star-pagination">*431</span> United States shall be a party; (5.) To controversies between two or more States; between a State and citizens of another State; between citizens of different States; between citizens of the same State, claiming lands under grants of different States; and, between a State or the citizens thereof, and foreign States, citizens or subjects. The Constitution, therefore, provides for the jurisdiction wherein a State is a party, in the following instances: Â— 1st. Controversies between two or more States. 2d. Controversies between a State and citizens of another State. 3d. Controversies between a State, and foreign States, citizens, or subjects. And it also provides, that in all cases in which a State shall be a party, the Supreme Court shall have original jurisdiction.</p>
<p>The words of the general judicial act, conveying the authority of the Supreme Court, under the Constitution, so far as they concern this question, are as follow: Â— Sect. 13. "That the Supreme Court shall have exclusive jurisdiction of all controversies of a civil nature, where a State is a party, except between a State and its citizens; and except also, between a State and citizens of other States, or aliens, in which latter case it shall have original, but not exclusive jurisdiction. And shall have, exclusively, all jurisdiction of suits or proceedings against Ambassadors, or other public Ministers, or their domestics, or domestic servants, as a court of law can have or exercise consistently with the law of nations; and original, but not exclusive jurisdiction of all suits brought by Ambassadors, or other public Ministers, or in which a Consul, or Vice-Consul, shall be a party."</p>
<p>The Supreme Court hath, therefore, FIRST. Exclusive jurisdiction in every controversy of a civil nature: 1st. Between two or more States. 2d. Between a State and a foreign State. 3d. Where a suit or proceeding is depending against Ambassadors, other public ministers, or their domestics, or domestic servants. SECOND. Original, but not exclusive jurisdiction, 1st. between a State and citizens of other States. 2d. Between a State and foreign citizens or subjects. 3d. Where a suit is brought by Ambassadors, or other public ministers. 4th, Where a consul or vice-consul, is a party. The suit now before the Court (if maintainable at all) comes within the latter description, it being a suit against a State by a citizen of another State.</p>
<p>The Constitution is particular in expressing the parties who may be the objects of the jurisdiction in any of these cases, but in respect to the subject-matter upon which such jurisdiction is to be exercised, uses the word "controversies" only. The act of Congress more particularly mentions civil controversies, a qualification of the general word in the Constitution, which I do not doubt every reasonable man will think well warranted, for <span class="star-pagination">*432</span> it cannot be presumed that the general word "controversies" was intended to include any proceedings that relate to criminal cases, which in all instances that respect the same Government, only, are uniformly considered of a local nature, and to be decided by its particular laws. The word "controversy" indeed, would not naturally justify any such construction, but nevertheless it was perhaps a proper instance of caution in Congress to guard against the possibility of it.</p>
<p>A general question of great importance here occurs. What controversy of a civil nature can be maintained against a State by an individual? The framers of the Constitution, I presume, must have meant one of two things: Either 1. In the conveyance of that part of the judicial power which did not relate to the execution of the other authorities of the general Government (which it must be admitted are full and discretionary, within the restrictions of the Constitution itself), to refer to antecedent laws for the construction of the general words they use: Or, 2. To enable Congress in all such cases to pass all such laws, as they might deem necessary and proper to carry the purposes of this Constitution into full effect, either absolutely at their discretion, or at least in cases where prior laws were deficient for such purposes, if any such deficiency existed.</p>
<p>The Attorney-General has indeed suggested another construction, a construction, I confess, that I never heard of before, nor can I now consider it grounded on any solid foundation, though it appeared to me to be the basis of the Attorney-General's argument. His construction I take to be this: Â— "That the moment a Supreme Court is formed, it is to exercise all the judicial power vested in it by the Constitution, by its own authority, whether the Legislature has prescribed methods of doing so, or not." My conception of the Constitution is entirely different. I conceive, that all the Courts of the United States must receive, not merely their organization as to the number of Judges of which they are to consist; but all their authority, as to the manner of their proceeding, from the Legislature only. This appears to me to be one of those cases, with many others, in which an article of the Constitution cannot be effectuated without the intervention of the Legislative authority. There being many such, at the end of the special enumeration of the powers of Congress in the Constitution, is this general one: "To make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing Powers, and all other powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States, or in any department or officer thereof." None will deny, that an act of Legislation is necessary to say, at least of what number the Judges are to consist; the President with the consent of the Senate could not nominate a number at their <span class="star-pagination">*433</span> discretion. The Constitution intended this article so far at least to be the subject of a Legislative act. Having a right thus to establish the Court, and it being capable of being established in no other manner, I conceive it necessarily follows, that they are also to direct the manner of its proceedings. Upon this authority, there is, that I know, but one limit; that is, "that they shall not exceed their authority." If they do, I have no hesitation to say, that any act to that effect would be utterly void, because it would be inconsistent with the Constitution, which is a fundamental law paramount to all others, which we are not only bound to consult, but sworn to observe; and, therefore, where there is an interference, being superior in obligation to the other, we must unquestionably obey that in preference. Subject to this restriction, the whole business of organizing the Courts, and directing the methods of their proceeding where necessary, I conceive to be in the discretion of Congress. If it shall be found on this occasion, or on any other, that the remedies now in being are defective, for any purpose it is their duty to provide for, they no doubt will provide others. It is their duty to legislate so far as is necessary to carry the Constitution into effect. It is ours only to judge. We have no reason, nor any more right to distrust their doing their duty, than they have to distrust that we all do ours. There is no part of the Constitution that I know of, that authorises this Court to take up any business where they left it, and, in order that the powers given in the Constitution may be in full activity, supply their omission by making new laws for new cases; or, which I take to be same thing, applying old principles to new cases materially different from those to which they were applied before.</p>
<p>With regard to the Attorney-General's doctrine of incidents, that was founded entirely on the supposition of the other I have been considering. The authority contended for is certainly not one of those necessarily incident to all Courts merely as such.</p>
<p>If therefore, this Court is to be (as I consider it) the organ of the Constitution and the law, not of the Constitution only in respect to the manner of its proceeding, we must receive our directions from the Legislature in this particular, and have no right to constitute ourselves an officina brevium, or take any other short method of doing what the Constitution has chosen (and, in my opinion, with the most perfect propriety) should be done in another manner.</p>
<p>But the act of Congress has not been altogether silent upon this subject. The 14th sect. of the judicial act, provides in the following words: "All the before mentioned Courts of the United States, shall have power to issue writs of scire facias, habeas corpus, and all other writs not specially provided for by statute, which may be necessary for the exercise of their respective <span class="star-pagination">*434</span> jurisdictions, and agreeable to the principles and usages of law." These words refer as well to the Supreme Court as to the other Courts of the United States. Whatever writs we issue, that are necessary for the exercise of our jurisdiction, must be agreeable to the principles and usages of law. This is a direction, I apprehend, we cannot supercede, because it may appear to us not sufficiently extensive. If it be not, we must wait till other remedies are provided by the same authority. From this it is plain that the Legislature did not chuse to leave to our own discretion the path to justice, but has prescribed one of its own. In doing so, it has, I think, wisely, referred us to principles and usages of law already well known, and by their precision calculated to guard against that innovating spirit of Courts of Justice, which the Attorney-General in another case reprobated with so much warmth, and with whose sentiments in that particular, I most cordially join. The principles of law to which reference is to be had, either upon the general ground I first alluded to, or upon the special words I have above cited, from the judicial act, I apprehend, can be, either, 1st. Those of the particular laws of the State, against which the suit is brought. Or, 2d. Principles of law common to all the States. I omit any consideration arising from the word "usages," tho' a still stronger expression. In regard to the principles of the particular laws of the State of Georgia, if they in any manner differed, so as to effect this question, from the principles of law, common to all the States, it might be material to enquire, whether, there would be any propriety or congruity in laying down a rule of decision which would induce this consequence, that an action would lie in the Supreme Court against some States, whose laws admitted of a compulsory remedy against their own Governments, but not against others, wherein no such remedy was admitted, or which would require, perhaps, if the principle was received, fifteen different methods of proceeding against States, all standing in the same political relation to the general Government, and none having any pretence to a distinction in its favor, or justly liable to any distinction to its prejudice. If any such difference existed in the laws of the different States, there would seem to be a propriety, in order to induce uniformity, (if a Constitutional power for that purpose exists), that Congress should prescribe a rule, fitted to this new case, to which no equal, uniform, and impartial mode of proceeding could otherwise be applied.</p>
<p>But this point, I conceive, it is unnecessary to determine, because I believe there is no doubt that neither in the State now in question, nor in any other in the Union, any particular Legislative mode, authorising a compulsory suit for the recovery of money against a State, was in being either when the Constitution <span class="star-pagination">*435</span> was adopted, or at the time the judicial act was passed. Since that time an act of Assembly for such a purpose has been passed in Georgia. But that surely could have no influence in the construction of an act of the Legislature of the United States passed before.</p>
<p>The only principles of law, then, that can be regarded, are those common to all the States. I know of none such, which can affect this case, but those that are derived from what is properly termed "the common law," a law which I presume is the ground-work of the laws in every State in the Union, and which I consider, so far as it is applicable to the peculiar circumstances of the country, and where no special act of Legislation controuls it, to be in force in each State, as it existed in England, (unaltered by any statute) at the time of the first settlement of the country. The statutes of England that are in force in America differ perhaps in all the States; and, therefore, it is probable the common law in each, is in some respects different. But it is certain that in regard to any common law principle which can influence the question before us no alteration has been made by any statute, which could occasion the least material difference, or have any partial effect. No other part of the common law of England, it appears to me, can have any reference to this subject, but that part of it which prescribes remedies against the crown. Every State in the Union in every instance where its sovereignty has not been delegated to the United States, I consider to be as compleatly sovereign, as the United States are in respect to the powers surrendered. The United States are sovereign as to all the powers of Government actually surrendered: Each State in the Union is sovereign as to all the powers reserved. It must necessarily be so, because the United States have no claim to any authority but such as the States have surrendered to them: Of course the part not surrendered must remain as it did before. The powers of the general Government, either of a Legislative or Executive nature, or which particularly concerns Treaties with Foreign Powers, do for the most part (if not wholly) affect individuals, and not States: They require no aid from any State authority. This is the great leading distinction between the old articles of consederation, and the present constitution. The Judicial power is of a peculiar kind. It is indeed commensurate with the ordinary Legislative and Executive powers of the general government, and the Power which concerns treaties. But it also goes further. Where certain parties are concerned, although the subject in controversy does not relate to any of the special objects of authority of the general Government, wherein the separate sovereignties of the States are blended in one common mass of supremacy, yet the general Government has a Judicial Authority in regard to such <span class="star-pagination">*436</span> subjects of controversy, and the Legislature of the United States may pass all laws necessary to give such Judicial Authority its proper effect. So far as States under the Constitution can be made legally liable to this authority, so far to be sure they are subordinate to the authority of the United States, and their individual sovereignty is in this respect limited. But it is limited no farther than the necessary execution of such authority requires. The authority extends only to the decision of controversies in which a State is a party, and providing laws necessary for that purpose. That surely can refer only to such controversies in which a State can be a party; in respect to which, if any question arises, it can be determined, according to the principles I have supported, in no other manner than by a reference either to pre-existent laws, or laws passed under the Constitution and in conformity to it.</p>
<p>Whatever be the true construction of the Constitution in this particular; whether it is to be construed as intending merely a transfer of jurisdiction from one tribunal to another, or as authorising the Legislature to provide laws for the decision of all possible controversies in which a State may be involved with an individual, without regard to any prior exemption; yet it is certain that the Legislature has in fact proceeded upon the former supposition, and not upon the latter. For, besides what I noticed before as to an express reference to principles and usages of law as the guide of our proceeding, it is observable that in instances like this before the Court, this Court hath a concurrent jurisdiction only; the present being one of those cases where by the judicial act this Court hath original but not exclusive jurisdiction. This Court, therefore, under that act, can exercise no authority in such instances, but such authority as from the subject matter of it may be exercised in some other Court. Â— There are no Courts with which such a concurrence can be suggested but the Circuit Courts, or Courts of the different States. With the former it cannot be, for admitting that the Constitution is not to have a restrictive operation, so as to confine all cases in which a State is a party exclusively to the Supreme Court (an opinion to which I am strongly inclined), yet there are no words in the definition of the powers of the Circuit Court which give a colour to an opinion, that where a suit is brought against a State by a citizen of another State, the Circuit Court could exercise any jurisdiction at all. If they could, however, such a jurisdiction, by the very terms of their authority, could be only concurrent with the Courts of the several States. It follows, therefore, unquestionably, I think, that looking at the act of Congress, which I consider is on this occasion the limit of our authority (whatever further might be constitutionaly, enacted) we can exercise no authority in the present instance <span class="star-pagination">*437</span> consistently with the clear intention of the act, but such as a proper State Court would have been at least comepetent to exercise at the time the act was passed.</p>
<p>If therefore, no new remedy be provided (as plainly is the case), and consequently we have no other rule to govern us but the principles of the pre-existent laws, which must remain in force till superceded by others, then it is incumbent upon us to enquire, whether previous to the adoption of the Constitution (which period, or the period of passing the law, in respect to the object of this enquiry, is perfectly equal) an action of the nature like this before the Court could have been maintained against one of the States in the Union upon the principles of the common law, which I have shewn to be alone applicable. If it could, I think it is now maintainable here: If it could not, I think, as the law stands at present, it is not maintainable; whatever opinion may be entertained, upon the construction of the Constitution, as to the power of Congress to authorise such a one. Now I presume it will not be denied, that in every State in the Union, previous to the adoption of the Constitution, the only common law principles in regard to suits that were in any manner admissible in respect to claims against the State, were those which in England apply to claims against the crown; there being certainly no other principles of the common law which, previous to the adoption of this Constitution could, in any manner, or upon any colour, apply to the case of a claim against a State in its own Courts, where it was solely and completely sovereign in respect to such cases at least. Whether that remedy was strictly applicable or not, still I apprehend there was no other. The only remedy in a case like that before the Court, by which, by any possibility, a suit can be maintained against the crown in England, or could be at any period from which the common law, as in force in America, could be derived, I believe is that which is called a Petition of right. It is stated, indeed, in Com. Dig. 105. That "until the time of Edward I. the King might have been sued in all actions as a common person." And some authorities are cited for that position, though it is even there stated as a doubt. But the same authority adds Â— "but now none can have an action against the King, but one shall be put to sue to him by petition." This appears to be a quotation or abstract from Theloall's Digest, which is also one of the authorities quoted in the former case. And this book appears (from the law catalogue) to have been printed so long ago as the year 1579. The same doctrine appears (according to a quotation in Blackstone's Commentaries, 1 Vol. 243) to be stated in Finch's Law 253, the first edition of which, it seems, was published in 1579. This also more fully appears in the case of the Bankers, and particularly from the celebrated argument of <span class="star-pagination">*438</span> Lord Somers, in the time of W. III. for, though that case was ultimately decided against Lord Somers's opinion, yet the ground on which the decision was given no way invalidates the reasoning of that argument, so far as it respects the simple case of a sum of money demandable from the King, and not by him secured on any particular revenues. The case is reported in Freeman, Vol. 1. p. 331. 5 Mod. 29. Skinn. 601. and lately very elaborately in a small pamphlet published by Mr. Hargrave, which contains all the reports at length, except Skinner's, together with the argument at large of Lord Somers; besides some additional matter.</p>
<p>The substance of the case was as follows: Â— King Charles II. having received large sums of money from bankers, on the credit of the growing produce of the revenue, for the payment of which, tallies and orders of the Exchequer were given (afterwards made transferable by statute) and the payment of these having been afterward postponed, the King at length, in order to relieve the Bankers, in 1677, granted annuities to them out of the hereditary Excise, equal to 6 per cent interest on their several debts, but redeemable on payment of the principal. This interest was paid 'till 1683, but it then became in arrear, and continued so at the Revolution; and the suits which were commenced to enforce the payment of these arrears, were the subject of this case. The Bankers presented a petition to the Barons of the Exchequer, for the payment of the arrears of the annuities granted; to which petition the Attorney General demurred. Two points were made: First, whether the grant out of the Excise was good; second, whether a petition to the Barons of the Exchequer was a proper remedy. On the first point the whole Court agreed, that in general the King could alienate the revenues of the crown; but Mr. Baron Lechmere differed from the other Barons, by thinking that this particular revenue of the Excise, was an exception to the general rule. But all agreed, that the petition was a proper remedy. Judgment was therefore given for the petition by directing payment to the complainants at the receipt of the Exchequer. A writ of Error was brought on this judgment by the Attorney General in the Exchequer-Chamber. There all the judges who argued held the grant out of the Excise good. A majority of them, including Lord Chief Justice Holt, also approved of the remedy by petition to the Barons. But, Lord Chief Justice Treby was of opinion, that the Barons of the Exchequer were not authorised to make order for payments on the receipt of the Exchequer, and, therefore, that the remedy by petition to the Barons was inapplicable. In this opinion Lord Somers concurred. A doubt then arose, whether the Lord Chancellor and Lord High Treasurer were at liberty to give judgment according to their own <span class="star-pagination">*439</span> opinion, in opposition to that of a majority of the attendant Judges; in other words, whether the Judges called by the Lord Chancellor and Lord High Treasurer were to be considered as mere assistants to them without voices. The opinion of the Judges being taken on this point, seven against three held, that the Lord Chancellor and Lord Treasurer were not concluded by the opinions of the Judges, and therefore that the Lord Keeper in the case in question, there being then no Lord Treasurer, might give judgment according to his own opinion. Lord Somers concurring in this idea, reversed the judgment of the Court of Exchequer. But the case was afterwards carried by error into Parliament, and there the Lords reversed the judgment of the Exchequer-Chamber, and affirmed that of the Exchequer. However, notwithstanding this final decision in favour of the Bankers and their creditors, it appears by a subsequent statute, that they were to receive only one half of their debts; the 12 and 14 W. 3. after appropriating certain sums out of the hereditary Excise for public uses, providing, that in lieu of the annuities granted to the Bankers and all arrears, the hereditary Excise should, after the 26th of December 1601, be charged with annual sums equal to an interest of three per cent, till redeemed by payment of one moiety of the principal sums. Hargrave's case of the Bankers, 1, 2, 3.</p>
<p>Upon perusing the whole of this case, these inferences naturally follow: Â— 1st. That admitting the authority of that decision in its fullest extent, yet it is an authority only in respect to such cases, where letters patent from the crown have been granted for the payment of certain sums out of a particular revenue. 2d. That such relief was grantable in the Exchequer, upon no other principle than that that Court had a right to direct the issues of the Exchequer as well after the money was deposited there as while (in the Exchequer language) it was in transitu. 3d. That such an authority could not have been exercised by any other Court in Westminster-Hall, or by any Court that from its particular constitution had no conrroul over the revenues of the Kingdom. Lord G.J. Holt, and Lord Somers (though they differed in the main point) both agreed in that case, that the Court of King's bench could not send a writ to the Treasury. Hargrave's case, 45, 89. Consequently, no such remedy could, under any circumstances, I apprehend, be allowed in any of the American States, in none of which it is presumed any Court of Justice hath any express authority over the revenues of the State such as has been attributed to the Court of Exchequer in England.</p>
<p>The observations of Lord Somers, concerning the general remedy by petition to the King, have been extracted and referred to by some of the ablest law characters since; particularly by <span class="star-pagination">*440</span> Lord C. Baron Comyns in his digest. I shall, therefore, extract some of them, as he appears to have taken uncommon pains to collect all the material learning on the subject; and indeed is said to have expended several hundred pounds in the procuring of records relative to that case. Hargrave's preface to the case of the Bankers.</p>
<p>After citing many authorities, Lord Somers proceeds thus: Â— "By all there authorities, and by many others, which I could cite, both ancient and modern, it is plain, that if the subject was to recover a rent, or annuity, or other charge from the crown; whether it was a rent or annuity, originally granted by the King; or issuing out of lands, which by subsequent title came to be in the King's hands; in all cases the remedy to come at it was by petition to the person of the King: and no other method can be shewn to have been practised at common law. Indeed I take it to be generally true, that in all cases where the subject is in the nature of a Plaintiff, to recover any thing from the King, his only remedy, at common law, is to sue by Petition to the person of the King. I say, where the subject comes as a Plaintiff. For, as I said before, when, upon a title found for the King, by office, the subject comes in to traverse the King's title, or to shew his own right, he comes in the nature of a Defendant; and is admitted to interplead in the case with the King in defence of his title, which otherwise would be defeated by finding the office. And to shew that this was so, I would take notice of several instances. That, in cases of debts owing by the crown, the subject's remedy was by Petition, appears by Aynesham's case, Ryley, 251. which is a petition for Â£19. due for work done at Carnarvon castle. So Ryley 251. The executors of John Estrateling petition for Â£132. due to the testator for wages. The answer is remarkable; for there is a latitude taken, which will very well agree with the notion that is taken up in this case: Habeant bre. de liberate in Canc. thes. &amp; camevar. de Â£32, in partem solutionis. So the case of Yerward de Galeys, for Â£56. Ryley 414. In like manner in the same book 253. 33. Ed. I. several parties sue by petition for money and goods taken for the King's use; and also for wages due to them; and for debts owing to them by the King. The answer is, Ren ordinavit per concilium thesaurarii &amp; baronum de scaccario, quod satisfied iis quam citius fieri poterit; ita quod conterros fe tenebunt. And this is an answer given to a petition presented to the King in Parliament; and therefore we have reason to conclude it to be warranted by law. They must be content, and they shall be paid, quam citius fieri polerit. The parties, in these cases, first go to the King by petition: it is by him they are sent to the Exchequer; and it is by writ under the great seal, that the Exchequer is impowered to act. Nor can <span class="star-pagination">*441</span> any such writ be found (unless in a very few instances, where it is mere matter of account) in which the Treasurer is not joined with the Barons. So far was it from being taken to be law at that time, that the Barons had any original power of paying the King's debts; or of commanding annuities, granted by the King or his progenitors, to be paid, when the person applied to them for such payment. But perhaps it may be objected, that it is not to be inferred, because petitions were brought in these cases, that therefore it was of necessity that the subject should pursue that course, and could take no other way. It might be reasonable to require from those who object thus, that they should produce some precedents at least, of another remedy taken. But I think there is a good answer to be given to this objection. All these petitions which I have mentioned, are after the Stat. 8 Ed. I. Ryley 442, where notice is taken that the business of Parliament is interrupted by a multitude of petitions, which might be redressed by the Chancellor and Justices. Wherefore it is thereby enacted, that petitions which touch the seal shall come first to the Chancellor; those which touch the Exchequer, to the Exchequer; and those which touch the Justices, or the law of the land, should come to the Justices; and if the business be so great, or si de grace that the Chancellor, or others, cannot do them without the King, then the petitions shall be brought before the King to know his pleasure; so that no petitions come before the King and his Council, but by the hands of the Chancellor, and other chief Ministers; that the King and his Council may attend the great affairs of the King's Realm, and his sovereign dominions." This law being made; there is reason to conclude that all petitions brought before the King or Parliament after this time, and answered there, were brought according to the method of this law; and were of the nature of such petitions as ought to be brought before the person of the King. And that petitions did lie for a chattel, as well as for a freehold, does appear 37 Ass. pl ii. Bro. Pet. 17. If tenant by the statute merchant be ousted, he may have petition, and shall be restored. Vide 9 H. 4. 4. Bro. Pet. 9. 9. H. 6. 21. Bro. Pet. 2. If the subject be ousted of his term, he shall have his petition. 7. H. 7. ii. Of a chattel real a man shall have his petition of right, as of his freehold. 34. H. 6. 51. Bro. Pet. 3. A man shall have a petition of right for goods and chattels, and the King indorses it in the usual form. It is said indeed, 1 H. 7. 3. Bro. Pet. 19. that a petition will not lie of a chattel. And, admitting there was any doubt as to that point, in the present suit we are in the case of a freehold." Lord Somers's argument in Hargrave's case of the Bankers, 103 to 105.</p>
<p>The solitary case, noticed at the conclusion of Lord Somers's argument, "that a petition will not lie of a chattel," certainly <span class="star-pagination">*442</span> is deserving of no consideration, opposed to so many other instances mentioned, and unrecognized (as I believe it is) by any other authority either ancient or modern, whereas the contrary, it appears to me, has long been received and established law. In Comyns's Dig. 4 Vol. 458. It is said expressly "suit shall be to the King by petition, for goods as well as for land." He cites Staundf. PrÃ¦r. 75. b. 72. b. for his authority, and takes no notice of any authority to the contrary. The same doctrine is also laid down with equal explicitness, and without noticing any distinction whatever, in Blackstone's Commentaries, 3 Vol. 256. where he points out the petition of right as one of the common law methods of obtaining possession or restitution from the crown, either of real or personal property; and says expressly the petition of right "is of use where the King is in full possession of any hereditaments or chattels, and the petitioner suggests such a right as controverts the title of the crown, grounded on facts disclosed in the petition itself."</p>
<p>I leave out of the argument, from which I have made so long a quotation, every thing concerning the restriction on the Exchequer, so far as it concerned the case then before the Court, as Lord Somers (although more perhaps by weight of authority than reasoning) was over-ruled in that particular. As to all others I consider the authorities on which he relied, and his deduction from them, to be unimpeached.</p>
<p>Blackstone, in the first volume of his commentaries (p. 203), speaking of demands in point of property, upon the King, states the general remedy thus: Â— "If any person has, in point of property, a just demand upon the King, he must petition him in his Court of Chancery, where his Chancellor will administer right, as a matter of grace, though not upon compulsion. (For which he cites Finch L. 255.) "And this is exactly consonant to what is laid down by the writers on natural law. Â— A subject, say Puffendorf, so long as he continues a subject, hath no way to oblige his Prince to give him his due when he refuses it; though no wife Prince will ever refuse to stand to a lawful contract. And if the Prince gives the subject leave to enter an action against him upon such contract, in his own Courts, the action itself proceeds rather upon natural equity, than upon the municipal laws. For the end of such action is not to compel the Prince to observe the contract, but to pursuade him."</p>
<p>It appears, that when a petition to the person of the King is properly presented, the usual way is for the King to indorse or underwrite, soit droit fait al partie, (let right be done to the party); upon which, unless the Attorney-General confesses the suggestion, a commission is issued to enquire into the truth of it: after the return of which, the King's attorney is at liberty to <span class="star-pagination">*443</span> plead in bar, and the merits shall be determined upon issue or demurrer, as in suits between subject and subject. If the Attorney-General confesses the suggestion there is no occasion for a commission, his admission of the truth of the facts being equally conclusive as if they had been found by a jury. Â— See 3 Blackstone's Commentaries 256. and 4 Com. Dig. 458. and the authorities there cited. Though the above mentioned indorsement be the usual one, Lord Somers, in the course of his voluminous search, discovered a variety of other answers to what he considered were unquestionable petitions of right; in respect to which he observes: "The truth is, the manner of answering petitions to the person of the King was very various; which variety did sometimes arise from the conclusion of the party's petition; sometimes from the nature of the thing; and sometimes from favour to the person; and according as the indorsement was, the party was sent into Chancery, or the other Courts. If the indorsement was general, soit droit fait al partie, it must be delivered to the Chancellor of England, and then a commission was to go to find the right of the party; and that being found, so that there was a record so rhim, thus warranted, he is let in to interplead with the King: but if the indorsement was special, then the proceeding was to be according to the indorsement in any other Court. This is fully explained by Stamford, (Staundfort) in his treatise of the Prerog. c. 22. The case Mich. 10 H. 4. 4. no. 8. is full as to this matter. The King recovers in a Quare impedit by default against one who was never summoned; the party cannot have a writ of deceit without a petition. If then, says the book, he concludes his petition generally "que le Roy lui face droit" (that the King will cause right to be done) and the answer be general, it must go into the Chancery, that the right may inquired of by commission; and, upon the inquest sound, an original writ must be directed to the Justices to examine the deceit; otherwise, the Justices, before whom the suit was, cannot moddle: But if he conclude his petition especially, that it may please his Highness to command his Justices to proceed to the examination, and the indorsement be accordingly, that had given the Justices a jurisdiction. They might in such case have proceeded upon the petition without any commission, or any writ to be sued out; the petition and answer indorsed giving a sufficient jurisdiction to the Court to which it was directed. And as the book I have mentioned proves this, so many other authorities may be cited." He accordingly mentions many other instances, immaterial to be recitedhere, particularly remarking a very extraordinary difference in the case belonging to the revenue, in regard to which he said, he thought there was not an instance to be found where petitions were answered, soit droit fait aux parties (let right be done <span class="star-pagination">*444</span> to the parties): The usual reference appears to have been to the Treasurer and Barons, commanding them to do justice: Sometimes a writ under the great seal was directed to be issued to them for that purpose: Sometimes a writ from the Chancery directing payment of money immediately, without taking notice of the Barons. And other varieties appear to have taken place. See Hargrave's case of the Bankers, p. 73, &amp; seq. But in all cases of petition of right, of whatever nature is the demand, I think it is clear beyond all doubt, that there must be some indorsement or order of the King himself to warrant any further proceedings. The remedy, in the language of Blackstone, being a matter of grace, and not on compulsion.</p>
<p>In a very late case in England, this point was incidentally discussed. The case I refer to, is the case of Macbeath against Haldimand, reported 1st Durnford &amp; East 172. The action was against the Defendant, for goods furnished by the Defendant's order in Canada, when the Defendant was Governor of Quebec. The defence was, that the Plaintiff was employed by the Defendant in his official capacity, and not upon his personal credit, and that the goods being therefore furnished for the use of Government, and the Defendant not having undertaken personally to pay, he was not liable. This defence was set up at the trial on the plea of the general issue, and the Jury, by. Judge Buller's direction, found a verdict for the Defendant. Ugon a motion for a new trial he reported particularly all the facts given in evidence, and said his opinion had been at the trial that the Plaintiff should be non-suited; "but the Plaintiff's counsel appearing for their client, when he was called, he left the question to the Jury, telling them that they were bound to find for the Defendant in point of law. And upon their asking him whether, in the event of the Defendant not being liable, any other person was, he told them, that was no part of their consideration, but being willing to give them any information, he added, that he was of opinion, that if the Plaintiff's demands were just, his proper remedy was by a Petition of right to the crown. On which they found a verdict for the Defendant. The rule for granting a new trial was moved for, on the misdirection of two points. 1st. That the Defendant had by his own conduct made himself liable, which question should have been left to the Jury. 2dly. That the Plaintiff had no remedy against the crown by a Petition of right, on the supposition of which the Jury had been induced to give their verdict." "Lord Mansfield, Chief Justice, now declared, that the Court did not feel it necessary for them to give any opinion on the second ground. His Lordship said that great difference had arisen since the revolution with respect to the expenditure of the public money. Before that period, all the public supplies were given to the King, who in <span class="star-pagination">*445</span> his individual capacity contracted for all expences. He alone had the disposition of the public money. But since that time the supplies had been appropriated by Parliament to particular purposes, and now, whoever advances money for the public service trusts to the faith of Parliament. That according to the tenor of Lord Somers's argument in the Bankers case, though a Petition of right would lie, yet it would probably produce no effect. No benefit was ever derived from it in the Bankers case; and Parliament was afterwards obliged to provide a particular fund for the payment of those debts. Whether, however, this alteration in the mode of distributing the supplies had made any difference in the law upon this subject, it was unnecessary to determine; at any rate, if there were a recovery against the crown, application must be made to Parliament, and it would come under the head of supplies for the year." The motion was afterwards argued on the other ground (with which I have at present nothing to do) and rejected.</p>
<p>In the old authorities there does not appear any distinction between debts that might be contracted personally by the King, for his own private use, and such as he contracted in his political capacity for the service of the kingdom. As he had however then fixed and independent revenues, upon which depended the ordinary support of Government, as well as the expenditure for his own private occasions, probably no material distinction at that time existed, or could easily be made. A very important distinction may however perhaps now subsist between the two cases, for the reasons intimated by Lord Mansfield; since the whole support of Government depends now on Parliamentary provisions, and, except in the case of the civil lift, those for the most part annual.</p>
<p>Thus, it appears, that in England even in case of a private debt contracted by the King, in his own person, there is no remedy but by petition, which must receive his express sanction, otherwise there can be no proceeding upon it. If the debt contracted be avowedly for the public uses of Government, it is at least doubtful whether that remedy will lie, and if it will, it remains afterwards in the power of Parliament to provide for it or not among the current supplies of the year.</p>
<p>Now let us consider the case of a debt due from a State. None can, I apprehend, be directly claimed but in the following instances. 1st. In case of a contract with the Legislature itself. 2d. In case of a contract with the Executive, or any other person, in consequence of an express authority from the Legislature. 3d. In case of a contract with the Executive without any special authority. In the first and second cases, the contract is evidently made on the public faith alone. Every man must know that no suit can lie against a Legislative body. His only <span class="star-pagination">*446</span> dependence therefore can be, that the Legislature on principles of public duty, will make a provision for the execution of their own contracts, and if that fails, whatever reproach the Legislature may incur, the case is certainly without remedy in any of the Courts of the State. It never was pretended, even in the case of the crown in England, that if any contract was made with Parliament, or with the crown by virtue of an authority from Parliament, that a Petition to the crown would in such case lie. In the third case, a contract with the Governor of a State without any special authority. This case is entirely different from such a contract made with the crown in England. The crown there has very high prerogatives, in many instances is a kind of trustee for the public interest, in all cases represents the sovereignty of the Kingdom, and is the only authority which can sue or be sued in any manner on behalf of the Kingdom in any Court of Justice. A Governor of a State is a mere Executive officer; his general authority very narrowly limited by the Constitution of the State; with no undefined or disputable prerogatives; without power to effect one shilling of the public money, but as he is authorised under the Constitution, or by a particular law; having no colour to represent the sovereignty of the State, so as to bind it in any manner to its prejudice, unless specially authorised thereto. And therefore all who contract with him do it at their own peril, and are bound to see (or take the consequence of their own indiscretion) that he has strict authority for any contract he makes. Of course such contract when so authorised will come within the description I mentioned of cases where public faith alone is the ground of relief, and the Legislative body the only one that can afford a remedy, which from the very nature of it must be the effect of its discretion, and not of any compulsory process. If however any such cases were similar to those which would entitle a party to relief by petition to the King in England, that Petition being only presentable to him as he is the sovereign of the Kingdom, so far as analogy is to take place, such Petition in a State could only be presented to the sovereign power, which surely the Governor is not. The only constituted authority to which such an application could with any propriety be made, must undoubtedly be the Legislature, whose express consent, upon the principle of analogy, would be necessary to any further proceeding. So that this brings us (though by a different route) to the same goal; The discretion and good faith of the Legislative body.</p>
<p>There is no other part of the common law, besides that which I have considered, which can by any person be pretended in any manner to apply to this case, but that which concerns corporations. The applicability of this, the Attorney-General, with great candour, has expressly waved. But as it may be <span class="star-pagination">*447</span> urged on other occasions, and as I wish to give the fullest satisfaction, I will say a few words to that doctrine. Suppose, therefore, it should be objected, that the reasoning I have now used is not conclusive, because, inasmuch as a State is made subject to the judicial power of Congress, its sovereignty must not stand in the way of the proper exercise of that power, and, therefore, in all such cases (though in no other) a State can only be considered as a subordinate corporation merely. I answer, 1st. That this construction can only be allowed, at the utmost, upon the supposition that the judicial authority of the United States, as it respects States, cannot be effectuated, without proceeding against them in that light: a position I by no means admit. 2d. That according to the principles I have supported in this argument, admitting that States ought to be so considered for that purpose, an act of the Legislature is necessary to give effect to such a construction, unless the old doctrine concerning corporations will naturally apply to this particular case. 3d. That as it is evident the act of Congress has not made any special provision in this case, grounded on any such construction, so it is to my mind perfectly clear that we have no authority, upon any supposed analogy between the two cases, to apply the common doctrine concerning corporations, to the important case now before the Court. I take it for granted, that when any part of an antient law is to be applied to a new case the circumstances of the new case must agree in all essential points with the circumstances of the old cases to which that antient law was formerly appropriated. Now there are, in my opinion, the most essential differences between the old cases of corporations to which the law intimated has reference, and the great and extraordinary case of States separately possessing, as to every thing simply relating to themselves, the fullest powers of sovereignty, and yet in some other defined particulars subject to a superior power composed out of themselves for the common welfare of the whole. The only law concerning corporations, to which I conceive the least reference is to be had, is the common law of England on that subject. I need not repeat the observations I made in respect to the operation of that law in this country. The word "corporations," in its largest sense, has a more extensive meaning than people generally are aware of. Any body politic (sole or aggregate) whether its power be restricted or transcendant, is in this sense "a corporation." The King, accordingly, in England is called a corporation. 10 Co. 29. b. So also, by a very respectable author (Sheppard, in his abridgement, 1 Vol. 431.) is the Parliament itself. In this extensive sense, not only each State singly, but even the United States may without impropriety be termed "corporations." I have, therefore, in contradistinction to this large and indefinite <span class="star-pagination">*448</span> term, used the term "subordinate corporations," meaning to refer to such only (as alone capable of the slightest application, for the purpose of the objection) whose creation and whose powers are limited by law.</p>
<p>The differences between such corporations, and the several States in the Union, as relative to the general Government, are very obvious in the following particulars. 1st. A corporation is a mere creature of the King, or of Parliament; very rarely of the latter; most usually of the former only. It owes its existence, its name, and its laws, (except such laws as are necessarily incident to all corporations merely as such) to the authority which create it. A State does not owe its origin to the Government of the United States, in the highest or in any of its branches. It was in existence before it. It derives its authority from the same pure and sacred source as itself: The voluntary and deliberate choice of the people. 2d. A corporation can do no act but what is subject to the revision either of a Court of Justice, or of some other authority within the Government. A State is altogether exempt from the jurisdiction of the Courts of the United States, or from any other exterior authority, unless in the special instances where the general Government has power derived from the Constitution itself. 3d. A corporation is altogether dependant on that Government to which it owes its existence. Its charter may be forfeited by abuse. Its authority may be annihilated, without abuse, by an act of the Legislative body. A State, though subject in certain specified particulars to the authority of the Government of the United States, is in every other respect totally independent upon it. The people of the State created, the people of the State can only change, its Constitution. Upon this power there is no other limitation but that imposed by the Constitution of the United States; that it must be of the Republican form. I omit minuter distinctions. These are so palpable, that I never can admit that a system of law calculated for one of these cases is to be appllied, as a matter of course, to the other, without admitting (as I conceive) that the distinct boundaries of law and Legislation may be confounded, in a manner that would make Courts arbitrary, and in effect makers of a new law, instead of being (as certainly they alone ought to be) expositors of an existing one. If still it should be insisted, that though a State cannot be considered upon the same footing as the municipal corporations I have been considering, yet, as relative to the powers of the General Government it must be deemed in some measure dependent; admitting that to be the case (which to be sure is, so far as the necessary execution of the powers of the General Government extends) yet in whatever character this may place a State, this can only afford a reason for a new law; <span class="star-pagination">*449</span> calculated to effectuate the powers of the General Government in this new case: But it affords no reason whatever for the Court admitting a new action to fit a case, to which no old ones apply, when the application of law, not the making of it, is the sole province of the Court.</p>
<p>I have now, I think, established the following particulars. Â— Ist. That the Constitution, so far as it respects the judicial authority, can only be carried into effect by acts of the Legislature appointing Courts, and prescribing their methods of proceeding. 2d. That Congress has provided no new law in regard to this case, but expressly referred us to the old. 3d. That there are no principles of the old law, to which we must have recourse, that in any manner authorise the present suit, either by precedent or by analogy. The consequence of which, in my opinion, clearly is, that the suit in question cannot be maintained, nor, of course, the motion made upon it be complied with.</p>
<p>From the manner in which I have viewed this subject, so different from that in which it has been contemplated by the Attorney General, it is evident, that I have not had occasion to notice many arguments offered by the Attorney General, which certainly were very proper, as to his extended view of the case, but do not affect mine. No part of the Law of Nations can apply to this case, as I apprehend, but that part which is termed "The Conventional Law of Nations;" nor can this any otherwise apply than as furnishing rules of interpretation, since unquestionably the people of the United States had a right to form what kind of union, and upon what terms they pleased, without reference to any former examples. If upon a fair construction of the Constitution of the United States, the power contended for really exists, it undoubtedly may be exercised, though it be a power of the first impression. If it does not exist, upon that authority, ten thousand examples of similar powers would not warrant its assumption. So far as this great question affects the Constitution itself, if the present afforded, consistently with the particular grounds of my opinion, a proper occasion for a decision upon it, I would not shrink from its discussion. But it is of extreme moment that no Judge should rashly commit himself upon important questions, which it is unnecessary for him to decide. My opinion being, that even if the Constitution would admit of the exercise of such a power, a new law is necessary for the purpose, since no part of the existing law applies, this alone is sufficient to justify my determination in the present case. So much, however, has been said on the Constitution, that it may not be improper to intimate that my present opinion is strongly against any construction of it, which will admit, under any circumstances, a compulsive suit against a State for the recovery of money. I <span class="star-pagination">*450</span> think every word in the Constitution may have its full effect without involving this consequence, and that nothing but express words, or an insurmountable implication (neither of which I consider, can be found in this case) would authorise the deduction of so high a power. This opinion I hold, however, with all the reserve proper for one, which, according to my sentiments in this case, may be deemed in some measure extra-judicial. With regard to the policy of maintaining such suits, that is not for this Court to consider, unless the point in all other respects was very doubtful. Policy might then be argued from with a view to preponderate the judgment. Upon the question before us, I have no doubt. I have therefore nothing to do with the policy. But I consess, if I was at liberty to speak on that subject, my opinion on the policy of the case would also differ from that of the Attorney General. It is, however, a delicate topic. I pray to God, that if the Attorney General's doctrine, as to the law, be established by the judgment of this Court, all the good he predicts from it may take place, and none of the evils with which, I have the concern to say, it appears to me to be pregnant.</p>
<p>BLAIR, Justice.</p>
<p>In considering this important case, I have thought it best to pass over all the strictures which have been made on the various European consederations; because, as, on the one hand, their likeness to our own is not sufficiently close to justify any analogical application; so, on the other, they are utterly destitute of any binding authority here. The Constitution of the United States is the only fountain from which I shall draw; the only authority to which I shall appeal. Whatever be the true language of that, it is obligatory upon every member of the Union; for, no State could have become a member, but by an adoption of it by the people of that State. What then do we find there requiring the submission of individual States to the judicial authority of the United States? This is expressly extended, among other things, to controversies between a State and citizens of another State. Is then the case before us one of that description? Undoubtedly it is, unless it may be a sufficient denial to say, that it is a controversy between a citizen of one State and another State. Can this change of order be an essential change in the thing intended? And is this alone a sufficient ground from which to conclude, that the jurisdiction of this Court reaches the case where a State is Plaintiff, but not where it is Defendant? In this latter case, should any man be asked, whether it was not a controversy between a State and citizen of another State, must not a answer be in the affirmative? A dispute between A. and B. is surely a dispute between B. and A. Both cases, I have no doubt, were intended; and probably the State was first named, <span class="star-pagination">*451</span> in respect to the dignity of a State. But that very dignity seems to have been thought a sufficient reason for confining the sense to the case where a State is plaintiff. It is, however, a sufficient answer to say, that our Constitution most certainly contemplates, in another banch of the cases enumerated, the maintaining a jurisdiction against a State, as Defendant; this is unequivocally asserted when the judicial power of the United States is extended to controversies between two or more States; for there, a State must, of necessity, be a Defendant. It is extended also, to controversies between a State and foreign States; and if the argument taken from the order of designation were good, it would be meant here, that this Court might have cognizance of a suit, where a State is Plaintiff, and some foreign State a Defendant, but not where a foreign State brings a suit against a State. This, however, not to mention that the instances may rarely occur, when a State may have an opportunity of suing in the American Courts a foreign State, seems to lose sight of the policy which, no doubt, suggested this provision, viz. That no State in the Union should, by withholding justice, have it in its power to embroil the whole confederacy in disputes of another nature. But if a foreign State, though last named, may, nevertheless, be a Plaintiff against an individual State, how can it be said, that a controversy between a State and a citizen of another State means, from the mere force of the order of the words, only such cases where a State is Plaintiff? After describing, generally, the judicial powers of the United States, the Constitution goes on to speak of it distributively, and gives to the Supreme Court original jurisdiction, among other instances, in the case where a State shall be a party; but is not a State a party as well in the condition of a Defendant as in that of a Plaintiff? And is the whole force of that expression satisfied by confining its meaning to the case of a Plaintiff-State? It seems to me, that if this Court should refuse to hold jurisdiction of a case where a State is Defendant, it would renounce part of the authority conferred, and, consequently, part of the duty imposed on it by the Constitution; because it would be a refusal to take cognizance of a case where a State is a party. Nor does the jurisdiction of this Court, in relation to a State, seem to me to be questionable, on the ground that Congress has not provided any form of execution, or pointed out any mode of making the judgment against a State effectual; the argument ab in utili may weigh much in cases depending upon the construction of doubtful Legislative acts, but can have no force, I think, against the clear and positive directions of an act of Congress and of the Constitution. Let us go on as far as we can; and if, at the end of the business, notwithstanding the powers given us in the 14th section <span class="star-pagination">*452</span> of the judicial law, we meet difficulties insurmountable to us, we must leave it to those departments of Government which have higher powers; to which, however, there may be no necessity to have recourse: Is it altogether a vain expectation, that a State may have other motives than such as arise from the apprehension of coercion, to carry into execution a judgment of the Supreme Court of the United States, though not conformable to their own ideas of justice? Besides, this argument takes it for granted, that the judgment of the Court will be against the State; it possibly may be in favor of the State; and the difficulty vanishes. Should judgment be given against the Plaintiff, could it be said to be void, because extra-judicial? If the Plaintiff, grounding himself upon that notion, should renew his suit against the State, in any mode in which the may permit herself to be sued in her own Courts, would the Attorney General for the State be obliged to go again into the merits of the case, because the matter, when here, was coram non judice? Might he not rely upon the judgment given by this Court in bar of the new suit? To me it seems clear that he might. And if a State may be brought before this Court, as a Defendant, I fee no reason for confining the Plaintiff to proceed by way of petition; indeed there would even seem to be an impropriety in proceeding in that mode. When sovereigns are sued in their own Courts, such a method may have been established as the most respectful form of demand; but we are not now in a State-Court; and if sovereignty be an exemption from suit in any other than the sovereign's own Courts, it follows that when a State, by adopting the Constitution, has agreed to be amenable to the judicial power of the United States, she has, in that respect, given up her right of sovereignty.</p>
<p>With respect to the service of the summons to appear, the manner in which it has been served seems to be as proper as any which could be devised for the purpose of giving notice of the suit, which is the end proposed by it, the Governor being the head of the Executive Department, and the Attorney General the law-officer, who generally represents the State in legal proceedings: And this mode is the less liable to exception, when it is considered, that in the suit brought in this Court by the State of Georgta against Brailsford<sup>[*]</sup> and others, it is conceived in the name of the Governor in behalf of the State. If the opinion which I have delivered, respecting the liability of a State to be sued in this Court, should be the opinion of the Court, it will come in course to consider, what is the proper step to be taken for inducing appearance, none having been yet entered in behalf of the Defendant. A judgment by default, in the present stage of the business, and writ of enquiry of damages, would <span class="star-pagination">*453</span> be too precipitate in any case, and too incompatible with the dignity of a State in this. Farther opportunity of appearing to defend the suit ought to be given. The conditional order moved for the last term, the consideration of which was deferred to this, seems to me to be a very proper mode; it will warn the State of the meditated consequence of a refusal to appear, and give an opportunity for more deliberate consideration. The order, I think, should be thus: `Ordered, that `unless the State of Georgia should, after due notice of this `order, by a service thereof upon the Governor and Attorney `General of the said State, cause an appearance to be entered `in behalf of the State, on the 5th day of the next Term, or `then shew cause to the contrary, judgment be then entered up `against the State, and a writ of enquiry of damages be `awarded.'</p>
<p>"WILSON, Justice.</p>
<p>This is a case of uncommon magnitude. One of the parties to it is a STATE; certainly respectable, claiming to be sovereign. The question to be determined is, whether this State, so respectable, and whose claim soars so high, is amenable to the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the United States? This question, important in itself, will depend on others, more important still; and, may, perhaps, be ultimately resolved into one, no less radical than this Â— "do the people of the United States form a NATION?"</p>
<p>A cause so conspicuous and interesting, should be carefully and accurately viewed from every possible point of sight. I shall examine it, 1st. By the principles of general jurisprudence. 2d. By the laws and practice of particular States and Kingdoms. From the law of nations little or no illustration of this subject can be expected. By that law the several States and Governments spread over our globe, are considered as forming a society, not a NATION. It has only been by a very few comprehensive minds, such as those of Elizabeth and the Fourth Henry, that this last great idea has been even contemplated. 3dly. and chiefly, I shall examine the important question before us, by the Constitution of the United States, and the legitimate result of that valuable instrument.</p>
<p>I. I am, first, to examine this question by the principles of general jurisprudence. What I shall say upon this head, I introduce by the observation of an original and profound writer, who, in the philosophy of mind, and all the sciences attendant on this prime one, has formed an Ã¦ra not less remarkable, and far more illustrious, than that formed by the justly celebrated Bacon, in another science, not prosecuted with less ability, but less dignified as to its object; I mean the philosophy of matter. Dr. Reid, in his excellent enquiry into the human mind, on the principles of common sense, speaking of the sceptical and illiberal <span class="star-pagination">*454</span> philosophy, which under bold, but false, pretentions to liberality, prevailed in many parts of Europe before he wrote, makes the following judicious remark: "The language of philosophers, with regard to the original faculties of the mind, is so adapted to the prevailing system, that it cannot fit any other; like a coat that fits the man for whom it was made, and shews him to advantage, which yet will fit very aukward upon one of a different make, although as handsome and well proportioned. It is hardly possible to make any innovation in our philosophy concerning the mind and its operations, without using new words and phrases, or giving a different meaning to those that are received." With equal propriety may this solid remark be applied to the great subject, on the principles of which the decision of this Court is to be founded. The perverted use of genus and species in logic, and of impressions and ideas in metaphysics, have never done mischief so extensive or so practically pernicious, as has been done by States and sovereigns, in politics and jurisprudence; in the politics and jurisprudence even of those, who wished and meant to be free. In the place of those expressions I intend not to substitute new ones; but the expressions themselves I shall certainly use for purposes different from those, for which hitherto they have been frequently used; and one of them I shall apply to an object still more different from that, to which it has hitherto been more frequently, I may say almost universally, applied. In these purposes, and in this application, I shall be justified by example the most splendid, and by authority the most binding; the example of the most refined as well as the most free nation known to antiquity; and the authority of one of the best Constitutions known to modern times. With regard to one of the terms Â— State Â— this authority is declared: With regard to the other Â— sovereign Â— the authority is implied only: But it is equally strong: For, in an instrument well drawn, as in a poem well composed, silence is sometimes most expressive</p>
<p>To the Constitution of the United States the term SOVEREIGN, is totally unknown. There is but one place where it could have been used with propriety. But, even in that place it would not, perhaps, have comported with the delicacy of those, who ordained and established that Constitution. They might have announced themselves "SOVEREIGN" people of the United States. But serenely conscious of the fact, they avoided the ostentatious declaration.</p>
<p>Having thus avowed my disapprobation of the purposes, for which the terms, State and sovereign, are frequently used, and of the object, to which the application of the lost of them is almost universally made; it is now proper that I should disclose the meaning, which I assign to both, and the application, <span class="star-pagination">*455</span> which I make of the latter. In doing this, I shall have occasion incidently to evince, how true it is, that States and Governments were made for made for man; and, at the same time, how true it is, that his creatures and servants have first deceived, next vilified, and, at last, oppressed their master and maker.</p>
<p>MAN, fearfully and wonderfully made, is the workmanship of his all perfect CREATOR: A State; useful and valuable as the contrivance is, is the inferior contrivance of man; and from his native dignity derives all its acquired importance. When I speak of a State as an inferior contrivance, I mean that it is a contrivance inferior only to that, which is divine: Of all human contrivances, it is certainly most transcendantly excellent. It is concerning this contrivance that Cicero says so sublimely, "Nothing, which is exhibited upon our globe, is more acceptable to that divinity, which governs the whole universe, than those communities and assemblages of men, which, lawfully associated, are denominated STATES<sup>[*]</sup>".</p>
<p>Let a State be considered as subordinate to the PEOPLE: But let every thing else be subordinate to the State. The latter part of this position is equally necessary with the former. For in the practice, and even at length, in the science of politics there has very frequently been a strong current against the natural order of things, and an inconsiderate or an interested disposition to sacrifice the end to the means. As the State has claimed precedence of the people; so, in the same inverted course of things, the Government has often claimed precedence of the State; and to this perversion in the second degree, many of the volumes of confusion concerning sovereignty owe their existence. The ministers, dignified very properly by the appellation of the magistrates, have wished, and have succeeded in their wish, to be considered as the sovereigns of the State. This second degree of perversion is confined to the old world, and begins to diminish even there: but the first degree is still too prevalent, even in the several States, of which our union is composed. By a State I mean, a complete body of free persons united together for their common benefit, to enjoy peaceably what is their own, and to do justice to others. It is an artificial person. It has its affairs and its interests: It has its rules: It has its rights: And it has its obligations. It may acquire property distinct from that of its members: It may incur debts to be discharged out of the public stock, not out of the private fortunes of individuals: It may be bound by contracts; and for damages arising from the breach of those contracts. In all our contemplations, however, concerning this <span class="star-pagination">*456</span> feigned and artificial person, we should never forget, that, in truth and nature, those, who think and speak, and act, are men.</p>
<p>Is the foregoing description of a State a true description? It will not be questioned but it is. Is there any part of this description, which intimates, in the remotest manner, that a State, any more than the men who compose it, ought not to do justice and fulfil engagements? It will not be pretended that there is. If justice is not done; if engagements are not fulfilled; is it upon general principles of right, less proper, in the case of a great number, than in the case of an individual, to secure, by compulsion, that, which will not be voluntarily performed? Less proper it surely cannotbe. The only reason, I believe, why a free man is bound byhuman laws, is, that he binds himself. Upon the same principles, upon which he becomes bound by the laws, he becomes amenable to the Courts of Justice, which are formed and authorised by those laws. If one free man, an original sovereign, may do all this; why may not an aggregate of free men, a collection of original sovereigns, do this likewise? If the dignity of each singly is undiminished; the dignity of all jointly must be unimpaired. A State, like a merchant, makes a contract. A dishonest State, like a dishonest merchant, wilfully refuses to discharge it: The latter is amenable to a Court of Justice: Upon general principles of right, shall the former when summoned to answer the fair demands of its creditor, be permitted, proteus-like, to assume a new appearance, and to insult him and justice, by declaring I am a SOVEREIGN State? Surely not. Before a claim, so contrary, in its first appearance, to the general principles of right and equality, be sustained by a just and impartial tribunal, the person, natural or artificial, entitled to make such claim, should certainly be well known and authenticated. Who, or what, is a sovereignty? What is his or its sovereignty? On this subject, the errors and the mazes are endless and inexplicable. To enumerate all, therefore, will not be expected: To take notice of some will be necessary to the full illustration of the present important cause. In one sense, the term sovereign has for its correlative, subject, In this sense, the term can receive no application; for it has no object in the Constitution of the United States. Under that Constitution there are citizens, but no subjects. "Citizen of the United States<sup>[*]</sup>". "Citizens of another State." "Citizens of different States." "A State or citizen thereof<sup>[Â†]</sup>". The term, subject, occurs, indeed, once in the instrument; but to mark the contrast strongly, the epithet "foreign"<sup>[Â‡]</sup> is prefixed. In this sense, I presume the State of Georgia has no claim upon <span class="star-pagination">*457</span> her own citizens: In this sense, I am certain, she can have no claim upon the citizens of another State.</p>
<p>In another sense, according to some writers<sup>[*]</sup>, every State, which governs itself without any dependence on another power, is a sovereign State. Whether, with regard to her own citizens, this is case of the State of Georgia; whether those citizens have done, as the individuals of England are said, by their later instructors, to have done, surrendered the Supreme Power to the State or Government, and reserved nothing to themselves; or whether, like the people of other States, and of the United States, the citizens of Georgia have reserved the Supreme Power in their own hands; and on that Supreme Power have made the State dependent, instead of being sovereign; there are questions, to which, as a Judge in this cause. I can neither know nor suggest the proper answers; though, as a citizen of the Union, I know, and am interested to know, that the most satisfactory answers can be given. As a citizen, I know the Government of that State to be republican; and my short definition of such a Government is, Â— one constructed on this principle, that the Supreme Power resides in the body of the people. As a Judge of this Court, I know, and can decide upon the knowledge, that the citizens of Georgia, when they acted upon the large scale of the Union, as a part of the "People of the United States," did not surrender the Supreme or sovereign Power to that State; but, as to the purposes of the Union, retained it to themselves. As to the purposes of the Union, therefore, Georgia is NOT a sovereign State. If the Judicial decision of this case forms one of those purposes; the allegation, that Georgia is a sovereign Stat, is unsupported by the fact. Whether the judicial decision of this cause is, or is not, one of those purposes, is a question which will be examined particularly in a subsequent part of my argument.</p>
<p>There is a third sense, in which the term sovereign is frequently used, and which it is very material to trace and explain, as it furnishes a basis for what I presume to be one of the principal objections against the jurisdiction of this Court over the State of Georgia. In this sense, sovereignty is derived from a feudal source; and like many other parts of that system so degrading to man, still retains its influence over our sentiments and conduct, though the cause, by which that influence was produced, never extended to the American States. The accurate and well informed President Henault, in his excellent chronological abridgment of the History of France, tells us, that, about the end of the second race of Kings, a new kind of possession was acquired, under the name of Fief. The Governors of Cities and Provinces usurped equally the property of land, <span class="star-pagination">*458</span> and the administration of justice; and established themselves as proprietary Seigniors over those places, in which they had been only civil magistrates or military officers. By this means, there was introduced into the State a new kind of authority, to which was assigned the appellation of sovereignty<sup>[*]</sup>. In process of time the feudal system was extended over France, and almost all the other nations of Europe: And every Kingdom became, in fact, a large fief. Into England this system was introduced by the conqueror: and to this Ã¦ra we may, probably, refer the English maxim, that the King or sovereign is the fountain of Justice. But, in the case of the King, the sovereignty had a double operation. While it vested him with jurisdiction over others, it excluded all others from jurisdiction over him. With regard to him, there was no superior power; and, consequently, on feudal principles, no right of jurisdiction. "<sup>[Â†]</sup> The law, says Sir William Blackstone, ascribes to the King the attribute of sovereignty: he is sovereign and independent within his own dominions; and owes no kind of objection to any other potentate upon earth. Hence it is, that no suit or action can be brought against the King, even in civil matters; because no Court can have jurisdiction over him: for all jurisdiction implies superiority of power." This last position is only a branch of a much more extensive principle, on which a plan of systematic despotism has been lately formed in England, and prosecuted with unwearied assiduity and care. Of this plan the author of the Commentaries was, if not the introducer, at least the great supporter. He has been followed in it by writers later and less known; and his doctrines have, both on the other and this fide of the Atlantic, been implicitly and generally received by those, who neither examined their principles nor their consequences, The principle is, that all human law must be prescribed by a superior. This principle I mean not now to examine. Suffice it, at present to say, that another principle, very different in its nature and operations, forms, in my judgment, the basis of found and genuine jurisprudence; laws derived from the pure source of equality and justice must be founded on the CONSENT of those, whose obedience they require. The sovereign, when traced to his source, must be found in the man.</p>
<p>I have now fixed, in the scale of things, the grade of a State; and have described its composure: I have considered the nature of sovereignty; and pointed its application to the proper object. I have examined the question before us, by the principles of general jurisprudence. In those principles I find nothing, which tends to evince an exemption of the State of Georgia, from the jurisdiction of the Court. I find every thing to have a contrary tendency.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*459</span> II. I am, in the second place, to examine this question by the laws and practice of different States and Kingdoms. In ancient Greece, as we learn from Isocrates, whole nations defended their rights before crouded tribunals. Such occasions as these excited, we are told, all the powers of persuasion; and the vehemence and enthusiasm of the sentiment was gradually infused into the Grecian language, equally susceptible of strength and harmony. In those days, law, liberty, and refining science, made their benign progress in strict and graceful union: The rude and degrading league between the bar and feudal barbarism was not yet formed.</p>
<p>When the laws and practice of particular States have any application to the question before us; that application will furnish what is called an argument a fortiori; because all the instances produced will be instances of subjects instituting and supporting suits against those, who were deemed their own sovereigns. These instances are stronger than the present one; because between the present plaintiff and defendant no such unequal relation is alledged to exist.</p>
<p>Columbus atchieved the discovery of that country, which, perhaps, ought to bear his name. A contract made by Columbus furnished the first precedent for supporting, in his discovered country, the cause of injured merit against the claims and pretentions of haughty and ungrateful power. His son Don Diego wasted two years in incessant, but fruitless, solicitation at the Court of Spain, for the rights which descended to him in consequence of his father's original capitulation. He endeavoured, at length, to obtain, by a legal sentence, what he could not procure from the favour of an interested Monarch. He commenced a suit against Ferdinand before the Council, which managed Indian affairs; and that Court, with integrity which reflects honour on their proceedings, decided against the King, and sustained Don Diego's claim.<sup>[*]</sup></p>
<p>Other States have instituted officers to judge the proceedings of their Kings: Of this kind were the Ephori of Sparta: of this kind also was the mayor of the Palace, and afterwards the constable of France.<sup>[Â†]</sup></p>
<p>But of all the laws and institutions relating to the present question, none is so striking as that described by the famous Hottoman, in his book entitled Francogallia. When the Spaniards of Arragon elect a King, they represent a kind of play, and introduce a personage, whom they dignify by the name of LAW, la Justiza, of Arragon. This personage they declare, by a public decree, to be greater and more powerful than their King; and then address him in the following remarkable expressions. "We, who are of as great worth as you, and can do more <span class="star-pagination">*460</span> than you can do, elect you to be our King, upon the conditions stipulated: But between you and us there is one of greater authority than you."<sup>[*]</sup></p>
<p>In England, according to Sir William Blackstone, no suit can be brought against the King, even in civil matters. So, in that Kingdom, is the law, at this time, received. But it was not always so. Under the Saxon Government, a very different doctrine was held to be orthodox. Under that Government, as we are informed by the Mirror of Justice, a book said, by Sir Edward Coke, to have been written, in part, at least, before the conquest; under that Government it was ordained, that the King's Court should be open to all Plaintiffs, by which, without delay, they should have remedial writs, as well against the King or against the Queen, as against any other of the people.<sup>[Â†]</sup> The law continued to be the same for some centuries after the conquest. Until the time of Edward I. the King might have been sued as a common person. The form of the process was even imperative. "PrÃ¦cipe Henrico Regi AngliÃ¦" &amp;c. "Command Henry King of England" &amp;c.<sup>[Â‡]</sup> Bractan, who wrote in the time of Henry III. uses these very remarkable expressions concerning the King "in justitia recipienda, minimo de regno suo comparetur" Â— "in receiving justice, he should be placed on a level with the meanest person in the Kingdom<sup>[Â§]</sup>." True it is, that now in England the King must be sued in his Courts by Petition; but even now, the difference is only in the form, not in the thing. The judgments or decrees of those Courts will substantially be the same upon a precatory as upon a mandatory process. In the Courts of Justice, says the very able author of the considerations on the laws of forfeiture, the King enjoys many privileges; yet not to deter the subject from contending with him freely<sup>[Â†]</sup>. The Judge of the High Court of Admiralty in England made, in a very late cause, the following manly and independent declaration. "In any case, where the Crown is a party, it is to be observed, that the Crown can no more withhold evidence of documents in its possession, than a private person. If the Court thinks proper to order the production of any public instrument; that order must be obeyed. It wants no Insignia of an authority derived from the Crown<sup>[Â¶]</sup>."</p>
<p>"Judges ought to know, that the poorest peasant is a man as well as the King himself; all men ought to obtain justice; since in the estimation of justice, all men are equal; whether the Prince complain of a peasant, or a peasant complain of the Prince."<sup>[*]</sup> These are the words of a King, of the late Frederic of Prussia. In his Courts of Justice, that great man stood <span class="star-pagination">*461</span> upon his native greatness; and disdained to mount upon the artificial stilts of sovereignty.</p>
<p>Thus much concerning the laws and practice of other States and Kingdoms. We see nothing against, but much in favour of, the jurisdiction of this Court over the State of Georgia, a party to this cause.</p>
<p>III. I am, thirdly, and chiefly, to examine the important question now before us, by the Constitution of the United States, and the legitimate result of that valuable instrument. Under this view, the question is naturally subdivided into two others. 1. Could the Constitution of the United States vest a jurisdiction over the State of Georgia? 2. Has that Constitution vested such jurisdiction in this Court? I have already remarked, that in the practice, and even in the science of politics, there has been frequently a strong current against the natural order of things; and an inconsiderate or an interested disposition to sacrifice the end to the means. This remark deserves a more particular illustration. Even in almost every nation, which has been denominated free, the state has assumed a supercilious pre-eminence above the people, who have formed it: Hence the haughty notions of state independence, state sovereignty and state supremacy. In despotic Governments, the Government has usurped, in a similar manner, both upon the state and the people: Hence all arbitrary doctrines and pretensions concerning the Supreme, absolute, and incontrolable, power of Government. In each, man is degraded from the prime rank, which he ought to hold in human affairs: In the latter, the state as well as the man is degraded. Of both degradations, striking instances occur in history, in politics, and in common life. One of them is drawn from an anecdote, which is recorded concerning Louis XIV. who has been stiled the grand Monarch of France. This Prince, who diffused around him so much dazzling splendour, and so little vivifying heat, was vitiated by that inverted manner of teaching and of thinking, which forms Kings to be tyrants, without knowing or even suspecting that they are so. The oppression, under which he held his subjects during the whole course of his long reign, proceeded chiefly from the principles and habits of his erroneous education. By these, he had been accustomed to consider his Kingdom as his patrimony, and his power over his subjects as his rightful and undelegated inheritance. These sentiments were so deeply and strongly imprinted on his mind, that when one of his Ministers represented to him the miserable condition, to which those subjects were reduced, and, in the course of his representation, frequently used the word L'Etat, the state, the King, though he felt the truth and approved the substance of all that was said, yet was shocked at the frequent repetition of the expression L'Etat; and <span class="star-pagination">*462</span> complained of it it as an indecency offered to his person and character. And, indeed, that Kings should imagine themselves the final causes, for which men were made, and societies were formed and Governments were instituted, will cease to be a matter of wonder or surprise, when we find that lawyers, and statesmen, and philosophers, have taught or favoured principles, which necessarily lead to the same conclusion. Another instance, equally strong, but still more astonishing, is drawn from the British Government, as described by Sir William Blackstone and his followers. As described by him and them, the British is a despotic Government. It is a Government without a people. In that Government, as so described, the sovereignty is possessed by the Parliament: In the Parliament, therefore, the supreme and absolute authority is vested:<sup>[*]</sup> In the Parliament resides that incontrolable and despotic power, which, in all Governments, must reside somewhere. The constituent parts of the Parliament are the King's Majesty, the Lord's Spiritual, the Lord's Temporal, and the Commons. The King and there three Estates together form the great corporation or body politic of the Kingdom. All these sentiments are found; the last expressions are found verbatim<sup>[Â†]</sup> in the commentaries upon the laws of England.<sup>[Â†]</sup> The Parliament form the great body politic of England! What, then, or where, are the PEOPLE? Nothing! No where! They are not so much as even the "baseless fabric of a vision!" From legal contemplation they totally disappear! Am I not warranted in saying, that, if this is a just description; a Government, so and justly so described, is a despotic Government? Whether this description is or is not a just one, is a question of very different import.</p>
<p>In the United States, and in the several States, which compose the Union, we go not so far: but still we go one step farther than we ought to go in this unnatural and inverted order of things. The states, rather than the PEOPLE, for whose sakes the States exist, are frequently the objects which attract and arrest car principal attention. This, I believe, has produced much of the confusion and perplexity, which have appeared in several proceedings and several publications on state-politics, and on the politics, too, of the United States. Sentiments and expressions of this inaccurate kind prevail in our common, even in our convivial, language. Is a toast asked? "The United States," instead of the "People of the United States," is the toast given. This is not politically correct. The toast is meant to present to view the first great object in the Union: It presents only the second: It presents only the artificial person, instead of the natural persons, who spoke it into existence. A State I cheerfully <span class="star-pagination">*463</span> admit, is the noblest work of Man: But, Man himself, free and honest, is, I speak as to this would, the noblest work of GOD.</p>
<p>Concerning the prerogative of Kings, and concerning the sovereignty of States, much has been said and written; but little has been said and written concerning a subject much more dignified and important, the majesty of the people. The mode of expression, which I would substitute in the place of that generally used, is not only politically, but also (for between true liberty and true taste there is a close alliance) classically more correct. On the mention of Athens, a thousand refined and endearing associations rush at once into the memory of the scholar, the philosopher, and the patriot. When Homer, one of the most correct as well as the oldest of human authorities, enumerates the other nations of Greece, whose forces acted at the fiege of Troy, he arranges them under the names of their different Kings or Princes: But when he comes to the Athenians, he distinguishes them by the peculiar appellation of the PEOPLE<sup>[*]</sup> of Athens. The well known address used by Demosthenes, when he harrangued and animated his assembled countrymen, was "O Men of Athens." With the strictest propriety, therefore, classical and political, our national scene opens with the most magnificent object, which the nation could present. "The PEOPLE of the United States" are the first personages introduced. Who were those people? They were the citizens of thirteen States, each of which had a separate Constitution and Government, and all of which were connected together by articles of consederation. To the purposes of public strength and felicity, that confederacy was totally inadequate. A requisition on the several States terminated its Legislative authority: Executive or Judicial authority it had none. In order, therefore, to form a more perfect union, to establish justice, to ensure domestic tranquillity, to provide for common defence, and to secure the blessings of liberty, those people, among whom were the people of Georgia, ordained and established the present Constitution. By that Constitution Legislative power is vested, Executive power is vested, Judicial power is vested.</p>
<p>The question now opens fairly to our view, could the people of those States, among whom were those of Georgia, bind those States, and Georgia among the others, by the Legislative, Executive, and Judicial power to vested? If the principles, on which I have founded myself, are just and true; this question must unavoidably receive an affirmative answer. If those States were the work of those people; those people, and, that I may apply the case closely, the people of Georgia, in particular, <span class="star-pagination">*464</span> could alter, as they pleased, their former work: To any given degree, they could diminish as well as enlarge it. Any or all of the former State-powers, they could extinguish or transfer. The inference, which necessarily results, is, that the Constitution ordained and established by those people; and, still closely to apply the case, in particular by the people of Georgia, could vest jurisdiction or judicial power over those States and over the State of Georgia in particular.</p>
<p>The next question under this head, is, Â— Has the Constitution done so? Did those people mean to exercise this, their undoubted power? These questions may be resolved, either by fair and conclusive deductions, or by direct and explicit declarations. In order, ultimately, to discover, whether the people of the United States intended to bind those States by the Judicial power vested by the national Constitution, a previous enquiry will naturally be: Did those people intend to bind those states by the Legislative power vested by that Constitution? The articles of confederation, it is well known, did not operate upon individual citizens; but operated only upon states, This defect was remedied by the national Constitution, which, as all allow, has an operation on individual citizens. But if an opinion, which some seem to entertain, be just; the defect remedied, on one side, was balanced by a defect introduced on the other: For they seem to think, that the present Constitution operates only on individual citizens, and not on States. This opinion, however, appears to be altogether unfounded. When certain laws of the States are declared to be "subject to the revision and control of the Congress;"<sup>[*]</sup> it cannot, surely, be contended that the Legislative power of the national Government was meant to have no operation on the several States. The fact, uncontrovertibly established in one instance, proves the principle in all other instances, to which the facts will be found to apply. We may then infer, that the people of the United States intended to bind the several States, by the Legislative power of the national Government.</p>
<p>In order to make the discovery, at which we ultimately aim, a second previous enquiry will naturally be Â— Did the people of the United States intend to bind the several States by the Executive power of the national Government? The affirmative answer to the former question directs, unavoidably, an affirmative answer to this. Ever since the time of Bracton, his maxim, I believe, has been deemed a good one Â— "Supervacuum esset leges condere, nisi esset qui leges tueretur."<sup>[Â†]</sup> "It would be superfluous to make laws, unless those laws, when made, were to be enforced." When the laws are plain, and the application of them is uncontroverted, they are enforced immediately by the <span class="star-pagination">*465</span> Executive authority of Government. When the application of them is doubtful or intricate, the interposition of the judicial authority becomes necessary. The same principle, therefore, which directed us from the first to the second step, will direct us from the second to the third and last step of our deduction. Fair and conclusive deduction, then, evinces that the people of the United States did vest this Court with jurisdiction over the State of Georgia. The same truth may be deduced from the declared objects, and the general texture of the Constitution of the United States. One of its declared objects is, to form an union more perfect, than, before that time, had been formed. Before that time, the Union possessed Legislative, but uninforced Legislative power over the States. Nothing could be more natural than to intend that this Legislative power should be enforced by powers Executive and Judicial. Another declared object is, "to establish justice." This points, in a particular manner, to the Judicial authority. And when we view this object in conjunction with the declaration, "that no State shall pass a law impairing the obligation of contracts;" we shall probably think, that this object points, in a particular manner, to the jurisdiction of the Court over the several States. What good purpose could this Constitutional provision secure, if a State might pass a law impairing the obligation of its own contracts; and be amenable, for such a violation of right, to no controuling judiciary power? We have seen, that on the principles of general jurisprudence, a State, for the breach of a contract, may be liable for damages. A third declared object is Â— "to ensure domestic tranquillity." This tranquillity is most likely to be disturbed by controversies between States. These consequences will be most peaceably and effectually decided by the establishment and by the exercise of a superintending judicial authority. By such exercise and establishment, the law of nations; the rule between contending States; will be enforced among the several States, in the same manner as municipal law.</p>
<p>Whoever considers, in a combined and comprehensive view, the general texture of the Constitution, will be satisfied, that the people of the United States intended to form themselves into a nation for national purposes. They instituted, for such purposes, a national Government, complete in all its parts, with powers Legislative, Executive and Judiciary; and, in all those powers, extending over the whole nation. Is it congruous, that, with regard to such purposes, any man or body of men, any person natural or artificial, should be permitted to claim successfully an entire exemption from the jurisdiction of the national Government? Would not such claims, crowned with success, be repugnant to our very existence as a nation? When <span class="star-pagination">*466</span> so many trains of deduction, coming from different quarters, converge and unite, at last, in the same point; we may safely conclude, as the legitimate result of this Constitution, that the State of Georgia is amenable to the jurisdiction of this Court.</p>
<p>But, in my opinion, this doctrine rests not upon the legitimate result of fair and conclusive deduction from the Constitution: It is confirmed, beyond all doubt, by the direct and explicit declaration of the Constitution itself. "The judicial power of the United States shall extend, to controversies between two States."<sup>[*]</sup> Two States are supposed to have a controversy between them: This controversy is supposed to be brought before those vested with the judicial power of the United States: Can the most consummate degree of professional ingenuity devise a mode by which this "controversy between two States" can be brought before a Court of law; and yet neither of those States be a Defendant? "The judicial power of the United States shall extend to controversies, between a state and citizens of another State." Could the strictest legal language; could even that language, which is peculiarly appropriated to an art, deemed, by a great master, to be one of the most honorable, laudable, and profitable things in our law; could this strict and appropriated language, describe, with more precise accuracy, the cause now depending before the tribunal? Causes, and not parties to causes, are weighed by justice, in her equal scales: On the former solely, her attention is fixed: To the latter, she is, as she is painted, blind.</p>
<p>I have now tried this question by all the touchstones, to which I proposed to apply it. I have examined it by the principles of general jurisprudence; by the laws and practice of States and Kingdoms; and by the Constitution of the United States. From all, the combined inference is; that the action lies.</p>
<p>CUSHIHG, Justice.</p>
<p>The grand and principal question in this case is, whether a State can, by the FÂœderal Constitution, be sued by an individual citizen of another State?</p>
<p>The point turns not upon the law or practice of England, although perhaps it may be in some measure elucidated thereby, nor upon the law of any other country whatever; but upon the Constitution established by the people of the United States; and particularly upon the extent of powers given to the FÂœderal Judicial in the 2d section of the 3d article of the Constitution. It is declared that "the Judicial power shall extend to all cases in law and equity arising under the Constitution, the laws of the United States, or treaties made or which shall be made under their authority; to all cases affecting ambassadors or other public ministers and consuls; to all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction; to controversies, to which the United <span class="star-pagination">*467</span> States shall be a party; to controversies between two or more States and citizens of another State; between citizens of different States; between citizens of the same State claiming lands under grants of different States; and between a State and citizens thereof and foreign States, citizens or subjects." The judicial power, then, is expressly extended to "controversies between a State and citizens of another State." When a citizen makes a demand against a State, of which he is not a citizen, it is as really a controversy between a State and a citizen of another State, as if such State made a demand against such citizen. The case, then, seems clearly to fall within the letter of the Constitution. It may be suggested that it could not be intended to subject a State to be a Defendant, because it would effect the sovereignty of States. If that be the case, what shall we do with the immediate preceding clause; "controversies between two or more States," where a State must of necessity be Defendant? If it was not the intent, in the very next clause also, that a State might be made Defendant, why was it so expressed as naturally to lead to and comprehend that idea? Why was not an exception made if one was intended?</p>
<p>Again Â— what are we to do with the last clause of the section of judicial powers, viz. "Controversies between a state, or the citizens thereof, and foreign states or citizens?" Here again, States must be suable or liable to be made Defendants by this clause, which has a similar mode of language with the two other clauses I have remarked upon. For if the judicial power extends to a controversy between one of the United States and a foreign State, as the clause expresses, one of them must be Defendant. And then, what becomes of the sovereignty of States as far as suing affects it? But although the words appear reciprocally to affect the State here and a foreign State, and put them on the same footing as far as may be, yet ingenuity may say, that the State here may sue, but cannot be sued; but that the foreign State may be sued but cannot sue. We may touch foreign sovereignties but not our own. But I conceive the reason of the thing, as well as the words of the Constitution, tend to show that the FÂœderal Judicial power extends to a suit brought by a foreign State against any one of the United States. ONE design of the general Government was for managing the great affairs of peace and war and the general defence, which were impossible to be conducted, with safety, by the States separately. Incident to these powers, and for preventing controversies between foreign powers or citizens from rising to extremeties and to an appeal to the sword, a national tribunal was necessary, amicably to decide them, and thus ward off such fatal, public calamity. Thus, States at home and their citizens, and foreign States and their citizens, are put together without <span class="star-pagination">*468</span> distinction upon the same footing, as far as may be, as to controversies between them. So also, with respect to controversies between a State and citizens of another State (at home) comparing all the clauses together, the remedy is reciprocal; the claim to justice equal. As controversies between State and State, and between a State and citizens of another State, might tend gradually to involve States in war and bloodshed, a disinterested civil tribunal was intended to be instituted to decide such controversies, and preserve peace and friendship. Further; if a State is entitled to Justice in the FÂœderal Court, against a citizen of another State, why not such citizen against the State, when the same language equally comprehends both? The rights of individuals and the justice due to them, are as dear and precious as those of States. Indeed the latter are founded upon the former; and the great end and object of them must be to secure and support the rights of individuals, or else vain is Government.</p>
<p>But still it may be insisted, that this will reduce States to mere corporations, and take away all sovereignty. As to corporations, all States whatever are corporations or bodies politic. The only question is, what are their powers? As to individual States and the United States, the Constitution marks the boundary of powers. Whatever power is deposited with the Union by the people for their own necessary security, is so far a curtailing of the power and prerogatives of States. This is, as it were, a self-evident proposition; at least it cannot be contested. Thus the power of declaring war, making peace, raising and supporting armies for public defence, levying duties, excises and taxes, if necessary, with many other powers, are lodged in Congress; and are a most essential abridgement of State sovereignty. Again; the restrictions upon States; "No State shall enter into any treaty, alliance, or confederation, coin money, emit bills of credit, make any thing but gold and silver a tender in payment of debts, pass any law impairing the obligation of contracts;" these, with a number of others, are important restrictions of the power of States, and were thought necessary to maintain the Union; and to establish some fundamental uniform principles of public justice, throughout the whole Union. So that, I think, no argument of force can be taken from the sovereignty of States. Where it has been abridged, it was thought necessary for the greater indispensable good of the whole. If the Constitution is found inconvenient in practice in this or any other particular, it is well that a regular mode is pointed out for amendment. But, while it remains, all offices Legislative, Executive, and Judicial, both of the States and of the Union, are bound by oath to support it.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*469</span> One other objection has been suggested, that if a State may be sued by a citizen of another State, then the United States may be sued by a citizen of any of the States, or, in other words, by any of their citizens. If this be a necessary consequence, it must be so. I doubt the consequence, from the different wording of the different clauses, connected with other reasons. When speaking of the United States, the Constitution says "controversies to which the UNITED STATES shall be a party" not controversies between the United States and any of their citizens. When speaking of States, it says, "controversies between two or more states; between a state and citizens of another state." As to reasons for citizens suing a different State, which do not hold equally good for suing the United States; one may be, that as controversies between a State and citizens of another State, might have a tendency to involve both States in contest, and perhaps in war, a common umpire to decide such controversies, may have a tendency to prevent the mischief. That an object of this kind was had in view by the framers of the Constitution, I have no doubt, when I consider the clashing interfering laws which were made in the neighbouring States, before the adoption of the Constitution, and some affecting the property of citizens of another State in a very different manner from that of their own citizens. But I do not think it necessary to enter fully into the question, whether the United States are liable to be sued by an individual citizen? In order to decide the point before us. Upon the whole, I am of opinion, that the Constitution warrants a suit again a State, by an individual citizen of another State.</p>
<p>A second question made in the case was, whether the particular action of assumpsit could lie against a State? I think assumpsit will lie, if any suit; provided a State is capable of contracting.</p>
<p>The third question respects the competency of service, which I apprehend is good and proper; the service being by summons and notifying the suit to the Governor and the Attorney General; the Governor, who is the Supreme Executive Magistrate and representative of the State, who is bound by oath to defend the State, and by the Constitution to give information to the Legislature of all important matters which concern the interest of the State; the Attorney General who is bound to defend the interest of the State in Courts of Law.</p>
<p>JAY, Chief Justice.</p>
<p>The question we are now to decide has been accurately stated, viz. Is a State suable by individual citizens of another State?</p>
<p>It is said, that Georgia refuses to appear and answer to the Plaintiff in this action, because she is a sovereign State, and therefore not liable to such actions. In order to ascertain the merits <span class="star-pagination">*470</span> of this objection, let us enquire, 1st. In what sense Georgia is a sovereign State. 2d. Whether suability is incompatable with such sovereignty. 3d. Whether the Constitution (to which Georgia is a party) authorises such an action against her.</p>
<p>Suability and suable are words not in common use, but they concisely and correctly convey the idea annexed to them.</p>
<p>1st. In determining the sense in which Georgia is a sovereign State, it may be useful to turn our attention to the political situation we were in, prior to the Revolution, and to the political rights which emerged from the Revolution. All the country now possessed by the United States was then a part of the dominions appertaining to the crown of Great Britain. Every acre of land in this country was then held mediately or immediately by grants from that crown. All the people of this country were then, subjects of the King of Great Britain, and owed allegiance to him; and all the civil authority then existing or exercised here, flowed from the head of the British Empire. They were in strict sense fellow subjects, and in a variety of respects one people. When the Revolution commenced, the patriots did not assert that only the same affinity and social connection subsisted between the people, of the colonies, which subsisted between the people of Gaul, Britain, and Spain, while Roman Provinces, viz. only that affinity and social connection which result from the mere circumstance of being governed by the same Prince; different ideas prevailed, and gave occasion to the Congress of 1774 and 1775.</p>
<p>The Revolution, or rather the Declaration of Independence, found the people already united for general purposes, and at the same time providing for their more domestic concerns by State conventions, and other temporary arrangements. From the crown of Great Britain, the sovereignty of their country passed to the people of it; and it was then not an uncommon opinion, that the unappropriated lands, which belonged to that crown, passed not to the people of the Colony or States within whose limits they were situated, but to the whole people; on whatever principles this opinion rested, it did not give way to the other, and thirteen sovereignties were considered as emerged from the principles of the Revolution, combined with local convenience and considerations; the people nevertheless continued to consider themselves, in a national point of view, as one people; and they continued without interruption to manage their national concerns accordingly; afterwards, in the hurry of the war, and in the warmth of mutual confidence, they made a confederation of the States, the basis of a general Government. Experience disappointed the expectations they had formed from it; and then the people, in their collective and national capacity, established the present Constitution. It is remarkable <span class="star-pagination">*471</span> that in establishing it, the people exercised their own rights, and their own proper sovereignty, and conscious of the plenitude of it, they declared with becoming dignity, "We "the people of the United States, do ordain and establish this "Constitution." Here we fee the people acting as sovereigns of the whole country; and in the language of sovereignty, establishing a Constitution by which it was their will, that the State Governments should be bound, and to which the State Constitutions should be made to conform. Every State Constitution is a compact made by and between the citizens of a State to govern themselves in a certain manner; and the Constitution of the United States is likewise a compact made by the people of the United States to govern themselves as to general objects, in a certain manner. By this great compact however, many prerogatives were transferred to the national Government, such as those of making war and peace, contracting alliances, coining money, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
<p>If then it be true, that the sovereignty of the nation is in the people of the nation, and the residuary sovereinty of each State in the people of each State, it may be useful to compare these sovereignties with those in Europe, that we may thence be enabled to judge, whether all the prerogatives which are allowed to the latter, are so essential to the former. There is reason to suspect that some of the difficulties which embarrass the present question, arise from inattention to differences which subsist between them.</p>
<p>It will be sufficient to observe briefly, that the sovereignties in Europe, and particularly in England, exist on feudal principles. That system considers the Prince as the sovereign, and the people as his subjects; it regards his person as the object of allegiance, and excludes the idea of his being on an equal footing with a subject, either in a Court of Justice or elsewhere. That system contemplates him as being the fountain of honor and authority; and from his grace and grant derives all franchises, immunities and privileges; it is easy to perceive that such a sovereign could not be amenable to a Court of Justice, or subjected to judicial controul and actual constraint. It was of necessity, therefore, that suability became incompatible with such sovereignty. Besides, the Prince having all the Executive powers, the judgment of the Courts would, in fact, be only monitory, not mandatory to him, and a capacity to be advised, is a distinct thing from a capacity to be sued. The same feudal ideas run through all their jurisprudence, and constantly remind us of the distinction between the Prince and the subject. No such ideas obtain here; at the Revolution, the sovereignty devolved on the people; and they are truly the sovereigns of the country, but they are sovereigns without subjects (unless the African <span class="star-pagination">*472</span> slaves among us may be so called) and have none to govern but themselves; the citizens of America are equal as fellow citizens, and as joint tenants in the sovereignty.</p>
<p>From the differences existing between feudal sovereignties and Governments founded on compacts, it necessarily follows that their respective prerogatives must differ. Soverignty is the right to govern; a nation or State-sovereign is the person or persons in whom that resides. In Europe the sovereignty is generally ascribed to the Prince; here it rests with the people; there, the sovereign actually administers the Government; here, never in a single instance; our Governors are the agents of the people, and at most stand in the same relation to their sovereign, in which regents in Europe stand to their sovereigns. Their Princes have personal powers, dignities, and pre-eminences, our rulers have none but official; nor do they partake in the sovereignty otherwise, or in any other capacity, than as private citizens.</p>
<p>2d. The second object of enquiry now presents itself, viz. whether suability is compatible with State sovereignty.</p>
<p>Suability, by whom? Not a subject, for in this country there are none; not an inferior, for all the citizens being as to civil rights perfectly equal, there is not, in that respect, one citizen inferior to another. It is agreed, that one free citizen may sue another; the obvious dictates of justice, and the purposes of society demanding it. It is agreed, that one free citizen may sue any number on whom process can be conveniently executed; nay, in certain cases one citizen may sue forty thousand; for where a corporation is sued, all the members of sand; for where a corporation is sued, all the members of it are actually sued, though not personally, sued. In this city there are forty odd thousand free citizens, all of whom may be collectively sued by any individual citizen. In the State of Delaware, there are fifty odd thousand free citizens, and what reason can be assigned why a free citizen who has demands against them should not prosecute them? Can the difference between forty odd thousand, and fifty odd thousand make any distinction as to right? Is it not as easy, and as convenient to the public and parties, to serve a summons on the Governor and Attorney General of Delaware, as on the Mayor or other Officers of the Corporation of Philadelphia? Will it be said, that the fifty odd thousand citizens in Delaware being associated under a State Government, stand in a rank so superior to the forty odd thousand of Philadelphia, associated under their charter, that although it may become the latter to meet an individual on an equal footing in a Court of Justice, yet that such a procedure would not comport with the dignity of the former? Â— In this land of equal liberty, shall forty odd thousand in one place be compellable to do justice, and yet fifty odd thousand in <span class="star-pagination">*473</span> another place be privileged to do justice only as they may think proper? Such objections would not correspond with the equal rights we claim; with the equality we profess to admire and maintain, and with that popular sovereignty in which every citizen partakes. Grant that the Governor of Delaware holds an office of superior rank to the Mayor of Philadelphia, they are both nevertheless the officers of the people; and however more exalted the one may be than the other, yet in the opinion of those who dislike aristocracy, that circumstance cannot be a good reason for impeding the course of justice.</p>
<p>If there be any such incompatability as is pretended, whence does it arise? In what does it consist? There is at least one strong undeniable fact against this incompatibility, and that is this, any one State in the Union may sue another State, in this Court, that is, all the people of one State may sue all the people of another State. It is plain then, that a State may be sued, and hence it plainly follows, that suability and state sovereignty are not incompatible. As one State may sue another State in this Court, it is plain that no degradation to a State is thought to accompany her appearance in this Court. It is not therefore to an appearance in this Court that the objection points. To what does it point? It points to an appearance at the suit of one or more citizens. But why it should be more incompatible, that all the people of a State should be sued by one citizen, than by one hundred thousand, I cannot perceive, the process in both cases being alike; and the consequences of a judgment alike. Nor can I observe any greater inconveniencies in the one case than in the other, except what may arise from the feelings of those who may regard a lesser number in an inferior light. But if any reliance be made on this inferiority as an objection, at least one half of its force is done away by this fact, viz. that it is conceded that a State may appear in this Court as Plaintiff against a single citizen as Defendant; and the truth is, that the State of Georgia is at this moment prosecuting an action in this Court against two citizens of South Carolina.<sup>[*]</sup></p>
<p>The only remnant of objection therefore that remains is, that the State is not bound to appear and answer as a Defendant at the suit of an individual: but why it is unreasonable that she should be so bound, is hard to conjecture: That rule is said to be a bad one, which does not work both ways; the citizens of Georgia are content with a right of suing citizens of other States; but are not content that citizens of other States should have a right to sue them.</p>
<p>Let us now proceed to enquire whether Georgia has not, by being a party to the national compact, consented to be suable by individual citizens of another State. This enquiry naturally <span class="star-pagination">*474</span> leads our attention, 1st. To the design of the Constitution. 2d. To the letter and express declaration in it.</p>
<p>Prior to the date of the Constitution, the people had not any national tribunal to which they could resort for justice; the distribution of justice was then confined to State judicatories, in whose institution and organization the people of the other States had no participation, and over whom they had not the least controul. There was then no general Court of appellate jurisdiction, by whom the errors of State Courts, affecting either the nation at large or the citizens of any other State, could be revised and corrected. Each State was obliged to acquiesce in the measure of justice which another State might yield to her, or to her citizens; and that even in cases where State considerations were not always favorable to the most exact measure. There was danger that from this source animosities would in time result; and as the transition from animosities to hostilities was frequent in the history of independent States, a common tribunal for the termination of controversies became desirable, from motives both of justice and of policy.</p>
<p>Prior also to that period, the United States had, by taking a place among the nations of the earth, become amenable to the laws of nations; and it was their interest as well as their duty to provide, that those laws should be respected and obeyed; in their national character and capacity, the United States were responsible to foreign nations for the conduct of each State, relative to the laws of nations, and the performance of treaties; and there the inexpediency of referring all such questions to State Courts, and particularly to the Courts of delinquent States became apparent. While all the States were bound to protect each, and the citizens of each, it was highly proper and reasonable, that they should be in a capacity, not only to cause justice to be done to each, and the citizens of each; but also to cause justice to be done by each, and the citizens of each; and that, not by violence and force, but in a stable, sedate, and regular course of judicial procedure.</p>
<p>These were among the evils against which it was proper for the nation, that is, the people of all the United States, to provide by a national judiciary, to be instituted by the whole nation, and to be responsible to the whole nation.</p>
<p>Let us now turn to the Constitution. The people therein declare, that their design in establishing it, comprehended six objects. 1st. To form a more perfect union. 2d. To establish justice. 3d. To ensure domestic tranquillity. 4th. To provide for the common defence. 5th. To promote the general welfare. 6th. To secure the blessings of liberty to themselves and their posterity. It would be pleasing and useful to consider and trace the relations which each of these objects bears to the others; <span class="star-pagination">*475</span> and to shew that they collectively comprise every thing requisite, with the blessing of Divine Providence, to render a people prosperous and happy: on the present occasion such disquisitions would be unreasonable, because foreign to the subject immediately under consideration.</p>
<p>It may be asked, what is the precise sense and latitude in which the words "to establish justice," as here used, are to be understood? The answer to this question will result from the provisions made in the Constitution on this head. They are specified in the 2d. section of the 3d article, where it is ordained, that the judicial power of the United States shall extend to ten descriptions of cases, viz. 1st. To all cases arising under this Constitution; because the meaning, construction, and operation of a compact ought always to be ascertained by all the parties, or by authority derived only from one of them. 2d. To all cases arising under the laws of the United States; because as such laws constitutionally made, are obligatory on each State, the measure of obligation and obedience ought not to be decided and fixed by the party from whom they are due, but by a tribunal deriving authority from both the parties. 3d. To all cases arising under treaties made by their authority; because, as treaties are compacts made by, and obligatory on, the whole nation, their operation ought not to be affected or regulated by the local laws or Courts of a part of the nation. 4th. To all cases affecting Ambassadors, or other public Ministers and Consuls; because, as these are officers of foreign nations, whom this nation are bound to protect and treat according to the laws of nations, cases affecting them ought only to be cognizable by national authority. 5th. To all cases of Admiralty and Maritime jurisdiction; because, as the seas are the joint property of nations, whose right and privileges relative thereto, are regulated by the law of nations and treaties, such cases necessarily belong to national jurisdiction. 6th. To controversies to which the United States shall be a party; because in cases in which the whole people are interested, it would not be equal or wife to let any one State decide and measure out the justice due to others. 7th. To controversies between two or more States; because domestic tranquillity requires, that the contentions of States should be peaceably terminated by a common judicatory; and, because, in a free country justice ought not to depend on the will of either of the litigants. 8th. To controversies between a State and citizens of another State; because in case a State (that is all the citizens of it) has demands against some citizens of another State, it is better that she should prosecute their demands in a national Court, than in a Court of the State to which those citizens belong; the danger of irritation and criminations arising from apprehensions and <span class="star-pagination">*476</span> suspicions of partiality, being thereby obviated. Because, in cases where some citizens of one State have demands against all the citizens of another State, the cause of liberty and the rights of men forbid, that the latter should be the sole Judges of the justice due to the latter; and true Republican Government requires that free and equal citizens should have free, fair, and equal justice. 9th. To controversies between citizens of the same State, claiming lands under grants of different States; because, as the rights of the two States to grant the land, are drawn into question, neither of the two States ought to decide the controversy. 10th. To controversies between a State, or the citizens thereof; and foreign States, citizens or subjects; because, as every nation is responsible for the conduct of its citizens towards other nations; all questions touching the justice due to foreign nations, or people, ought to be ascertained by, and depend on national authority. Even this cursory view of the judicial powers of the United States, leaves the mind strongly impressed with the importance of them to the preservation of the tranquillity, the equal sovereignty, and the equal right of the people.</p>
<p>The question now before us renders it necessary to pay particular attention to that part of the 2d section, which extends the judicial power "to controversies between a state and citizens of another state." It is contended, that this ought to be construed to reach none of these controversies, excepting those in which a State may be Plaintiff. The ordinary rules for construction will easily decide whether those words are to be understood in that limited sense.</p>
<p>This extension of power is remedial, because it is to settle controversies. It is therefore, to be construed liberally. It is politic, wife, and good that, not only the controversies, in which a State is Plaintiff, but also those in which a State is Defendant, should be settled; both cases, therefore, are within the reason of the remedy; and ought to be so adjudged, unless the obvious, plain, and literal sense of the words forbid it. If we attend to the words, we find them to be express, positive, free from ambiguity, and without room for such implied expressions: "The judicial power of the United States shall extend to controversies between a state and citizens of another state." If the Constitution really meant to extend these powers only to those controversies in which a State might be Plaintiff, to the exclusion of those in which citizens had demands against a State, it is inconceivable that it should have attempted to convey that meaning in words, not only so incompetent, but also repugnant to it; if it meant to exclude a certain class of these controversies, why were they not expressly excepted; on the contrary, not even an intimation of such intention appears in <span class="star-pagination">*477</span> any part of the Constitution. It cannot be pretended that where citizens urge and insist upon demands against a State, which the State refuses to admit and comply with, that there is no controversy between them. If it is a controversy between them, then it clearly falls not only within the spirit, but the very words of the Constitution. What is it to the cause of justice, and how can it effect the definition of the word controversy, whether the demands which cause the dispute, are made by a State against citizens of another State, or by the latter against the former? When power is thus extended to a controversy, it necessarily, as to all judicial purposes, is also extended to those, between whom it subsists.</p>
<p>The exception contended for, would contradict and do violence to the great and leading principles of a free and equal national government, one of the great objects of which is, to ensure justice to all: To the few against the many, as well as to the many against the few. It would be strange, indeed, that the joint and equal sovereigns of this country, should, in the very Constitution by which they professed to establish justice, so far deviate from the plain path of equality and impartiality, as to give to the collective citizens of one State, a right of suing individual citizens of another State, and yet deny to those citizens a right of suing them. We find the same general and comprehensive manner of expressing the same ideas, in a subsequent clause; in which the Constitution ordains, that "in all cases affecting Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, and those in which a state shall be a party, the Supreme Court shall have original jurisdiction." Did it mean here party-Plaintiff? If that only was meant, it would have been easy to have found words to express it. Words are to be understood in their ordinary and common acceptation, and the word party being in common usage, applicable both to Plaintiff and Defendant, we cannot limit it to one of them in the present case. We find the Legislature of the United States expressing themselves in the like general and comprehensive manner; they speak in the 13th section of the judicial act, of controversies where a State is a party, and as they do not impliedly or expressly apply that term to either of the litigants, in particular, we are to understand them as speaking of both. In the same section they distinguish the cases where Ambassadors are Plaintiffs, from those in which Ambassadors are Defendants, and make different provisions respecting those cases; and it is not unnatural to suppose, that they would in like manner have distinguished between cases where a State was Plaintiff, and where a State was Defendant, if they had intended to make any difference between them; or if they had apprehended that the Constitution had made any difference between them.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*478</span> I perceive, and therefore candor urges me to mention, a circumstance, which seems to favor the opposite side of the question. It is this: the same section of the Constitution which extends the judicial power to controversies "between a State and the citizens of another State," does also extend that power to controversies to which the United States are a party. Now, it may be said, if the word party comprehends both Plaintiff and Defendant, it follows, that the United States may be sued by any citizen, between whom and them there may be a controversy. This appears to me to be fair reasoning; but the same principles of candour which urge me to mention this objection, also urge me to suggest an important difference between the two cases. It is this: in all cases of actions against States or individual citizens, the National Courts are supported in all their legal and Constitutional proceedings and judgments, by the arm of the Executive power of the United States; but in cases of actions against the United States, there is no power which the Courts can call to their aid. From this distinction important conclusions are deducible, and they place the case of a State, and the case of the United States, in very different points of view.</p>
<p>I with the State of society was so far improved, and the science of Government advanced to such a degree of perfection, as that the whole nation could in the peaceable course of law, be compelled to do justice, and be sued by individual citizens. Whether that is, or is not, now the case, ought not to be thus collaterally and incidentally decided: I leave it a question.</p>
<p>As this opinion, though deliberately formed, has been hastily reduced to writing between the intervals of the daily adjournments, and while my mind was occupied and wearied by the business of the day, I fear it is less concise and connected than it might otherwise have been. I have made no references to cases, because I know of none that are not distinguishable from this case; nor does it appear to me necessary to shew that the sentiments of the best writers on Government and the rights of men, harmonize with the principles which direct my judgment on the present question. The acts of the former Congresses, and the acts of many of the State Conventions, are replete with similar ideas; and to the honor of the United States, it may be observed, that in no other country are subjects of this kind better, if so well, understood. The attention and attachment of the Constitution to the equal rights of the people are discernable in almost every sentence of it; and it is to be regretted that the provision in it which we have been considering, has not in every instance received the approbation and acquiescence which it merits. Georgia has in strong language advocated the cause of republican equality: and there is reason to <span class="star-pagination">*479</span> hope that the people of that State will yet perceive that it would not have been consistent with that equality, to have exempted the body of her citizens from that suability, which they are at this moment exercising against citizens of another State.</p>
<p>For my own part, I am convinced that the sense in which I understand and have explained the words "controversies between States and citizens of another State," is the true sense. The extension of the judiciary power of the United States to such controversies, appears to me to be wife, because it is honest, and because it is useful. It is honest, because it provides for doing justice without respect of persons, and by securing individual citizens as well as States, in their respective rights, performs the promise which every free Government makes to every free citizen, of equal justice and protection. It is useful, because it is honest, because it leaves not even the most obscure and friendless citizen without means of obtaining justice from a neighbouring State; because it obviates occasions of quarrels between States on account of the claims of their respective citizens; because it recognizes and strongly rests on this great moral truth, that justice is the same whether due from the man or a million, or from a million to one man; because it teaches and greatly appreciates the value of our free republican national Government, which places all our citizens on an equal footing, and enables each and every of them to obtain justice without any danger of being overborne by the weight and number of their opponents; and, because it brings into action, and enforces this great and glorious principle, that the people are the sovereign of this country, and consequently that fellow citizens and joint sovereigns cannot be degraded by appearing with each other in their own Courts to have their controversies determined. The people have reason to prize and rejoice in such valuable privileges; and they ought not to forget, that nothing but the free course of Constitutional law and Government can ensure the continuance and enjoyment of them.</p>
<p>For the reasons before given, I am clearly of opinion, that a State is suable by citizens of another State; but left I should be understood in a latitude beyond my meaning, I think it necessary to subjoin this caution, viz., That such suability may nevertheless not extend to all the demands, and to every kind of action; there may be exceptions. For instance, I am far from being prepared to say that an individual may sue a State on bills of credit issued before the Constitution was established, and which were issued and received on the faith of the State, and at a time when no ideas or expectations of judicial interposition were entertained or contemplated.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*480</span> The following order was made: Â— BY THE COURT. It is ordered, that the Plaintiff in this cause do file his declaration on or before the first day of March next.</p>
<p>Ordered, that certified copies of the said declaration be served on the Governor and Attorney General of the State of Georgia, on or before the first day of June next.</p>
<p>Ordered, that unless the said State shall either in due form appear, or shew cause to the contrary in this Court, by the first day of next Term, judgment by default shall be entered against the said State.<sup>[*]</sup></p>

<center><h1>The STATE OF GEORGIA,<br/>
versus<br/>
BRAILSFORD, et al.</h1></center>
<center><p><b>Supreme Court of United States.</b></p></center>
<center></center>
<p>For the plaintiff, Ingersoll and Dallas, proposed two objects for enquiry.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*3</span> The argument having continued for four days, the Chief Justice delivered the following charge on the 7th of February.</p>
<p>JAY, Chief Justice.</p>
<p>This cause has been regarded as of great importance; and doubtless it is so. It has accordingly been treated by the Counsel with great learning, diligence and ability; and on your part it has been heard with particular attention. It is, therefore, unnecessary for me to follow the investigation over the extensive field into which it has been carried: you are now, if ever you can be, completely possessed of the merits of the cause.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*4</span> The facts comprehended in the case, are agreed; the only point that remains, is to settle what is the law of the land arising from those facts; and on that point, it is proper, that the opinion of the court should be given. It is fortunate on the present, as it must be on every occasion, to find the opinion of the court unanimous: We entertain no diversity of sentiment; and we have experienced no difficulty in uniting in the charge, which it is my province to deliver.</p>
<p>We are then, Gentlemen, of opinion, that the debts due to Hopton &amp; Powell (who were citizens of South-Carolina) were not confiscated by the statute of South-Carolina; the same being therein expressly excepted: That those debts were not confiscated by the statute of Georgia, for that statute enacts, with respect to Powell &amp; Hopton, precisely the like, and no other, degree and extent of confiscation and forfeiture, with that of South-Carolina. Wherefore it cannot now be necessary to decide, how far one state may of right legislate relative to the personal rights of citizens of another state, not residing within their jurisdiction.</p>
<p>We are also of opinion, that the debts due to Brailsford, a British subject, residing in Great Britain, were by the statute of Georgia subjected, not to confiscation, but only to sequestration; and, therefore, that his right to recover them, revived at the peace, both by the law of nations and the treaty of peace.</p>
<p>The question of forfeiture in the case of joint obligees, being at present immaterial, need not now be decided.</p>
<p>It may not be amiss, here, Gentlemen, to remind you of the good old rule, that on questions of fact, it is the province of the jury, on questions of law, it is the province of the court to decide. But it must be observed that by the same law, which recognizes this reasonable distribution of jurisdiction, you have nevertheless a right to take upon yourselves to judge of both, and to determine the law as well as the fact in controversy. On this, and on every other occasion, however, we have no doubt, you will pay that respect, which is due to the opinion of the court: For, as on the one hand, it is presumed, that juries are the best judges of facts; it is, on the other hand, presumable, that the court are the best judges of law. But still both objects are lawfully, within your power of decision.</p>
<p>Some stress has been laid on a consideration of the different situations of the parties to the cause: The State of Georgia, sues three private persons. But what is it to justice, how many, or how few; how high, or how low; how rich, or how poor; the contending parties may chance to be? Justice is indiscriminately due to all, without regard to numbers, wealth, or rank. Because to the State of Georgia, composed of many <span class="star-pagination">*5</span> thousands of people, the litigated sum cannot be of great moment, you will not for this reason be justisted, in deciding against her claim; if the money belongs to her, she ought to have it; but on the other hand, no consideration of the circumstances, or of the comparative insignificance of the defendants, can be a ground to deny them the advantage of a favourable verdict, if in justice they are entitled to it.</p>
<p>Go then, Gentlemen, from the bar, without any impressions of favor or prejudice for the one party or the other; weigh well the merits of the case, and do on this, as you ought to do on every occasion, equal and impartial justice."</p>
<p>The jury having been absent some time, returned to the bar, and proposed the following questions to the court.</p>
<p>1. Did the act of the State of Georgia, completely vest the debts of Brailsford, Powell &amp; Hopton, in the State, at the time of passing the same?</p>
<p>2. If so, did the treaty of peace, or any other matter, revive the right of the defendants to the debt in controversy?</p>
<p>In answer to these questions, the CHIEF JUSTICE stated, that it was intended in the general charge of the court, to comprise their sentiments upon the points now suggested; but as the jury entertained a doubt, the enquiry was perfectly right. On the 1st question, he said it was the unanimous opinion of the judges, that the act of the State of Georgia did not vest the debts of Brailsford, Powell &amp; Hopton, in the State at the time of passing it. On the 2d question he said, that no sequestration divests the property in the thing sequestered; and, consequently, Brailsford, at the peace, and indeed, throughout the war, was the real owner of the debt. That it is true, the State of Georgia interposed with her legislative authority to prevent Brailford's recovering the debt while the war continued, but, that the mere restoration of peace, as well as the very terms of the treaty, revived the right of action to recover the debt, the property of which had never in fact or law been taken from the defendants: and that if it were otherwise, the sequestration would certainly remain a lawful impediment to the recovering of a bona fide debt, due to a British creditor, in direct opposition to the 4th article of the treaty.</p>
<p>After this explanation, the jury, without going again from the bar, returned a Verdict for the defendants.</p>

<center><p><b>Supreme Court of United States.</b></p></center>
<center></center>
<p>It was argued by E. Tilghman and Lewis, for the appellants; and by Winchester (of Maryland) and Du Ponceau, for the appellee.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*15</span> THE COURT, having kept the cause under advisement for several days, informed the counsel, that besides the question of jurisdiction as to the District Court, another question fairly arose upon the record, Â— whether any foreign nation had a right, without the positive stipulations of a treaty, to establish in this country, an admiralty jurisdiction for taking cognizance of prizes captured on the high seas, by its subjects or citizens, from its enemies? Though this question had not been agitated, THE COURT deemed it of great public importance to be decided; and, meaning to decide it, they declared a desire to hear it discussed. Du Ponceau, however, observed, that the parties to the appeal did not conceive themselves interested in <span class="star-pagination">*16</span> the point; and that the French minister had given no instructions for arguing it. Upon which, JAY, Chief Justice, proceeded to deliver the following unanimous opinion.</p>
<p>BY THE COURT: The Judges being decidedly of opinion, that every District Court in the United States, possesses all the powers of a court of Admiralty, whether considered as an instance, or as a prize court, and that the plea of the aforesaid Appellee, Pierre Arcade Johannene, to the jurisdiction of the District Court of Maryland, is insufficient: THEREFORE IT IS CONSIDERED by the Supreme Court aforesaid, and now finally decreed and adjudged by the same, that the said plea be, and the same is hereby overruled and dismissed, and that the decree of the said District Court of Maryland, founded thereon, be, and the same is hereby revoked, reversed and annulled.</p>
<p>AND the said Supreme Court being further clearly of opinion, that the District Court of Maryland aforesaid, has jurisdiction competent to enquire, and to decide, whether, in the present case, restitution ought to be made to the claimants, or either of them, in whole or in part (that is whether such restitution can be made consistently with the laws of nations and the treaties and laws of the United States) THEREFORE IT IS ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the said District Court of Maryland do proceed to determine upon the libel of the said Alexander S. Glass, and others, agreeably to law and right, the said plea to the jurisdiction of the said court, notwithstanding.</p>
<p>AND the said Supreme Court being further of opinion, that no foreign power can of right institute, or erect, any court of judicature of any kind, within the jurisdiction of the United States, but such only as may be warranted by, and be in pursuance of treaties, IT IS THEREFORE DECREED AND ADJUDGED that the admiralty jurisdiction, which has been exercised in the United States by the Consuls of France, not being so warranted, is not of right.</p>
<p>IT IS FURTHER ORDERED by the said Supreme Court, that this cause be, and it is hereby, remanded to the District Court, for the Maryland District, for a final decision, and that the several parties to the same do each pay their own costs.</p>

<p>Rawle (the attorney-general of the district) admitted.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*18</span> THE COURT, after holding the subject for some days under advisement, directed the prisoner to be admitted to bail, himself in the sum of 4000 dollars, and two sureties, each in the sum of 2000 dollars.</p>
<p>WILSON, Justice.</p>
<p>The recognizance must be taken for the defendant's appearance at the next stated Circuit Court. The motion for appointing a special Circuit Court to try offences of this description, at a place nearer to the scene in which they occurred, has not escaped our attention; and with a wish, if possible, to grant it, we have viewed the subject in every light; but hitherto the difficulties are apparently insurmountable. We will, however, state the principal ones, that the Counsel may, if they please, endeavour to remove them.</p>
<p>1. The next stated Circuit Court is so near, that it will not be possible to commence and finish the business of the trials for Treason, at a Special Court to be previously held; and it is very questionable, whether we can appoint a Special Circuit Court at a distant period, to overleap the session of the stated Court. The impropriety of such an interference is the more striking, when it is recollected, that the Circuit Court itself, as well as the Supreme Court, has a power to appoint a special sessions for the trial of criminal causes. 1 Vol. s. 4. p. 51.</p>
<p>2. But even if a special Court were to be appointed to be held at a distant period, overleaping the stated Circuit Court, could an indictment found at the latter, be prosecuted and tried at the former? There is a provision, "That all business depending for trial at any Special Court, shall, at the close thereof, be considered as of course removed to the next stated term of the Circuit Court," (2 Vol. Swift's Edit. s. 3. p. 227.) but there is no power given to remit to a special Court, the business depending for trial, before the stated Circuit Court.</p>
<p>3. And suppose a special Circuit Court were to be appointed previously to the stated Court, could both be in session at the same time? Or, could two grand juries be impannelled at the same time, for the same district, and both be qualified to present all the offences, (including, of course, the offences of Treason) committed within their jurisdiction<sup>[*]</sup>.</p>
<h2>NOTES</h2>
<p>[*]  Lewis and M. Levy, (as I am informed) attempted to obviate the obstacles above suggested; but, it appears, without effect, as a special Circuit Court was not appointed on this occasion. See the Trials for Treason, 2 vol. p. 335. to p. 357.</p>

<center><p><b>Supreme Court of United States.</b></p></center>
<center></center>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*79</span> On the 24th of Feb. 1795, the Judges delivered their opinions seriatim.</p>
<p>PATERSON, Justice:</p>
<p>This cause has been much obscured by the irregularity of the pleadings, which present a medley of procedure, partly according to the common, and partly according to the civil, law. We must endeavour to extract a state of the case from the Record, Documents, and Acts, which have been exhibited.</p>
<p>[Here the Judge delivered the historical narrative of the cause, with which this report is introduced, and then proceeded as follows:]</p>
<p>PATERSON, Justice.</p>
<p>I have been particular in stating the case, and giving an historical narrative of the transaction, in order that the grounds of decision may be fully understood. The pleadings consist of a heap of materials, thrown together in an irregular manner, and, if examined by the strict rules of common law, cannot stand the test of legal criticism. We are, however, to view the proceedings as before a Court of Admiralty, which is not governed by the rigid principles of common law. Order and systematic arrangement are no small beauties in juridical proceedings; and, whatever may be said to the contrary, it will, on fair investigation, appear, that good pleading is founded on sound logic, and good sense.</p>
<p>In the discussion of the cause, several questions have been agitated; some of which, involving constitutional points, are of great importance.</p>
<p>The jurisdiction of the Commissioners of Appeals has been questioned.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*80</span> The jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals has been questioned.</p>
<p>These jurisdictions turning on the competency of Congress, it has been questioned, whether that body had authority to institute such tribunals.</p>
<p>And, lastly, the jurisdiction of the District Court of New Hampshire has been questioned. In every step we take, the point of jurisdiction meets us.</p>
<p>I. The question first in order, is, whether the Commissioners of Appeals had jurisdiction, or, in other words, whether Congress, before the ratification of the articles of confederation, had authority to institute such a tribunal, with appellate jurisdiction in cases of prize?</p>
<p>Much has been said respecting the powers of Congress. On this part of the subject the counsel on both sides displayed great ingenuity, and erudition, and that too in a stile of eloquence equal to the magnitude of the question. The powers of Congress were revolutionary in their nature, arising out of events, adequate to every national emergency, and co-extensive with the object to be attained. Congress was the general, supreme, and controuling council of the nation, the centre of union, the centre of force, and the sun of the political system. To determine what their powers were, we must enquire what powers they exercised. Congress raised armies, fitted out a navy, and prescribed rules for their government: Congress conducted all military operations both by land and sea: Congress emitted bills of credit, received and sent ambassadors, and made treaties: Congress commissioned privateers to cruize against the enemy, directed what vessels should be liable to capture, and prescribed rules for the distribution of prizes. These high acts of sovereignty were submitted to, acquiesced in, and approved of, by the people of America. In Congress were vested, because by Congress were exercised with the approbation of the people, the rights and powers of war and peace. In every government, whether it consists of many states, or of a few, or whether it be of a federal or consolidated nature, there must be a supreme power or will; the rights of war and peace are component parts of this supremacy, and incidental thereto is the question of prize. The question of prize grows out of the nature of the thing. If it be asked, in whom, during our revolution war, was lodged, and by whom was exercised this supreme authority? No one will hesitate for an answer. It was lodged in, and exercised by, Congress; it was there, or no where; the states individually did not, and, with safety, could not exercise it. Disastrous would have been the issue of the contest, if the States, separately, had exercised the powers of war. For, in such case, there would have been as many supreme <span class="star-pagination">*81</span> wills as there were states, and as many wars as there were wills. Happily, however, for America, this was not the case; there was but one war, and one sovereign will to conduct it. The danger being imminent, and common, it became necessary for the people or colonies to coalesce and act in concert, in order to divert, or break, the violence of the gathering storm; they accordingly grew into union, and formed one great political body, of which Congress was the directing principle and soul. As to war and peace, and their necessary incidents, Congress, by the unanimous voice of the people, exercised exclusive jurisdiction, and stood, like Jove, amidst the deities of old, paramount, and supreme. The truth is, that the States, individually, were not known nor recognized as sovereign, by foreign nations, nor are they now; the States collectively, under Congress, as the connecting point, or head, were acknowledged by foreign powers as sovereign, particularly in that acceptation of the term, which is applicable to all great national concerns, and in the exercise of which other sovereigns would be more immediately interested; such, for instance, as the rights of war and peace, of making treaties, and sending and receiving ambassadors. Besides, every body must be amenable to the authority under which he acts. If he accept from Congress a commission to cruize against the enemy, he must be responsible to them for his conduct. If, under colour of such commission, he had violated the law of nations, Congress would have been called upon to make atonement and redress. The persons who exercise the right or authority of commissioning privateers, must, of course, have the right or authority of examining into the conduct of the officer acting under such commission, and of confirming or annulling his transactions and deeds. In the present case, the Captain of the M'Clary obtained his commission from Congress; under that commission he cruised on the high seas, and captured the Susanna; and for the legality of that capture he must ultimately be responsible to Congress, or their constituted authority. This results from the nature of the thing; and, besides, was expressly stipulated on the part of Congress. The authority exercised by Congress in granting commissions to privateers, was approved and ratified by the several colonies or states, because they received and filled up the commissions and bonds, and returned the latter to Congress Â— New-Hampshire did so, as well as the rest.</p>
<p>Another circumstance, worthy of notice, is the conduct of New-Hampshire, by her Delegate in Congress, in the case of the sloop Active. Acts of Congress, 6th March, 1779. Â— By this decision, New-Hampshire concurred in binding the other states. Did she not also bind herself? Before the articles of confederation were ratified, or even formed, a league of some kind subsisted <span class="star-pagination">*82</span> among the states; and, whether that league originated in compact, or a sort of tacit consent, resulting from their situation, the exigencies of the times, and the nature of the warfare, or from all combined, is utterly immaterial. The States, when in Congress, stood on the floor of equality; and, until otherwise stipulated, the majority of them must controul. In such a confederacy, for a state to bind others, and not, in similar cases, be bound herself, is a solecism. Still, however, it is contended, that New-Hampshire was not bound, nor Congress sovereign as to war and peace, and their incidents, because they resisted this supremacy in the case of the Susanna. But I am, notwithstanding, of opinion, that New-Hampshire was bound, and Congress supreme, for the reasons already assigned, and that the continued to be bound, because she continued in the confederacy. As long as she continued to be one of the federal states, it must have been on equal terms. If the would not submit to the exercise of the act of sovereignty contended for by Congress, and the other states, she should have withdrawn herself from the confederacy.</p>
<p>In the Resolutions of Congress of the 6th of March, 1779, is contained a course of reasoning, which, in my opinion, is cogent and conclusive. 5 Jour. Cong. 86, 87, 88, 89, 90.</p>
<p>"The committee, consisting of Mr. Floyd, Mr. Ellery, and Mr. Burke, to whom was referred the report of the committee on appeals of January 19th, 1779, having, in pursuance of the instructions to them given, examined into the causes of the refusal of the Judge of the Court of Admiralty for the State of Pennsylvania, to carry into execution the decree of the Court or committee of appeals, report,</p>
<p>"That on a libel in the court of admiralty for the state of Pennsylvania in the case of the sleep Active, the jury found a verdict in the following words, viz. "one fourth of the nett proceeds of the sloop Active and her cargo to the first claimants, three fourths of the nett proceeds of the said sloop and her cargo to the libellant and the second claimant, as per agreement between them; which verdict was confirmed by the judge of the court, and sentence passed thereon. From this sentence or judgment and verdict, an appeal was lodged with the secretary of Congress, and referred to the committee appointed by Congress "to hear and determine finally upon all appeals brought to Congress," from the Courts of Admiralty of the several States:</p>
<p>"That the said committee, after solemn argument and full hearing of the parties by their advocates, and taking time to consider thereof, proceeded to the publication of their definitive sentence or decree, thereby reversing the sentence of the Court of Admiralty, making a new decree, and ordering process to <span class="star-pagination">*83</span> issue out of the Court of Admiralty for the state of Pennsylvania to carry this their decree into execution:</p>
<p>"That the judge of the Court of Admiralty refused to carry into execution the decree of the said committee on appeals, and has assigned as the reason of his refusal, that an act of the Legislature of the said State has declared, that the finding of a jury shall establish the facts in all trials in the Courts of Admiralty, without re-examination or appeal, and that an appeal is permitted only from the decree of the judge:</p>
<p>"That having examined the said act, which is entitled, "an act for establishing a Court of Admiralty," passed at a session which commenced on the 4th of August, 1778, the committee find the following words, viz. "the finding of a jury shall establish the facts, without re-examination, or appeal," and in the seventh section of the same act the following words, viz. "in all cases of captures an appeal from the decree of the Judge of Admiralty of this State, shall be allowed to the Continental Congress, or such person or persons as they may from time to time appoint for hearing and trying appeals."</p>
<p>"That although Congress, by their resolution of November 25th, 1775, recommended it to the several legislatures, to erect courts for the purpose of determining concerning captures, and to provide that all trials in such cases be had by a jury, yet it is provided, that in all cases an appeal shall be allowed to Congress, or to such person or persons as they shall appoint for the trial of appeals:" whereupon,</p>
<p>"Resolved, That Congress, or such person or persons as they appoint, to hear and determine appeals from the courts of Admiralty, have necessarily the power to examine as well into decisions on facts as decisions on the law, and to decree finally thereon, and that no finding of a jury in any court of Admiralty, or court for determining the legality of captures on the high seas, can or ought to destroy the right of appeal, and the re-examination of the facts reserved to Congress:</p>
<p>"That no act of any one state can or ought to destroy the right of appeals to Congress, in the sense above declared:</p>
<p>"That Congress is by these United States, invested with the supreme sovereign power of war and peace:</p>
<p>"That the power of executing the law of nations is essential to the sovereign supreme power of war and peace:</p>
<p>"That the legality of all captures on the high seas must be determined by the law of nations:</p>
<p>"That the authority ultimately and finally to decide on all matters and questions touching the law of nations, does reside and is vested in the sovereign supreme power of war and peace:</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*84</span> "That a controul by appeal is necessary, in order to compel a just and uniform execution of the law of nations.</p>
<p>"That the said controul must extend as well over the decisions of juries, as judges, in courts for determining the legality of captures on the sea; otherwise the juries would be possessed of the ultimate supreme power of executing the law of nations in all cases of captures, and might, at any time, exercise the same in such manner, as to prevent a possibility of being controuled; a construction which involves many inconveniences and absurdities, destroys an essential part of the power of war and peace entrusted to Congress, and would disable the Congress of the United States, from giving satisfaction to foreign nations complaining of a violation of neutralities, of treaties, or other breaches of the law of nations, and would enable a jury, in any one state, to involve the United States in hostilities; a construction, which for these and many other reasons, is inadmissible:</p>
<p>"That this power of controuling by appeal, the several admiralty jurisdictions of the States, has hitherto been exercised by Congress, by the medium of a committee of their own members:</p>

<p>The Congress then voted as follows, viz.</p>
<p>"Resolved, That the said committee had competent jurisdiction to make thereon a final decree, and therefore their decree ought to be carried into execution."</p>
<p>The yeas and nays being taken on this resolution, it appears, that New-Hampshire, Massachusetts-Bay, Rhode-Island, Connecticut, New-York, Maryland, Virginia, North-Carolina, South-Carolina, and Georgia, voted unanimously in the affirmative; Pennsylvania unanimously in the negative; and Mr. Witherspoon, who was alone from New-Jersey, voted on this occasion in the affirmative.</p>
<p>The Congress then resolved as follows, viz.</p>
<p>"Resolved, That the General Assembly of the State of Pennsylvania, be requested to appoint a committee, to confer with a committee of Congress, on the subject of the proceedings <span class="star-pagination">*85</span> relative to the sloop Active, and the objections made to the execution of the decree of the committee on appeals, to the end that proper measures may be adopted for removing the said obstacles; and that a committee of three be appointed to hold the said conference, with the committee of the General Assembly of Pennsylvania:</p>
<p>"The members chosen, Mr. Paca, Mr. Burke, and Mr. R.H. Lee."</p>
<p>I shall close this head of discourse with observing, that it is with diffidence I have ventured to give an opinion on a questien so novel and intricate, and respecting which, men, eminent for their talents, their literary attainments, and skill in jurisprudence, have been divided in sentiment. The opinion, however, which has been given, is the result of conviction; if wrong, it is the error of the head, and as such will carry its apology with it.</p>
<p>II. Whether, after the articles of consederation were ratified, the Court of Appeals had jurisdiction of the subject matter?</p>
<p>However problematical the opinion, which has been delivered on the preceding point, may be, I apprehend, that little doubt or difficulty can arise on the present question. By the 9th article of the Consederation, the United States, in Congress assembled, are vested, among other things, with the sole and exclusive power of establishing rules for deciding in all cases, what captures on land or water shall be legal, and in what manner prizes, taken by land or naval forces in the service of the United States, shall be divided or appropriated; of granting letters of marque and reprisal in times of peace; appointing courts for the trial of piracies and felonies committed on the high seas, and establishing courts for receiving and determining finally, appeals in all cases of captures.</p>
<p>The Court of Appeals, in September 1783, decided upon the point of jurisdiction either directly, or incidentally; for, after a full hearing, they decreed that the sentences passed by the Superior and Inferior Courts of New-Hampshire should be reversed and annulled, and the property be restored. This decree being made by a court, constitutionally established, of competent authority, and the highest jurisdiction, is conclusive and final. It cannot be opened and investigated; for, neither this court, nor any other, can, in a collateral way, review the proceedings of a tribunal, which had jurisdiction of the subject-matter. The Court of Appeals was competent to the decision; they have adjudicated as well on the jurisdiction as the merits of the cause, and we must suppose that they have acted properly. This also is an answer as to irregularities, if any there were, which may have taken place in the proceedings <span class="star-pagination">*86</span> before the Court of Appeals, or in the mode of removing the cause before them. This court cannot take notice of irregularities in the proceedings, or error in the decision, of the Court of Appeals. The question is at rest; it ought not to be again disturbed.</p>
<p>III. Whether the District Court of New-Hampshire had jurisdiction; or, in other words, whether the libel exhibited before that court, was the proper remedy, or mode of carrying into execution, either specifically, or by way of damages, the decree of the Court of Appeals?</p>
<p>On this point I entertain no doubts. Recurrence to facts will answer the question. The existence of the Court of Appeals terminated with the old government; this also was the case with the subordinate Court of Admiralty in the State of New-Hampshire. The property was not restored to the libellants, nor were they compensated in damages; of course the decree in their favour remains unsatisfied. They had no remedy at common law; they had none in equity; the only forum competent to give redress is the District Court of New-Hampshire, because it has admiralty jurisdiction. There they applied, and, in my opinion, with great propriety.</p>
<p>Judges may die, and courts be at an end; but justice still lives, and, though she may sleep for a while, will eventually awake, and must be satisfied.</p>
<p>Having discussed the preliminary questions relative to jurisdiction, we shall now consider the proceedings in the Circuit Court of New-Hampshire. And here the first question is, whether by the death of Elisha Doane, before the judgment rendered in the court of appeals, that judgment is not avoided? The death of Doane does not appear on the record of the proceedings before the court of appeals; it is in evidence from the certificate of the judge of probates, which is annexed to the record transmitted from the Circuit Court of New-Hampshire. Many answers have been given to this question; some of which are cogent as well as plausible. On this subject, it will be sufficient to observe, that admitting the death of Doane, and that it can be taken notice of in this court, it is unavailing, because the proceedings in a court of admiralty are in rem. The sentence of a court of admiralty, or of appeal in questions of prize, binds all the world, as to every thing contained in it, because all the world are parties to it. The sentence, so far as it goes, is conclusive to all persons.</p>
<p>The most formidable objections have been levelled against the damages.</p>
<p>1. It is said, that the damages ought not to have been given, because they were not prayed. The answer to this objection <span class="star-pagination">*87</span> is satisfactory Â— the prayer is for general relief, and therefore sufficient.</p>
<p>2. If any damages ought to be given, yet none ought to have been awarded against George Wentworth, because he was an agent, and paid the money over under the decree of the Court of New Hampshire.</p>
<p>If any Agent pay over, after notice, he pays wrongfully, and shall not be excused. In this case George Wentworth was a party to the suit, he appeared as one of the Libellants, and must be liable to all the legal consequences resulting from such a situation. As a party, he was before the court, and privy to the appeal, which was made in due season. The appeal did, from the moment it was made, suspend the execution of the decree, and that whether it was received or not;<sup>[*]</sup> especially in cases like the present, where George Wentworth was a party to the suit, before the court, and had notice of its having been tendered or made. In such a predicament, he ought not to have paid over; but should have awaited the ultimate decision of the Court of Appeals. If he paid, it was at his peril; he took the risk upon himself, and in case of undue payment, became liable.</p>
<p>It has been said, that an inhibition should have been issued, and that without it the appeal did not suspend the execution of the decree. The writ of inhibition is a proper and necessary writ, not because it suspends the effect of the decree, for that is already done by the appeal; but because it enables the court of appellate jurisdiction, in case of disobedience, to punish the inferior court as being in contempt. The appeal has not this effect, because it is the act of the party, and not of the superior court.</p>
<p>A monition, it is said, ought to have been addressed to the Appellees to enforce their appearance before the Court of appellate jurisdiction. The answer is, that George Wentworth, as well as the others, did appear both before the Court of Commissioners and the Court of Appeals. If a defect, and inquirable into by this court, it is cured by appearance.</p>
<p>In short, George Wentworth was a party to the suit, present in court, and had notice of the appeal. If, in such a situation, he undertook to distribute the proceeds, it was at his own risk: and in case of reversal, he made himself liable.</p>
<p>I have doubts how far the court below could inquire into the question of agency and payment over, especially as the payment is said to have been made, previously to the argument before the Court of Appeals, or even the Court of Commissioners. The decree is for restoration. If the Court of Appeals had issued process to carry their definitive sentence into effect, or <span class="star-pagination">*88</span> had directed the Maritime Courts of New Hampshire to have done so, would it, in the instance of George Wentworth, have been a legal justification to have said, that he had delivered the property, or paid its proceeds, to the captors? Besides, whatever could have been brought forward, by way of defence, in the Court of Appeals, ought there to have been urged and relied upon; and if the party has omitted to do so, he has slipt his opportunity, and is precluded from taking advantage thereof in future.</p>
<p>I know, that a distinction is made between foreign and domestic judgments; that the latter are conclusive, whereas the former are liable to investigation. Be it so. But is the principle, upon which this distinction is founded, applicable to decrees, on questions of prize, in the highest Court of Admiralty, which, in such cases, is guided by the law of Nations, and not municipal regulations? If it is, it must be under very special circumstances.</p>
<p>3. It is objected, that the damages awarded are joint; whereas they ought to have been several. This objection is a found one. But as the facts are spread on the record, it is in the power of the court to sever the damages, and so to apportion them as to effectuate substantial justice. The damages should have pursued and been admeasured by the original decree, which directed, that one moiety of the proceeds should be paid to the owners, and the other to the captors. George Wentworth received a moiety only; he is liable for that, and no more.</p>
<p>4. Another objection is, that interest has been calculated from a wrong period, to wit, from the 2d October, 1778; and therefore the decree of the Circuit Court is erroneous.</p>
<p>The Court of Appeals pronounced their definitive sentence in September 1783; by which the judgments of the inferior and superior Courts of New Hampshire were reversed, and restoration decreed; they also directed, that the parties should pay their own costs. I am of opinion, that interest should have been computed from the day, on which the definitive sentence of the Court of Appeals was pronounced. Of this there can be no doubt with respect to John Penhallow and the owners. Some doubts, however, have been entertained on this point with regard to George Wentworth. But for the reasons, which have been assigned, he must be considered in the same situation as the others.</p>
<p>Arguments, deducible from the hardship of the case, have been advanced and insisted upon. It is hard, that George Wentworth, who was an agent, should be made personally responsible. It is cruel, that George Wentworth should be cut down by the collision of conflicting jurisdictions. But motives of commiseration, from whatever source they flow, must not <span class="star-pagination">*89</span> mingle in the administration of justice. Judges, in the exercise of their functions, have frequent occasions to exclaim, "durum valde durum, sed sic lex est."</p>

<p>Equal to 32,721 dollars and 36 cents. The one moiety whereof, being 16,360 dollars and 68 cents, I am of opinion, should be paid by John Penhallow and the owners, and the other moiety by George Wentworth. The costs in the courts below should be divided in the same manner.</p>
<p>I am also of opinion, that the parties should bear their respective costs, which have arisen on the prosecution of the appeal in this court.</p>
<p>IREDELL, Justice.</p>
<p>This case, which is of so much novelty and importance, has been argued at the bar with very great ability on both sides. I have listened with the most respectful attention to every thing that has been said upon it, and the opinion, which I am now to deliver, is the result of the best consideration which I have been able to bestow on the subject.</p>
<p>The order in which it has appeared to me most convenient to arrange the different heads of enquiry is as follows:</p>
<p>1. Whether either of the decrees of June, 1779, or September, 1783, was originally valid?</p>
<p>2. If either of them was so, whether it was a decree which the District Court of New Hampshire, or the Circuit Court of New Hampshire, acting specially in this cause for the legal reason alledged, had authority to enforce, either by decreeing a specific execution, or awarding damages for a non-performance of it?</p>
<p>3. Whether, if the District or Circuit Court had such an authority, it has been executed properly in this instance, under all the circumstances of the case?</p>
<p>4. Whether, in case the Libellants were entitled to a decree in their favour, but it shall appear that the decree has been erroneous in respect to the relief given, either in the whole or in part, this court can rectify the decree, or order it to be rectified by the court below, or must affirm or reverse in the whole?</p>
<p>Under the first head it will be proper previously to consider if either of the decrees was final and conclusive, because if that point should be decided in the affirmative, it will render <span class="star-pagination">*90</span> unnecessary a decision of many important questions that otherwise arise in this cause. This previous point, however, cannot be decided on satisfactory principles, without in some measure tracing the origin of the general powers of Congress, from the time of the earliest exercise of their authority, to the period when definite and express powers were solemnly and formally given to them by the articles of confederation. I shall therefore make a few preliminary observations on this subject, though I by no means think it material to go into a full detail.</p>
<p>Under the British government, and before the opposition to the measures of the Parliament of Great Britain became necessary, each Province in America composed (as I conceive) a body politic, and the several Provinces were no otherwise connected with each other, than as being subject to the same common sovereign. Each Province had a distinct legislature, a distinct executive (subordinate to the king) a distinct judiciary and in particular the claim as to taxation, which began the contest, extended to a separate claim of each province to raise taxes within itself; no power then existed, or was claimed, for any joint authority on behalf of all the Provinces to tax the whole. There were some disputes as to boundaries, whether certain lands were within the bounds of one Province or another, but nobody denied that where the boundaries of any one Province could be ascertained, all the permanent inhabitants within those boundaries were members of the body politic, and subject to all the laws of it. When acts were passed by the Parliament of Great Britain which were thought unconstitutional and unjust, and when every hope of redress by separate applications appeared desperate, then was conceived the noble idea, which laid the foundation of the present independence and happiness of this country, (though independence was not then in contemplation) of forming a common council to consult for the common welfare of the whole, so far as an opposition to the measures of Great Britain was concerned. In order to compose this common council each Province chose for itself, in its own way, and by its own authority, without any previous concerted plan of the whole, deputies to attend at a general meeting to be held in this city. Some appointed by their Assemblies; others by Conventions; some perhaps in other modes; but, in whatever way the appointment was made, it was notoriously done with the hearty consent and approbation of the great body of the people in each Province, and therefore the appointment was unexceptionable to all those who thought the opposition just, and a union of the whole in the measures of opposition necessary. Each Province even appointed as many or as few deputies as it pleased, at its own discretion, which was not objected to, because the Members of Congress did not <span class="star-pagination">*91</span> vote individually, but the votes given in Congress were by Provinces, as they afterwards were (subsequent to the declaration of Independence, and until the present constitution of the United States was formed) by States.</p>
<p>The powers of Congress at first were indeed little more than advisory; but, in proportion as the danger increased, their powers were gradually enlarged, either by express grant, or by implication arising from a kind of indefinite authority, suited to the unknown exigencies that might arise. That an undefined authority is dangerous, and ought to be entrusted as cautiously as possible, every man must admit, and none could take more pains, than Congress for a long time did, to get their authority regularly defined by a ratification of the articles of confederation. But that previously thereto they did exercise, with the acquiescence of the States, high powers of what I may, perhaps, with propriety for distinction, call external sovereignty, is unquestionable. Among numerous instances that might be given of this, (and which were recited very minutely at the bar) were the treaties of France in 1778, which no friend to his country at the time questioned in point of authority, nor has been capable of reflecting upon since without gratitude and satisfaction. Whether among these powers comprehended within their general authority, was that of instituting courts for the trial of all prize causes, was a great and awful question; a question that demanded deep consideration, and not perhaps susceptible of an easy decision. That in point of prudence and propriety it was a power most sit for Congress to exercise, I have no doubt. I think all prize causes whatsoever ought to belong to the national sovereignty. They are to be determined by the law of nations. A prize court is, in effect, a court of all the nations in the world, because all persons, in every part of the world, are concluded by its sentences, in cases clearly coming within its jurisdiction. Even in the case of citizen and citizen I do not think it a proper subject for mere municipal regulation, because as was observed at the bar, a citizen may make a colourable claim, which the court may not be able to detect, and yet a foreigner be fatally injured by it. In case of a bona fide claim, it may appear to be good by the proofs offered to the court, but another person living at a distance may have a superior claim, which he has no opportunity to exhibit. It is true a general monition issues, and this is considered notice to all the world, but though this be the construction of the law from the necessity of the case, it would be absurd to infer in fact that all the world had actual notice, and therefore no superior claimant to the one before the court could possibly exist. The court, therefore, can never know with certainty whether citizens only are interested in the enquiry. But the words <span class="star-pagination">*92</span> "citizen and citizen" in this case are very ill applied to the parties in question, they not having been citizens of the same State, the captors having been citizens of New Hampshire, and the claimant a citizen of Massachusetts-Bay. It never was considered that before the actual signature of the articles of confederation a citizen of one State was to any one purpose a citizen of another. He was to all substantial purposes as a Foreigner to their forensic jurisprudence. If rigorous law had been enforced, perhaps he might have been deemed an alien, without an express provision of the State to save him. And as an unjust decision upon the law of nations, in the case of a Foreigner to all the States, might, if redress had not been given, have ultimately led to a foreign war, an unjust decision on the same law in one State, to the prejudice of a citizen of another State, might have ultimately led, if redress had not been given, to a civil war, an evil much the more dreadful of the two. I have made these observations merely as to the propriety that this power should have been delegated, and therefore to shew that if it was assumed without adequate authority, it was not an arbitrary and unnatural assumption of a power, that ought exclusively to belong to a single State; but by no means with a view to argue, that because it was proper to be given, therefore it was actually given, a position which, as it would lead to dangerous and inadmissible consequences, cannot be the ground of a legitimate argument.</p>
<p>Some of the arguments at the bar, if pushed to an extreme, would tend to establish, that Congress had unlimited power to act at their discretion, so far as the purposes of the war might require; and it was even said, that the Jus Belli never was in any one of the States, and therefore it could not be delegated by any State to Congress. My principles on this subject are totally different from those which were the foundation of this opinion, and as it is a point of no small importance, and I find on this occasion, as I have formerly done on others, considerable mistakes (as I conceive) by very able men, owing to a misapprehension of terms, I will endeavour to state my own principles on the subject with so much clearness, that whether my opinion be right or wrong, it may at least be understood what the opinion really is.</p>
<p>If Congress, previous to the articles of confederation, possessed any authority, it was an authority, as I have shewn, derived from the people of each Province in the first instance. When the obnoxious acts of Parliament passed, if the people in each Province had chosen to resist separately, they undoubtedly had equal right to do so, as to join in general measures of resistance with the people of the other Provinces, however unwise and destructive such a policy might, and undoubtedly <span class="star-pagination">*93</span> would have been. If they had pursued this separate system, and afterwards the people of each Province had resolved that such Province should be a free and independent State, the State from that moment would have become possessed of all the powers of sovereignty internal and external, (viz. the exclusive right of providing for their own government, and regulating their intercourse with foreign nations) as completely as any one of the ancient Kingdoms or Republics of the world, which never yet had formed, or thought of forming, any sort of Federal union whatever. A distinction was taken at the bar between a state and the people of the state. It is a distinction I am not capable of comprehending. By a State forming a Republic (speaking of it as a moral person) I do not mean the Legislature of the State, the Executive of the State, or the Judiciary, but all the citizens which compose that State, and are, if I may so express myself, integral parts of it; all together forming a body politic. The great distinction between Monarchies and Republics (at least our Republics) in general is, that in the former the monarch is considered as the sovereign, and each individual of his nation as subject to him, though in some countries with many important special limitations: This, I say, is generally the case, for it has not been so universally. But in a Republic, all the citizens, as such, are equal, and no citizen can rightfully exercise any authority over another, but in virtue of a power constitutionally given by the whole community, and such authority when exercised, is in effect an act of the whole community which forms such body politic. In such governments, therefore, the sovereignty resides in the great body of the people, but it resides in them not as so many distinct individuals, but in their politic capacity only. Thus A.B.C. and D. citizens of Pennsylvania, and as such, together with all the citizens of Pennsylvania, share in the sovereignty of the State. Suppose a State to consist exactly of the number of 100,000 citizens, and it were practicable for all of them to assemble at one time and in one place, and that 99,999 did actually assemble: The State would not be in fact assembled. Why? Because the state in fact is composed of all the citizens, not of a part only, however large that part may be, and one is wanting. In the same manner as 99l. is not a hundred, because one pound is wanting to complete the full sum. But as such exactness in human affairs cannot take place, as the world would be at an end, or involved in universal massacre and confusion, if entire unanimity from every society was required; as the assembling in large numbers, if practicable as to the actual meeting of all the citizens, or even a considerable part of them, could be productive of no rational result, because there could be no general debate, no consultation of the whole, nor <span class="star-pagination">*94</span> of consequence a determination grounded on reason and reflexion, and a deliberate view of all the circumstances necessary to be taken into consideration, mankind have long practised (except where special exceptions have been solemnly adopted) upon the principle, that the majority shall bind the whole, and in large countries, at least, that representatives shall be chosen to act on the part of the whole. But when they do so, they decide for the whole, and not for themselves only. Thus, when the legislature of any state passes a bill by a majority, competent to bind the whole, it is an act of the whole Assembly, not of the majority merely. So when this court gives a judgment by the opinion of a majority, it is the judgment, in a legal sense, of the whole court. So I conceive, when any law is passed in any state, in pursuance of constitutional authority, it is a law of the whole state acting in its legislative capacity; as are, also, executive and judiciary acts constitutionally authorised, acts of the whole state in its executive or judiciary capacity, and not the personal acts alone of the individuals, composing those branches of government. The same principles apply as to legislative, executive, or judicial acts of the United States, which are acts of the people of the United States, in those respective capacities, as the former are of the people of a single state. These principles have long been familiar in regard to the exercise of a constitutional power as to treaties. These are deemed the treaties of the two nations, not of the persons only, whole authority was actually employed in their formation. There is not one principle that I can imagine which gives such an effect as to treaties, that has not such an operation on any other legitimate act of government, all powers being equally derived from the same fountain, all held equally in trust, and all, when rightfully exercised, equally binding upon those from whom the authority was derived.</p>
<p>I conclude, therefore, that every particle of authority which originally resided either in Congress, or in any branch of the state governments, was derived from the people who were permanent inhabitants of each province in the first instance, and afterwards became citizens of each state; that this authority was conveyed by each body politic separately, and not by all the people in the several provinces, or states, jointly, and of course, that no authority could be conveyed to the whole, but that which previously was possessed by the several parts; that the distinction between a state and the people of a state has in this respect no foundation, each expression in substance meaning the same thing; consequently, that one ground of argument at the bar, tending to shew the superior sovereignty of Congress, in the instance in question, was not tenable, and therefore that upon that ground the exercise of the authority in question can not be supported.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*95</span> I have already, however, stated my opinion, that from the nature of our political situation, it was highly reasonable and proper that Congress should be possessed of such an authority, and this is a consideration of no small weight to induce an inference, that they actually possessed it when their powers were so indifinite, and when it seems to have been the sense of all the states, that Congress should possess all the incidents to external sovereignty, or, in other words, the power of war and peace, so far as other nations were concerned, though the states in some particulars differed, as to the construction of the general powers given for that purpose. Two principles appear to me to be clear. 1. The authority was not possessed by Congress, unless given by all the states. 2. If once given, no state could, by any act of its own, disavow and recall the authority previously given, without withdrawing from the confederation. In the case of the Active, ten states out of twelve recognized the authority, New-Hampshire voting in support of it. This was in 1779, long after the act of New-Hampshire was passed, which has given occasion to the controversy in this cause, and in the same year when the second act of New-Hampshire was passed, which allowed an appeal to Congress in cases (as the act expressed it) "wherein any subject or "subjects of any foreign nation or state, in amity with this "and the United States of America, should in due form of law, "claim the whole, or any part of the vessel and cargo in dispute." The resolution of Congress was dated the 6th March, 1779; the act of New-Hampshire in November following. The vote of the delegates of New-Hampshire, in the case of the Active, would not, indeed, be equivalent to a clear grant of the power, but it is a respectable support of the construction contended for by the defendants in error. It has been properly observed, that a court cannot by its own decision, give itself jurisdiction where it had none before; but if courts are so constituted that one is necessarily superior to another, the decision of the superior must, to be sure, prevail. This, perhaps, is not conclusive as to the court of commissioners, because it cannot be decided whether it was in fact the superior court in respect to New-Hampshire, without deciding whether it was constitutionally so in virtue of power from all the states. This point it would be now necessary for this court to decide, if it were not for the decision of the court of appeals in 1783, a court of acknowledged prize jurisdiction, established in virtue of express authority from all the states (New-Hampshire included) and made a court in the last resort as to all prize causes, or in other words (as expressed in the article of confederation itself) in all cases of captures. And the decision of this court on the subject of the two contending jurisdictions, I <span class="star-pagination">*96</span> consider to be final and conclusive, for the following reasons.</p>
<p>1. At the time the decision was given, it was the only court of final appellate jurisdiction, as to cases of captures, in the United States. It seems therefore to follow necessarily, that upon all questions of capture their decision should be final and conclusive, as much as the decision of this Court upon a writ of error from the Circuit Court, or any other branch of its jurisdiction, would be so.</p>
<p>2. To the suggestion at the bar, that the Court of appeals could have no retrospect, several answers, I conceive, may be given.</p>
<p>1. It is taking for granted the very point in dispute, that this decision was retrospective. If Congress possessed this authority before, and the articles of Confederation amounted only to a solemn confirmation of it, it was in no manner retrospective. It was in effect a continuance of the same court acting under an express, instead (as before) of acting under an implied authority, and allowing the full benefit of an appeal regularly prayed, and rightfully enforced by the superior tribunal, after an unwarranted dissallowance by the inferior.</p>
<p>2. Whether the article in the confederation giving authority to this court as a superior tribunal in all cases of capture, did authorise them to receive appeals in cases circumstanced like this, was a point for them to decide; since it was a question arising in a case of capture, of all which cases (without any exception) they were constituted judges in the last resort. The merits of their decision we surely cannot now enquire into, but their authority to decide, not being limited, there was no method, by applying to any other court, of correcting any error they might commit, if in reality they should have committed any.</p>
<p>3. Whether their decision was right or wrong, yet nobody can deny that the jurisdiction of the commissioners was at least doubtful; of course the Court of Appeals found a case then depending in the former court of the commissioners, after a preliminary, but not a final, determination, for such I consider it to have been. It was therefore a cause then sub judice, and it being a case of capture and a question of appeal, no other court on earth, but that, in my opinion, could decide it. And no objection can be urged in this case against the authority of such a decision, or the propriety of its being final, but such as may be urged against all courts in the last resort, with respect to the merits of whose decisions there may be eternal disputes, but such disputes would be productive of eternal war, if some court had not authority to settle such questions for ever.</p>
<p>I, therefore, have not the smallest doubt, that the decision of <span class="star-pagination">*97</span> the court in 1783, was final and conclusive as to the parties to the decree. And this point appears to me so plain, that I think it useless to take notice of any authorities quoted on either fide, in relation to it, none of them, I conceive, in any manner contravening the conclusive quality of such decrees upon the principles I have stated, and some of them clearly, and beyond all question, supporting it.</p>
<p>The decree of September, 1783, being by me thus deemed final and conclusive, the next enquiry is,</p>
<p>Whether it was a decree which the District Court of New-Hampshire, or the Circuit Court of New-Hampshire acting specially in this cause for the legal reason alleged, had authority to enforce, either by decreeing a specific execution, or awarding damages for a non-performance of it?</p>
<p>Upon this branch of the subject a few words will be sufficient. The District Court, by the act of Congress, hath the whole original jurisdiction in admiralty and maritime causes. Whatever doubt might otherwise have arisen, the decision of this court upon the writ of error from Maryland, last February, fully established, that this includes a prize jurisdiction, as well as other cases of a maritime nature. I was not present when the decision was given; had I been so, I probably should have concurred in it, because the words, "all civil causes of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction," evidently include all maritime causes, whether peculiarly of admiralty jurisdiction or not; because a question of prize on the high seas is clearly of a maritime nature, and therefore the English distinction between an instance (which is strictly an admiralty) court, and a prize court, does not apply to this case; more especially as the District Court having as large authority given to it in all maritime causes of a civil nature, as the constitution itself prescribes. If that court does not possess such an authority, no court can be instituted with powers adequate to that purpose, so that under the present constitution, there could be no prize jurisdiction at all; and the very tenure of all the judges (which is for good behaviour) naturally excludes the idea of a temporary and occasional establishment of any courts whatsoever. I mention these reasons, not because the authority of the case receives any additional sanction from my opinion, but because I was desirous to take so favourable an opportunity of expressing my concurrence in a decision of so much importance.<sup>[*]</sup></p>
<p>It was clearly shewn at the bar, that a Court of Admiralty in one nation, can carry into effect the determination of the Court of Admiralty of another. A Court of Prize being equally grounded on the law of nations as a Court of Admiralty, and proceeding also, as that does, on the principles of the civil law, <span class="star-pagination">*98</span> must, in common reason, have the same authority. I think it was rightly observed, that the sentence consisted, in effect, of two parts, one reversing the decree, and therefore vesting a right to a restitution or a recovery in value in the appellant, the other ordering a specific restitution. If that specific redress is from any cause rendered impracticable, those who have unjustly, and upon a sentence determined to be erroneous, received the property or its value to their own use, must in justice be accountable; otherwise form, which ought only to be the handmaid of right, might prove its treacherous destroyer. The District Court having sole original authority in cases of this kind, must have equal power, as to such subjects, with the power possessed by this court in any case where it has original jurisdiction, with this difference only, that in the one case a writ of error is allowed, in the other not. The Court of Appeals, which passed the final decree, having expired, there seems at least as much reason for a court of similar jurisdiction as to the subject-matter, proceeding to give effect to its decisions, as there can be for a Court of Admiralty of one nation giving effect to the decision of a Court of Admiralty of another, to which perhaps it is a perfect stranger, and of which it may know little more than that they equally belong to the great family of mankind. I am therefore of opinion, that the District Court, or the Circuit Court, acting specially in this instance on account of the incapacity of the former (as the law empowered it to do) had authority to enforce the decree in question, by decrecing damages in lieu of a specific restitution, which was impracticable.</p>
<p>The third question is,</p>
<p>Whether the authority hath been exercised properly in this instance, under all the circumstances of the case?</p>
<p>The material circumstances to be considered, either from facts admitted on the face of the record, or the public proceedings referred to by it, and of which we are judicially to take notice, seem to be as follow:</p>
<p>That the brig M'Clary was fitted out, under the authority, and pursuant to certain resolutions of Congress, in consequence of which, an act of the legislature had passed, in the state of New Hampshire, which complied partially with those resolutions, but made some regulations apparently intended as a restriction upon them (whatever might be their legal operation:) That on the 30th Oct. 1777, the captured the brig Susanna and cargo on the high seas: That the captured property was libelled in the Court Maritime of New Hampshire, (erected by the state law) on the 11th November, 1777: That Elisha Doane (whose administrators are the defendants in error in this cause) exhibited his claim on the 1st December following; and <span class="star-pagination">*99</span> on the 16th the property was condemned, and ordered to be distributed according to law: That within five days (the time for praying an appeal prescribed by the resolutions of Congress) Doane prayed an appeal to Congress, which was dissallowed: That he then prayed and obtained an appeal to the superior court of New Hampshire, agreeably to the directions of the state law, which allowed of such an appeal in cases of this kind, the act providing for an appeal to Congress, only in case of a capture by an armed vessel fitted out at the charge of the United Colonies: That on the first Tuesday in September, 1778, the superior court adjudged the property to be forfeited, and ordered it to be sold by the sheriff at public vendue for the use of the libellants; and the court further ordered, "that the proceeds "thereof, after deducting charges, should be paid to John Penhallow "and Jacob Treadwell, agents for the owners, and to "George Wentworth agent for the captors, to be by the said agents "paid and distributed to the persons mentioned therein, according "to the law of the state in that case made."</p>
<p>That an appeal from this decree to Congress was prayed within five days, and disallowed: and that afterwards, in obedience to the decree, and in virtue of it, the property was sold, and distributed to those entitled under the decree; and the proportionate shares (upon the supposition of a lawful capture) are admitted to have rightly been, one half to the owners, and the other half to the officers, mariners, and seamen.</p>
<p>That an application was afterwards made to the commissioners for hearing appeals under the authority of Congress; and after due notice to the libellants in the original suit, who appeared and pleaded to the jurisdiction, stating not only the defect of the authority of the court to sustain the appeal under any circumstances, but also special reasons why the Appellant was not entitled to the benefit of an appeal under the circumstances of the case (viz. the Appellant's waving the benefit of his appeal to Congress, by taking an actual appeal to the superior court of New-Hampshire; that the appeal first demanded, was not prosecuted for more than forty days; and that by the resolution of Congress, no appeal should be had from the verdict of a jury, but only the sentence of the judge) The commissioners, on the 26th June, 1779, decreed that they had jurisdiction, but declined any further proceedings at that time in the cause, for a reason they alledge.</p>
<p>That on the 12th September 1783, this case again came before the court of appeals, established under the articles of confederation; which, after a full hearing and solemn argument by the advocates on both sides, passed a definitive decree in these words, viz.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*100</span> "It is hereby considered, and finally adjudged and decreed by "this court, that the sentences or decrees passed by the inferior "and superior courts of judicature for the county of "Rockingham, in the above cause, so far as the same have relation "to the property specified in the claims of Elisha Doane, "Isaiah Doane, and James Shepherd, be, and the same are "hereby revoked, reversed, and annulled, and that the said property "specified in the said claims, be restored to the said claimants "respectively; and it is hereby ordered, that the parties to "the appeal each pay their own costs, which have accrued "in the prosecution of the said appeal in this court."</p>
<p>In this case considerable difficulty has arisen from the peculiar manner of pleading, which is said to be warranted by local practice, but which certainly has very much contributed to embarrass the question in the cause. There is neither a complete demurrer, nor, I conceive, a regular issue; and it may be deemed doubtful, whether what is termed a plea, ought to be considered as a plea or an answer. I had, therefore, at first strong doubts whether there was sufficient matter before us to ground a final decree: But upon reflection it seems to me, that as the case has been argued on both sides, upon a supposition that a final decree could be made; as there has been no application on either, for the examination of testimony, but the hearing took place without objection upon the pleadings as they stand, and consequently, we can regard the facts, only as stated on the record; as an express consent that the cause should be decided on this footing, would undoubtedly have been binding, and the circumstances in this case evidently prove an implied one; I think the pleadings as they stand, will afford sufficient foundation for a decree, especially according to those principles of practice, which we are told prevail in the state from which this record comes Â— a practice which, until altered, we undoubtedly ought to pursue, when it is not substantially inconsistent with justice.</p>
<p>Several objections have been offered (admitting the validity of the final decree, in respect to the authority of the court upon the points then before them) which I will consider in the best manner in my power. Â—</p>
<p>I. It is objected that the Appellant Doane was dead, before the final decision which was given in September, 1783; and this it is alledged, though not appearing on the face of the record, does appear from the letters of administration produced by the libellants, which letters are dated in February 1783.</p>
<p>Admitting that the courts are bound to inspect the date of the letters, and to regard that date as conclusive, and to infer the fact accordingly from it; several answers have been given to this objection; either of which, if valid, is decisive.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*101</span> 1. That the proceeding in question was a proceeding in rem, and upon such proceeding in civil law courts, the death of a party does not abate. I incline to think the law is so, but as my opinion is clear on other points in answer to the objection, I avoid giving an opinion on this.</p>
<p>2. That admitting the decree for this cause to be erroneous, it can only be avoided by a solemn proceeding in the nature of a proceeding in error, and cannot be enquired into in this collateral way.</p>
<p>Upon this point I am clear, that the decree was not rendered absolutely void, but must stand regularly good till reversed for this error, if it be one. So the matter stood while the court of appeals was in being. If the Appellees could have avoided the decree for this error, they might have applied to that court to have reviewed its decree upon this suggestion. The expiration of the court is no reason why the law in this particular should be considered as changed. It is true, in many cases where there has been error in a suit, and this has affected the right of a person not a party, this error has been admitted to be shewn in a suit where the point came collaterally in question. But it has never been permitted to a party who might have set aside the original judgment for error. I speak now of proceedings at common law. The same reason, I think, applies in this case. It does, indeed, seem reasonable, that if one party can proceed in the District Court to enforce the decree, the other party may to impeach it. But then this ought to be done in the same mode as in the other court, and that for a very substantial reason: Because, when that suggestion is the sole ground of enquiry, the other party may come prepared to shew many things to do away its force. He may (for aught I know) be permitted to shew a mistake in the date of the letters. He may shew an actual knowledge of the fact by the other party previous to the decree, and an acquiescence in it. He may possibly shew that the administrators were in fact before the court, though this does not appear on the face of the proceedings. As the enquiry in this case is into a fact, perhaps any thing of this kind may be shewn, and, is so, there surely ought to be an opportunity of doing it.</p>
<p>3. There seems great reason in what was alleged at the bar, that though it might have been competent for the administrators, had the decree been against Doane, to have shewn this fact for error, because neither the principal nor they had any opportunity of supporting their right before the court, when the decree was given, the former being dead, and the latter not being called upon, yet that it is not competent for the Appellees, who were before the court, were heard, and cannot allege (had that been the fact) that they had sustained any prejudice by their being heard ex parte.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*102</span> It is a rule at common law (the reason applies in equity and other civil law cases) that is a party can plead a fact, material to his defence, and omits to do it at the proper time, he can never avail himself of it afterwards.</p>
<p>They had a day in court to plead the death of the Appellant. If they say they did not know of it, the same might be alleged in any case at common law, where we know it will not avail. The law rather chuses that a party should incur a risque of this nature, than leave a door open to endless litigation upon pretences, the truth of which it is very difficult to discover.</p>
<p>4. This is an error in fact, and, in my opinion, it was a powerful argument, that if we cannot reverse a decree even of a District or Circuit Court for any error in fact, we have no ground to set aside the solemn and final decree of a court that has expired, for such an error. The argument, in my opinion, is altogether a fortiori.</p>
<p>II. The death of Doane has been alleged for another purpose.</p>
<p>It is said, that the decree is to restore to Elisha Doane, which was impossible, because Elisha Doane was not then in being. Admitting that upon this record we are to take judicial notice that Doane was dead at the time of pronouncing the decree (in which I am by no means clear) yet if this was the real reason why the Plaintiffs in error had withheld the property or its proceeds, they might themselves have said so. They have not, and as each party generally makes the best of his own case, we are to presume that did not in fact constitute their reason. In this case it could be of no avail, but at the utmost to prevent the allowance of interest until a demand actually made. It never could destroy the whole beneficial effect of a decree given in rem, and when the parties who make the objection were in court, and parties to the very decree complained of. I think nothing can be more evident, than that if the decree be not totally void, the administrators are entitled to the benefit of it, at least until it is set aside for error, is there be any error in it, and such a remedy is now practicable. If a scire facias was necessary before execution could have been obtained out of the court which passed the decree, it could be for no other reason than that the other party might have an opportunity to contest the validity of the letters, and the existence of the administration, if any such objection could be supported. Such an objection might have been made here. It has not been made. There is, therefore, I conceive, no principle of law or justice which forbids giving effect to the decree upon this ground.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*103</span> III. Another objection is, that the cause was not regularly brought up to the Court of Appeals, and proceeded on, agreeably to the resolutions of Congress.</p>
<p>There does not appear any ground for this objection in point of fact. But I am clear that this is a point not now enquirable into. When a court has final and exclusive jurisdiction in a case, and has pronounced a solemn judgment, every other court must presume that all their previous proceedings were right, of which indeed they were the only competent judges.</p>
<p>IV. It is alledged, damages were not prayed for by the libel. It is a sufficient answer, that there is a prayer for general relief. And so little do I think of this objection, and so much of the duty of a court, unaided by formal applications, where there is a substantial one, that I am strongly induced to think, if a case proper for a specific relief was laid before a civil law court, and the direct contrary to the proper relief was prayed for, yet the court even in this case would be justified in granting the relief that might be properly afforded, if the party who had committed the mistake consented to it: without that indeed it might be improper, for no court ought to force a benefit on a party unwilling to receive it.</p>
<p>These objections being all got over, which were urged against any relief whatsoever, it is necessary to consider the particular objections against the relief actually afforded. And here, I think, very formidable objections occur.</p>
<p>I think the decree erroneous in these particulars:</p>
<p>1. In decreeing interest for the time previous to the date of the decree in 1783.</p>
<p>2. In granting full damages against all the parties, without distinguishing between the owners to whom one half was distributed, and the agent who received the other half for the benefit of the officers, mariners and seamen.</p>
<p>3. In making George Wentworth, the agent, personally liable for any part.</p>
<p>1. As to the first point, as this libel proceeds only, and can be supported, as I conceive, upon no other ground, upon the principle of enforcing the decree of September 1783, so that the Libellants might recover such benefit from it as the nature of the case could admit, their case is not to be made better or worse, as to the original right, than as the Court of Appeals decided it.</p>
<p>The Court of Appeals might have decreed satisfaction for detention, but did not. They did not even decree costs, but ordered each party to pay his own costs. These things were altogether discretionary in the court. That was the proper court to judge, whether any damages should be allowed for detention. If the decree is to be final and conclusive as to the <span class="star-pagination">*104</span> subject matter, it must be so as completely in respect to the detention, which formed one part of the case, as to the restoration, which formed the principal object of it.</p>
<p>I should indeed have had some doubts as to the subsequent interest, had it appeared that the Defendants had been unable to comply substantially with the decree, owing to the death of Doane, and the want, (had that been the case) of a subsequent demand by the Administrators. But as that is not alleged, and they set up their whole defence upon the point of right, merely, we are not to presume, that those circumstances (if the Administrators did not make a demand, with respect to which nothing appears) had any weight in inducing their non-compliance with the decree.</p>
<p>2. I am of opinion, that damages against all the Defendants jointly, ought not to have been given. We are to look at substance, not form. There were, in effect, two decrees originally, one half of the value of the property to one party, the other half to another. The reversal of the decree ought to affect the decree itself, in the manner in which it was given. Consequently, each party ought only to be required to restore what he was adjudged to receive. The case of joint trespasses stated at the bar, does, in my opinion, by no means apply. The privateer in question, had a lawful commission. In the execution of such an authority, difficulties often arise. Where they happen, bona fide, the master is considered in no fault, and neither he nor his owners made accountable, even in case of a mistaken seizure, but for restoration, and, at the utmost, costs. In case of gross misbehaviour, not only costs, but damages will be allowed by the court of prize. It seems now to be settled that they have exclusive jurisdiction on all such subjects. As not even costs were allowed in this case, we are to infer that the seizure was prima facie innocent; consequently, if a principle of the common law, deemed by many highly rigorous, and founded, perhaps, rather on the forms of proceeding, than on strict justice, is those forms did not interfere, could be applied to a case arising in a court, not only authorised, but bound to distinguish between a mere mistake, and a wanton abuse of power, there is no foundation for such an application, in fact, in the present instance.</p>
<p>As owners are, in all instances, made jointly liable ex contractu, and their respective shares are matters of private cognizance, so that they, in all instances, appear jointly before the court, and a payment to one owner is, in law, a payment to all; I can discover no principle, upon which any discrimination could be properly made in this case, in regard to the different interests and actual receipts of the owners. I think, therefore, the decree in regard to one moiety, ought to be jointly against all the owners.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*105</span> 3 The third error in the decree, in my opinion, is, making George Wentworth, the agent, liable for any part. I have had considerable doubts on this subject, but upon the fullest consideration I have been able to bestow on it, I think he is not liable. Had he held any of the property, at the time of the decree of the Court of Appeals, he would have been undoubtedly liable. Had he any now, or any of the proceeds in his hands, he would also be liable. Perhaps he might, had he held any of the property or proceeds, after actual notice of the Court of Appeals taking cognizance of this case. Neither of these facts appears on the face of the record, and as they are of importance, and neither is asserted, neither is to be presumed. The contrary, indeed, may be fairly inferred from the statement on the record, and has been candidly acknowledged to be the real truth. He therefore appears in the character of a mere agent, acting avowedly for the benefit of others, and not for his own; and as he had paid away the money in virtue of a decree of a court, having prima facie authority for the time, to decide whether an appeal did, or did not lie; I think he ought not to be ordered to refund. It is alleged that the prayer of an appeal, in a case where an appeal lies, ipso facto, suspends the proceedings, and all afterwards is coram non judice. I cannot admit the doctrine in that extent. Where there are inferior and superior jurisdictions, and an appeal is allowed from the former to the latter, and it is the express duty of the party praying an appeal, to apply in the first instance, to the inferior court (as I conceive it was in this case under the resolutions of Congress, which directed an appeal to be prayed for within five days, and security to be taken) I must presume that that court is prima facie to judge whether it is applied for in a proper manner, and whether all the requisites previous to his being fully entitled to it, are complied with. If the court decides in any of these particulars erroneously, it would be absurd to say, that the party should lose the benefit of his appeal, but, in my opinion, it would be equally unjust to hold, that a party who obeyed the decree of a court, over whom he had no controul, should suffer by his respect to the law, which constituted that court, and which must therefore mean to support its decisions, in a cause coming within its jurisdiction, while they remain uncontrouled by any superior tribunal. It was shewn, that an inhibition, in cases of this kind, sometimes at least issues to forbid the court's further proceeding. Can there be a stronger proof, that the court had authority de facto (whatever may be said as to its authority de jure) without that interposition! The law never does a nugatory act, and therefore, I presume, would not forbid the doing of a thing, which if done, is totally and absolutely void. It was said, this was to bring the judge into contempt. <span class="star-pagination">*106</span> But if the conduct of the judge who is bound to know his jurisdiction is in the mean time innocent, surely an obedience to him by a party, who is not to be presumed capable of deciding on the jurisdiction by his own judgment, must be so. George Wentworth, on the face of the whole proceedings, was a more agent, an attorney in fact, and for aught I can fee, as little liable to refund in a case of this sort, as any attorney, in fact, or even an attorney at law, to whom money had been paid under a judgment or decree, and who had paid it away to his client. An agent in cases of this kind, is allowed by law. They are recognized, I believe, in all prize acts. Mariners, whose employment is on the sea, cannot be required without injustice to attend their cases in person. In cases of privateers, the captors are so numerous that the employment of one or more agents on shore, seems unavoidable. The law, when it allows a benefit, never intends that it shall be imperfectly enjoyed; therefore in allowing privateering, it allows agents. These I consider as nominal parties, and that the real parties are their principals. Now I will suppose that in a common law case an infant sues in a personal action by his guardian, and obtains a judgment; the guardian receives the money, and pays it to the infant after he comes of age. The judgment is afterwards reversed. Can the guardian ever be made to refund to the defendant, or must the person who was the infant do it? This case appears to me a very parallel one in all its circumstances. The infant cannot act for himself, and therefore is allowed to act by his guardian. The law takes notice, by allowing agents, that persons concerned in privateers, at least, cannot do well without them. The guardian is nominally a party; so is the agent: but the infant, in the one case, and the principals, in the other, are the real parties. The guardian is accountable to the infant, for money he received for him: so is the agent to the principal, for money he receives. There is, that I can imagine, but one difference, that can be suggested between them; that in the one case, the judgment is good till reversed; and, therefore, all lawful acts intermediately done, are valid. But the disallowance of the appeal, is said to be a nullity, and all subsequent proceedings in that court are void. I admit the consequence, if the law be so. But I have already stated reasons, why I think it is otherwise. A court of justice, indeed, ought at its peril to take notice of its own jurisdiction, and it is not often that cases of such doubt arise, that a Judge can be at a loss on the subject. But it may happen, and does sometimes happen, that innocent and serious doubts, are really entertained. Is a court, therefore, because its judgments may be finally diffented from, by a superior tribunal, to be considered as flying in the face of the law, so that parties before it, shall not <span class="star-pagination">*107</span> only be protected in disobeying it, but punished for their obedience? If this be the case, the old maxim, cedunt arma togÂœ, will very ill apply to Courts of Justice. Instead of being the peaceful arbiters of right, and the sacred asylum of unprotected innocence, their very forums will be the seat of war and confusion. I admit, indeed, where there is a conflict of jurisdiction, and the party entitled to a decree, is prohibited from obeying it, by a power claiming a superior cognizance, he must at his peril obey one or the other; but this arises from the absolute necessity of the case, because, whether the one or the other be right or wrong, must depend on a subsequent decision. In this case, George Wentworth, before the distribution, received no monition, or any other process from the tribunal alledged to be superior. He could not even be certain that the Appellants would carry their application further. I consider him, therefore, justifiable in obeying the decree, which at the time, was compulsory upon him, and for a disobedience to which, he might have been committed for a contempt, according to the opinion of the court which pronounced it. The parties still have their remedy against those who actually received the money, or their representatives, if they can be found. They may perhaps be entitled to a remedy under the bond gived, when the commission of the privateer was granted. If either of these remedies be difficult or inefficient, that does not make George Wentworth, in point of law, more liable than if they were perfectly easy, and clearly effectual. It will be one melancholy instance, in addition to a thousand others, of the distress incident to a doubtful and imperfect system of jurisprudence, which has been since happily changed for one so precise and so comprehensive, as to leave little room for such painful and destructive questions hereafter.</p>
<p>The 4th question is,</p>
<p>Whether this court can now rectify the decree in respect to the parts of it considered to be erroneous, or must affirm or reverse in the whole.</p>
<p>The latter is certainly the general method at common law, and it has been contended, that as this proceeding is on a writ of error, it must have all the incidents of a writ of error at common law. The argument would be conclusive, if this was a common law proceeding, but as it is not, I do not conceive, that it necessarily applies. An incident to one subject cannot be presumed, by the very name of such an incident, to be intended to apply to a subject totally different. I presume the term, "writ of error," was made use of, because we are prohibited from reviewing facts, and therefore must be confined to the errors on the record. But as this is a civil law proceeding, I conceive the word "error" must be applied to such errors <span class="star-pagination">*108</span> as are deemed such, by the principles of the civil law, and that in rectifying the error, we must proceed according to those principles. In a civil law court, I believe, it is the constant practice to modify a decree upon an appeal, as the justice of the case requires; and in this instance, it appears to me, under the 24th section of the judicial act, we are to render such a decree as, in our opinion, the District Court ought to have rendered. If this was a case, wherein damages were uncertain, and wherein for that reason, the cause should be remanded for a final decision, (which it does not appear to be, because the Libellants in the original suit had a decree in their favour, which is now to be affirmed in part) yet the damages here are not uncertain, because we all agree, that interest ought to be allowed from the date of the decree, in September, 1783, upon the value of the property, as specified in the report, against those who are to be adjudged to pay the principal.</p>
<p>Upon the whole, my opinion is, that the decree be affirmed in respect to the recovery of the Libellants, in the original action against all the Defendants but George Wentworth; that the libel against him, be adjudged to be dismissed; but that there be recovered against the other Defendants in the original action, the value of the property they received, as ascertained in the Circuit Court, with interest from the 17th of September, 1783.</p>
<p>I am also of opinion, that the respective parties should pay their own costs.</p>
<p>BLAIR, Justice.</p>
<p>When this cause came before me, at Exeter, in New Hampshire, I felt myself in a delicate situation, in having a cause of such magnitude, and at the same time, of such novelty and difficulty, as to have drawn the judgment of men of eminence, different ways, brought before me for my single decision. It was, however, a consolation to know, that whatever that decision might be, it was not intended to be final, and I can truly say, it will give me pleasure to have any errors I may have committed, corrected in this court. Two points, and if I mistake not, only two, were brought before me: The first, whether under the description of Admiralty and Maritime jurisdiction, the judiciary bill gave to the District Court any jurisdiction concerning prizes, I decided in the affirmative; and the same decision having been afterwards made in this court, in the case of Glasse, and others, I consider that as now settled. The other point, was, whether the Court of Appeals, erected by Congress, had authority to reverse the sentences given in the Courts of Admiralty of the several States; and the source of the objection upon this point, was the defect of authority in the Congress itself. Here, also, my sentence affirmed the jurisdiction.</p>
<p>I have attended as diligently, and as impartially as I could, <span class="star-pagination">*109</span> to the arguments of the gentlemen, upon the present occasion, to discover, if possible, how I may have been led astray, in the decision of this question; but as the impressions which my mind first received, continue uneffaced, (whether through the force of truth, or from the difficulty of changing opinions, once deliberately formed) I will repeat here the opinion which I delivered in the Circuit Court, as the best method I can take for explaining the reasons upon which it was founded. I would premise, however, that it contains something relative to what had been said at the bar of the Circuit Court, but which I believe was not mentioned on this occasion.</p>
<p>"The immediate question is, whether Congress had a right to exercise, by themselves, by their committees, or by any regular court of Appeals by them erected, an appellate jurisdiction, to affirm or reverse a sentence of a state court of Admiralty, in a question whether prize or no prize. If they possessed such an authority, it must be derivative, and its source either mediately or immediately the will of the people; usurpation can give no right. The respondents contend they had no such authority, till the completion of the Consideration in 1781, but only a recommendatory power; the Libellants insist, that Congress was considered as the sovereign power of war and peace, respecting Great-Britain, and that to that power is necessarily incident that of carrying on war in a regular way, of raising armies, making regulations for their discipline and government, commissioning officers, equipping slects, granting letters of marque and reprisal, the power (now contested) of deciding, in all cases of capture, questions whether prize or not, and every power necessarily incident to a state of war. It is, at least, certain, that the political situation of the American Colonies, required a union of council and of force, by wise measures to bring about, if possible, a reconciliation with the mother-country, on a basis of freedom and security, or, if this should fail, by vigorous measures to defeat the designs of their tyrannical invaders; and although this alone cannot suffice for an investiture in Congress, of the powers necessary to that end, yet if the powers given be delegated in terms large enough to comprehend this extent of authority, but which may also be satisfied by a more limited construction, the supposed necessity for such powers given to a federal head (and the counsel for the respondents have admitted that it would have been good policy) is no contemptible argument for supposing it actually given. In the beginning of the year 1775, our affairs were drawing fast to a crisis, and for some time before the battle of Lexington, a state of warfare must in the minds of all men have been an expected event. Some of the delagations (I think three) of members to the Congress which met in May of that year, <span class="star-pagination">*110</span> contain nothing but simple powers to meet Congress; the rest expressly give authority to their delagates to consent to all such further measures, as they and the said Congress shall think necessary, for obtaining a redress of American grievances, and a security of their rights. It is not in all of them worded alike, but in substance, that seems to be the sense. Every thing which may be deemed necessary! I think it cannot well be supposed, that in such a delegation of authority, at such a time, there was not an eye to war, if that should become necessary. But it is objected, that at most, no greater power was given to Congress than to enter into a definitive war with Great-Britain, not the right of war and peace generally; and even that war, till the declaration of independence, would be only a civil war. But why is not a definitive war against Great-Britain (call it if you will a civil war) to be conducted on the same principles as any other: If it was a civil war, still we do not allow it to have been a rebellion Â— America resisted and became thereby engaged in what the deemed a just war. It was not the war of a lawless banditti, but of freemen fighting for their dearest rights, and of men lovers of order and good government. Was it not as necessary in such a war, as in any between contending nations, that the law of nations should be observed, and that those who had the conducting of it, should be armed with every authority for preventing injuries to neutral powers, and their subjects, and even cruelty to the enemy? The power supposed to have been given to Congress, being confined to a definitive war against Great-Britain, and not extending to the rights of peace and war generally, appears to me to make no material difference; still the same necessity recurs, of confining the evil of the war to the enemy against whom it is waged. Till a formal declaration of independence the people of the Colonies are said to have continued subjects to Great-Britain; true, and that circumstance it is, which denominates the war a civil war, as to which I have already stated how, in my mind, the question is affected by that circumstance. But it was asked whether, if during the war, Great-Britain, at any time before the declaration of independence, had declared war against any nation of Europe, that nation would not have had a right to treat America with hostility as being subject to Great-Britain? According to this supposition, Great-Britain might have had some temptation to declare such war that she might have the co-operation of her enemy, to reduce her colonies to obedience. But Great-Britain was too wife to adopt such a policy; she knew that by her engaging in such a war, the colonies, instead of finding a new enemy to oppose, would have known where to find a friend; they might have formed an alliance with such a power, who probably would have considered it as an acquisition, <span class="star-pagination">*111</span> and Congress might have been the sooner encouraged to separate from Great-Britain, by a formal declaration of independence. As the supposition that Congress was invested with all the rights of war, in respect to Great-Britain, is of great moment in the present cause, and as the power may not be so satisfactorily conveyed by the instructions to the several delegates as might be wished, partly because some of them did not exhibit farther instructions than to attend Congress, and partly because the instructions given to the rest, may be satisfied by a different construction, it may be proper to consider the manner in which Congress, by their proceedings, appear to have considered their powers; not that by any thing of this fort, they had a right to extend their authority to the desired point, if it was not given, but because in shewing by such means, their sense of the extent of their power, they gave an opportunity to their constituents to express their disapprobation, if they conceived Congress to have usurped power, or by their co-operation to confirm the construction of Congress; which would be as legitimate a source of authority, as if it had been given at first. If they were only a mere council, to unite by their advice and recommendation all the States in the same common measures (which, by the by, if not uniformly pursued, might be disappointed) then the several members might be justly compared to ambassadors met in a Congress, and could only report their proceedings for the ratification of their principals; but Congress resolved to put the colonies in a state of defence; they raised an army, they appointed a commander in chief, with other general and field officers; they modelled the army, disposed of the troops, emitted bills of credit, pledged the confederated colonies for the redemption of them, and in short, acted in all respects like a body completely armed with all the powers of war; and at all this I find not the least symptom of discontent among all the confederated states, or the whole people of America; on the contrary, Congress were universally revered, and looked up to as our political fathers, and the faviours of their country. But if Congress possessed the right of war, they had also authority to equip a naval force; they did so, and exercised the fame authority over it, as they had done over the army; they passed a resolution for permitting the inhabitants of the colonies to fit out armed vessels to cruize against the enemies of America; directed what vessels should be subject to capture, and prescribed a rule of distribution of prizes, together with a form of commission, and instructions to the commanders of private ships of war: they directed that the general assemblies, conventions, and councils or committees of safety of the United Colonies, should be supplied with blank commissions, signed by the President of Congress, <span class="star-pagination">*112</span> to be by them filled up, and delivered to any person intending to fit out private ships of war, on his executing a bond, forms of which were to be sent with the commissions, and the bonds to be returned to Congress. These bonds are given to the President of Congress, in trust for the use of the United Colonies, with condition to conform to the commission and instructions. The commission, under which the Captain of the respondents acted, was one of these commissions, it seems, only this is attempted to be qualified by saying that it was countersigned by the Governor of New Hampshire; but this circumstance seems to me to be of no importance. Whoever has the right of commissioning and instructing, must certainly have the right of examining and controuling, of confirming or annulling the acts of him who accepts the commission, and acts under it. And this exercise of authority in granting commissions seems to have had the special sanction of the several colonies, as they filled up the commissions, took the bonds, and transmitted them to Congress. It was urged in the course of the argument, that if Congress did enjoy the power contended for, the confederation, which was a thing of such long and anxious expectation, was not of any consequence; but it is to be observed, that that instrument contained some important powers which could not be derived from the right of war and peace; it was of importance also, as a confirmation of the powers claimed as necessarily incident to war, because some of the states appeared not to be sensible of, nor to have acknowledged such incidency; and yet the power may have existed before. It is true, that instrument is worded in a manner, on which some stress has been laid, that the several States should retain their sovereignties, and all powers not thereby expressly delegated to Congress, as if they were, till the ratification of that compact, in possession of all the powers thereby delegated; but it seems to me, that it would be going too far, from a single expression, used perhaps in a loose sense, to draw an inference so contrary to a known fact, to wit, that Congress was, with the approbation of the states, in possession of some of the powers there mentioned, which yet, if the word `retain' be taken in so strict a sense, it must be supposed they never had. I take the truth to be, that the framers of that instrument were contemplating what powers Congress ought to have had at the beginning; and that in reference to the first occasion of their assembling to oppose the tyranny of Great Brittain, at least in reference to the time of framing the confederation, say, the states shall retain. But however that may be, as I said before, I think it is laying too great a stress upon a single word, to contradict some things which were evidently true.</p>
<p>"But it was said that New Hampshire had a right to revoke <span class="star-pagination">*113</span> any authority she may have consented to give to Congress, and that by her acts of assembly she did in fact revoke it, if it were ever given. To this a very satisfactory answer was made: if she had such a right, there was but one way of exercising it, that is, by withdrawing herself from the confederacy; while she continued a member, and had representative in Congress, she was certainly bound by the acts of Congress. I am therefore of opinion that those acts of New Hampshire, which restrain the jurisdiction of Congress, being contrary to the legitimate powers of Congress, can have no binding force, and that under the authority of Congress an appeal well lay from the Courts of Admiralty of that State, to the Court of Commissioners of Appeals. That Court has already affirmed their jurisdiction in this particular case, upon a plea put in against it; and upon that account, also, I incline to think that this court, not being a court of superior authority, ought not to call it in question. Under these impressions, I must, of course, decree (whatever may be the hardship of the case) that the Respondents, pay to the Libellants, their damages and costs, occasioned by not complying with the decree of the Court of Appeals, the quantum of which to be ascertained by Commissioners."</p>
<p>If the reasoning upon which I went, in pronouncing the above decree, in favour of the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals, be unsound, and if the decree stand in need of some better support, it will probably find it in the consederation, by which authority is given to Congress, to erect Courts of Appeal in all cases; and from that time the authority of the court of Appeals is confessed; the present case was then depending before that court, they asserted their jurisdiction, and gave a final decree. As to the objection, that previously to the consederation, Congress were themselves sensible, that they did not possess supreme Admiralty jurisdiction, because of their recommending to the several States, that they should erect Courts of Admiralty, for the trial of prizes, with appeal to Congress, I fee not how such recommendations can prove any thing of the kind; for Congress might have authority to establish such courts in the respective States, when yet they chose only to recommend to the states to do it. But admitting the authority of the Court of Appeals, and the propriety of applying to the District Court of New Hampshire, to inforce that decree in the way of damages, for not restoring the vessel and cargo, when through the disobedience of the present Plaintiffs in error, specific restitution was become impossible, yet if any thing erroneous can be found in the decree of the Circuit Court, it is the duty of this court to correct it. It is objected, that the damages allowed, were too high, including interest on the appreciation <span class="star-pagination">*114</span> of the Susanna and her cargo, from so remote a period as the sale of the vessel and cargo.</p>
<p>That George Wentworth, being a mere agent, and having distributed among those who were entitled, under the decrees of the Courts of Admiralty of New Hampshire, all the money by him received for their use, ought not to have been subjected by the decree of the Circuit Court, to the repayment of that money.</p>
<p>And that a lumping decree, subjecting the Respondents indiscriminately, to the payment of all the damages, although their interests were several and distinct, was also erroneous.</p>
<p>It does not, indeed, appear to me, that the decree is for the payment of too large a sum, the damages having been swelled by interest, calculated upon the appraised value of the Susanna, her apparel, and of her cargo, from so remote a period. The decree of the Court of Appeals was merely for restitution, and that the Appellants should be placed at that time in the same situation as they were in, previous to the capture. A compensation for the loss they sustained in being in the mean time deprived of their property, was not provided for in the decree, nor were even costs allowed. The libel in the Circuit Court being bottomed on the decree of reversal, sought only a compensation in damages equivalent to a restitution at the time of the reversal: Interest, therefore, ought, I think, to have been allowed only from that time.</p>
<p>George Wentworth, it is true, was not concerned in interest; he represented the interest of the officers and seamen, but had none himself; and a mere agent who has paid away all, or any part of the money by him received in that character, without having been by a monition notified of the appeal, will be allowed credit in his account for the money so paid away. But George Wentworth appears, I think, in another character besides that of an agent: he was a party libellant, as such he knew that the Claimants were dissatisfied with the decrees of the Admiralty Courts of New Hampshire, having prayed an appeal to Congress, and offered the requisite security; and when the petition of appeal was referred to the Court of Commissioners, and they directed notice to be given to the parties, who appeared before that court, it seems evident that they had notice. What then is the effect of this? Was any thing further necessary to suspend the decrees of the State Courts? An inhibition is, indeed, worded in a manner naturally leading to the supposition, that that instrument was necessary to effect a suspension; but this, I think, cannot be the case; for, it is observable, that by the practice, an interval of three months is allowed before the inhibition is sued out, in which time, if nothing had antecedently suspended the sentence, it might be carried <span class="star-pagination">*115</span> into complete effect, and every body be justified in their conduct, as paying obedience to a decree continuing in full force. The inhibition may be intended only as a more formal direction to cease farther proceedings, when yet they may have been inhibited before: it has a farther use also, for it appoints a day for the attendance of the parties. Conformably to this idea, it is said, in Domat, that the appeal suspends the decree. But a distinction is attempted here; it is admitted that an appeal allowed by the inferior court, suspends, while an appeal received by a superior court, is denied to have that effect. But according to Domat, it works a suspension, even against the will of the inferior Judge; and it would be very strange, if the suspending operation of an appeal, to a Judge who has an authority to reverse, should depend upon the consent of the inferior Judge. But if the sentences of the State Courts were indeed suspended, no person had authority to act under them; and if any do, he takes upon himself the consequences. Besides, if George Wentworth had innocently and without notice, distributed the money which came to his hands, should not this have been shewn to the Court of Appeals? If that had been done, perhaps after reversing the decrees of the State Court, instead of decreeing restitution, they might have only decreed that the owners should pay to the Appellants, the moiety of the sales by them received. But they have decreed restitution specifically; and if this court should so model the decree of the Circuit Court, as to exonerate Mr. Wentworth, as to the moiety of the money by him received, it will substantially alter the decree of the Court of Appeals; and yet we say, that the decree now is to be bottomed on that of the Court of Appeals, which is now to be supposed right; and that for that reason it was erroneous in the Circuit Court, to carry interest farther back than from the period of reversal, and in this way give damages, which were not intended by the Court of Appeals.</p>
<p>The decree of the Circuit Court, appears now, I confess, to be wrong, in that it subjects all the Defendants, indiscriminately, to the payment of all the damages. In the original libel, they had indeed joined, but it was in right of several interests, which I think ought to have been distinguished in the decree; justice obviously requires this; so obviously, that it is enough to state the case to obtain the mind's assent to the propriety of distributive damages, instead of those which the decree contemplates. I will only say further, that I have no remembrance of having had this point brought to my view at the Circuit Court, and it certainly did not occur to myself; but if any thing was said upon the point, and I, with deliberation; then preferred the decree as it stands, I am clearly now, of a different opinion. Upon the whole, I think the decree of the <span class="star-pagination">*116</span> Circuit Court will stand as it ought, when corrected by reducing the damages in the manner proposed, and when so reduced, by proportioning them among the then Defendants, according to their distinct interests.</p>
<p>CUSHING, Justice.</p>
<p>The facts of this case being already fully stated by the court, I shall go on to enquire, whether the decree of the Circuit Court ought to be reversed, for any of the errors assigned.</p>
<p>The first is, that the Court of Appeals, which made the decree of restoration, had not jurisdiction of the cause.</p>
<p>In answer to this, I concur with the rest of the court, that the Court of Appeals, being a court under the confederation of 1781, of all the states, and being a court for "determining finally, appeals in all cases of capture," and so being the highest court, the dernier resort in all such cases, their decision upon the jurisdiction and upon the merits of the cause, having heard the parties by their council, must be final and conclusive, to this, and all other courts: to this, as a Court of Admiralty, because it is a court of the same kind, as far as relates to prize, and without any controuling or revisionary powers over it; to this as a court of common law, because it is entirely a prize-matter, and not of common law cognizance. The cases, therefore, cited to shew, that the common law is of general jurisdiction, and that the court of King's bench, prohibits, controuls, and keeps within their line, Admiralty Courts, Spiritual Courts, and other courts of a special, limited jurisdiction, do not, I conceive, touch this case.</p>
<p>It is conceded by all, that the decision of a court competent is final and binding. Now, if the Court of Appeals was, under the consederation of all the states, a court constituted "for determining finally appeals in all cases of capture," it was a court competent; and they have decided. Again, the Admiralty of England gives credence and force to the decisions of foreign courts of Admiralty; why not equal reason here?</p>
<p>It is true, the courts of common law there, will not allow a greater latitude to the jurisdiction of foreign courts of Admiralty, than to their own; as it seems natural and reasonable, they should not; for instance, holding plea of a contract made entirely at land, which seems to have been the substantial ground of a prohibition, in the case cited, respecting the decree in Spain.</p>
<p>If the decree of the court of Appeals must he considered as binding, as it must, or there may never be an end to this controversy; that will carry an answer to several other errors assigned, viz. the third, fifth, and seventh, respecting the cause not being regularly before Congress or the court, and respecting the Circuit Court not entering into the merits Â— and to <span class="star-pagination">*117</span> some other particular exceptions; as, that appealing to the Superior Court of New-Hampshire, was a waver of the right of appeal to Congress: If that appeal was consistent with the resolve of Congress, which only provided an appeal to Congress in the last resort, it was not a waver. Again, it is said, there ought to have been a jury at the Court of Appeals; but that, clearly, was not the intent of the resolve of Congress, nor of the Consederation, nor correspondent to the proceedings in courts of Admiralty, even where trials by jury are used and accustomed in other matters; nor was it thought a proper or necessary provision in the present constitution, which has been adopted by the people of the United States.</p>
<p>As to the original question of the powers of Congress, respecting captures, much has been well and eloquently said on both sides. I have no doubt of the sovereignty of the states, saving the power delegated to Congress, being such as were, "proper and necessary" to carry on, unitedly, the common defence in the open war, that was waged against this country, and in support of their liberties to the end of the contest.</p>
<p>But, as has been said, I conceive we are concluded upon that point, by a final decision heretofore made.</p>
<p>The 2d exception in error is, that the sentence of the Court of Appeals was void by the death of Mr. Doane.</p>
<p>That fact does not appear upon the record of the Court of Appeals, and I think we cannot reverse the decree in this incidental way, if it could be done upon a writ of error. If it was pleadable in abatement, it ought to have been pleaded or suggested there by the opposite party.</p>
<p>On the contrary, it is implied by the record, that Doane was alive; otherwise he could not have been heard by his council as the record sets forth; for a dead man could not have council or attorney. On the other hand, the letters of administration imply that he was dead at the time; but those letters were not before the court, and therefore could not be a ground for their abating the suit, if it was abateable at all for such a cause. Here seems to be record against record, as far as implications go, and I take it to be an error in fact, for which, by the judicial act, there is to be no reversal. Upon this head, a case in Sir Thos. Raymond, is cited by the council for the Plaintiff in error, of trover by five plaintiffs Â— one dies Â— the rest proceed to verdict and judgment Â— and adjudged error, because every man is to recover according to the right he has at the time of bringing the action; and here each one was not, at the time of bringing the action, entitled to so much as at the death of one of the plaintiffs.</p>
<p>But a case in Chancery Cases, p. 122, is more in point Â— where money was made payable by the decree to a man that <span class="star-pagination">*118</span> was dead, and yet adjudged, among other things, no error. But another matter, which seems well to rule this case, is, that, being a suit in rem, death does not abate it.</p>
<p>So say some books, and I do not remember to have heard any to the contrary. It does not affect the justice of the cause; it makes no odds to the plaintiff in error, whether the money is to be paid to Colonel Doane being alive, or to his legal representatives, if dead.</p>
<p>The 4th exception, that damages are not prayed for, yet decreed, is answered by a prayer for general relief.</p>
<p>The 8th exception is, that the District and Circuit Court possessed not admiralty jurisdiction, and that the Circuit Court had no right to carry the decree into execution.</p>
<p>If courts of Admiralty can carry into execution decrees of foreign Admiralties, as seems to be settled law and usage; and if the District and Circuit Courts, have admiralty powers by the law and constitution, as was adjudged and determined by this court last February, I think there can be no doubt upon this point</p>
<p>Another question of consequence is, whether Mr. George Wentworth, being agent for the captors, and having paid over, can be answerable jointly with the other libellants for the whole, or, in any way, for any part. If it was simply the case of an agent regularly paying over, I should suppose he could not justly be called upon to refund. But it seems he was an original libellant, a party through the whole course of the suit; and an appeal being claimed in time, at the court and term, at which the libellants obtained the decree (of which, therefore, he had legal notice) the appeal, if a lawful one, in my opinion, suspended the sentence and must make him answerable for whatever monies he should receive under that decree, in case of reversal: every man being bound to take notice of the law, at his peril.</p>
<p>It is suggested, that an inhibition was necessary to take off the force of the sentence. An inhibition (according to the form of one produced, which issued in England last July, near four months after the trial and appeal at New-Providence inhibits the judge and the party from doing any thing in prejudice of the appeal, or of the jurisdiction of the court appealed to, and cites the party to appear and answer the party appellant, at a certain time and place. The citation to the party to appear and answer at the proper time and place, I take to be the most substantial part of the process; the inhibitory part to be rather matter of form, or in pursuance of the suspending nature of the appeal, and as a further guard and caution against mis-applying the property. For it appears to me absurd to suppose, that an inhibition taken out seven or eight months after the <span class="star-pagination">*119</span> appeal (nine months being allowed for the pnrpose) should be the only thing that suspended the sentence, leaving the judge below and the party, all that time, to carry the sentence into compleat execution.</p>
<p>The judicial act in providing an appeal in maritime causes to the Circuit Court, contains no hint of an inhibition as necessary to suspend the sentence. Domat is express, that an appeal has that effect, and I believe other civil law writers.</p>
<p>The rejection of the appeal, if unwarranted, could not take away the right of the citizen.</p>
<p>There does not appear any thing actually compulsory upon Mr. George Wentworth, to pay the money, except what may be supposed to be contained in the decree appealed from, the force of which was suspended. All this matter might have been offered at the Court of appeals, where the parties were fully heard, and, if offered, was, no doubt, involved in their decision.</p>
<p>It is said, if I understood the matter right, that there ought to have been a monition from the Circuit Court to Mr. Wentworth, to bring in what he had in his hands.</p>
<p>I see no necessity for a monition exactly in that form. There was a monition to come in and answer the libellants upon the justice of the cause, as set forth; Â— he came in and had an opportunity to defend himself: and the question was, whether he was answerable upon the circumstances of the case, which was determined by the court.</p>
<p>By the cases in Durnford and East, as well as from other books, it is clear that the admiralty has not only jurisdiction in rem, but also power over the persons of the captors and all those who have come to the possession of the proceeds of the prize, to do complete justice as the case requires, to captors and claimants.</p>
<p>But I cannot conceive why the decree of the court of appeals is not conclusive upon Mr. George Wentworth as much as upon the other libellants.</p>
<p>Again; it is objected, that the decree being for restoration, damages could not be awarded. The decree was not complied with Â— the thing was gone. How, then, could justice be done without giving damages?</p>
<p>Then the question is, how are we to understand the decree; as joint upon all the libellants for thewhole, Mr. George Wentworth included, or as decreeing the owners to restore one half, and Mr. George Wentworth, agent for the captors, the other half?</p>
<p>If the latter, which perhaps may be a reasonable and just construction, conformable to the spirit of the original libel, then the decree of the Circuit Court is in that respect erroneous. <span class="star-pagination">*120</span> Also as to damages, I suppose, interest ought not to have been allowed farther back than the decree. The only question that remains, is whether this court can rectify those errors, consistently with the judicial act. And I think it may, as there is sufficient matter, apparent upon the record, to do it by.</p>
<p>I agree that each party bear their own costs of this court.</p>
<p>BY THE COURT. Ordered, That against all the Plaintiffs in error, except George Wentworth, sixteen thousand three hundred and sixty dollars and sixty-eight cents, be recovered by the Defendants in error, and the same sum against George Wentworth; and that against the Plaintiffs in error the costs of the Circuit Court be recovered, one half against George Wentworth, and the other half against the other Plaintiffs in error; and that in this Court the parties pay their own costs.</p>

<p>For the Plaintiff in Error.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*32</span> On the 27th of February, the Court delivered their opinion to the following effect.</p>
<p>PATTERSON, Justice.</p>
<p>Considering, as I do, that all the papers transmitted from the Circuit Court, upon a return to the writ of error, form a part of the record in this cause, I am clearly of opinion, that the subject matter of the controversy, is fully and exclusively of Admiralty jurisdiction.</p>
<p>IREDELL, Justice.</p>
<p>I find it difficult, to form an opinion on the question of jurisdiction, at this stage of the cause. I concur in thinking, however, that all the papers, which accompany the record, should be considered as a part of it; and, in relation to the original suit, it appears to me, that on the evidence exhibited by Mr. Bingham, to shew that he acted under the orders of the Marquis de Bouille, the Judge should have charged, and the jury should have found, that he was not responsible to the plaintiffs.</p>
<p>But, still, I am not ready at this moment to decide, that <span class="star-pagination">*33</span> the Circuit Court had no jurisdiction. Suppose the Plaintiffs below had expressly stated in their declaration, that their cause of action was a capture as prize; the court would, probably, have directed a nonsuit; and yet, if the Plaintiffs had persisted in answering when called, the jury must have given a verdict. Suppose, again, that the controversy had appeared from the Defendant's evidence to turn entirely upon the question of prize, the court could not, I conceive (though I speak here with great diffidence) direct the Plaintiffs to be nonsuited, merely on the Defendant's evidence; and, unless a juror had been withdrawn by consent, a verdict must, also, have been given in this event. It will not be sufficient to remark, that the court might charge the jury to find for the Defendant; because, though the jury will generally respect the sentiments of the court on points of law, they are not bound to deliver a verdict conformably to them. From these, and other considerations, I do not find myself at liberty to decide against the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court; though, I repeat, that the jury ought to have been let in to give a verdict in favor of the Defendant.</p>
<p>WILSON, Justice.</p>
<p>From the proceedings laid before the Court, it appears clearly to my mind, that the question, on which the cause must be decided, is exclusively of Admiralty jurisdiction.</p>
<p>CUSHING, Justice.</p>
<p>It does not appear to me, from any part of the record, that the Circuit Court had not jurisdiction on the third Count in the declaration. The papers and depositions that have been transmitted, were, no doubt, produced upon the trial; and, I agree, that they ought to be regarded as a part of the record. But we are not bound to receive for truth, every thing which they alledge; nor, indeed, can we give any of their statements the validity and force of a fact; since, they only amount to evidence; and it is the peculiar and exclusive province of the jury to infer facts from the evidence.</p>
<p>That the court had not jurisdiction on those Counts, which seem to refer to a question of prize, is no reason for excluding a jurisdiction upon the Count, which has no such reference. The contract might be of a different nature; and the parol testimony (which does not appear, in any shape, on the record) might have supported it.</p>
<p>THE COURT, being thus equally divided in their opinions, on the exception to the jurisdiction, directed the Counsel to proceed to the discussion of</p>
<p>II. The Exceptions to the Record.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*39</span> The Judges, after some advisement, delivered their opinions, Seriasim.</p>
<p>PATTERSON, Justice.</p>
<p>I am clearly of opinion, that the certificate of the Marquis de Bouille, registered in the Admiralty of Martinique, ought to have been admitted as evidence upon the trial of this cause. He was Governor of the Island, possessing a high executive and superintending controul; and we must presume, that he acted, on this occasion, with legitimate authority.</p>
<p>Those letters which were written to Congress by Mr. Bingham, at the time of the transaction, should, likewise, in my opinion, have been submitted to the Jury. On the arrival of the captured vessel, the Governor might have awarded absolute restitution: but, chusing to adopt a middle course, he directed the cargo to be sold, and the proceeds to remain in the hands of Mr. Bingham, as the Agent of Congress, till Congress should instruct him how to act. In the character of a public agent, therefore, Mr. Bingham received the property; and his cotemporaneous correspondence on the subject, in that character, with the American government, was, certainly, proper evidence, to shew the original nature and complexion of the facts in controversy. I have more doubts on the admissibility of the other letters referred to in the Bill of Exceptions; but, in relation to them, it is unnecessary to give a decided opinion.</p>
<p>With respect to the Resolutions of Congress, two questions may be proposed, in order to determine, whether they ought to have been admitted as evidence: I. Had Congress authority <span class="star-pagination">*40</span> to pass such Resolutions? and 2. Did the Resolutions relate to the subject of the controversy? I have lately had occasion, in the case of Doane versus Penhallow<sup>[*]</sup>, to express my sentiments at large on the authority of Congress (of which, in its application to the present object, I do not entertain the slightest doubt) And no man of common candour can hesitate, for a moment, to pronounce, that the Resolutions have an immediate and necessary connection with the merits of the cause. They ought, then, to have been admitted; but what should be their force and operation, is another point, not, at present, before the Court.</p>
<p>I am, also, of opinion, that it was improper to reject the Depositions, which Mr. Bingham had taken, in his public, official, character, to ascertain the circumstances of the capture, and the property of the vessel and cargo, at the time the supposed prize was carried into Martinique.</p>
<p>IREDELL, Justice.</p>
<p>It appears satisfactorily to me, that many of the documents offered in evidence, have been improperly rejected. From an inspection of all the papers, which are attached to the Record, the nature of the dispute may be easily ascertained. The Plaintiffs alledge that Mr. Bingham received, on their account, as their agent, property which had been captured by them as prize; and that, whether the capture was lawful, or not, he was bound to account to them, though they might be responsible to the original owners, if any wrong had been committed. To this charge, Mr. Bingham answers, that he never was the Agent of the Plaintiffs, but a Public Agent; and that he did not receive the property from them on their account; but from the Marquis de Bouille, on account of the true owners. Admitting either of these positions, a direct and certain consequence will insue. If the Plaintiffs are right, the consequence is, that Mr. Bingham ought to surrender the prize property, or account for its proceeds, to them; and though they, as captors, may be sued by the neutral claimants, the existence of a neutral claim will not justify his refusal so to surrender, or account. But, if the Defendant is right, the consequence is, that he ought not to deliver up the property to the Plaintiffs until it has been ascertained that the capture was lawful, which must be done through the medium of a Prize Court, not by a Judgment in a Court of common law. From this view of the controversy, therefore, it must be of great moment that Mr. Bingham should have an opportunity to shew, that he had acted, throughout the business, as the Public Agent of the United <span class="star-pagination">*41</span> States; and that his communications to Congress were open, fair, and faithful. If, indeed, he had given parol testimony on these points, his opponents might have called for the records of the appointment and correspondence, as affording higher proof. I am, therefore, of opinion, that Mr. Bingham's official letters, (some of which were written before any dispute existed, or could reasonably be anticipated) ought not to have been rejected.</p>
<p>The Resolutions of Congress, likewife, were proper evidence; Â— not, indeed, to prove, that the Plaintiffs were not entitled to the money in question, but to prove that the Defendant was recognized in the transaction as the Agent of Congress. The Resolutions are not to be considered as the mere expression of a Congressional opinion, but as an acknowledgment that Mr. Bingham was a public agent, and that the public, as his principal, was accountable for the money.</p>
<p>The certificate of the Marquis de Bouille, whether regarded as an original order, or as the evidence of a parol order, previously given, ought to have been laid before the jury. The Marquis acted officially, as Governor and Commander in Chief; and we must presume, that he exercised a lawful authority, in a lawful manner.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances it only remains to consider, what course should be pursued by the Court, in order to give the Defendant the benefit of a trial, upon a full view of his legal proofs. I think, for that purpose, that a Venire Facias de novo ought to issue. For, although a Court of common law has no jurisdiction of the question of prize; yet, whether it is necessary in the present case to determine that question, must depend upon the facts, which are established at the trial. On a Count for money had and received, &amp;c. the Court below has, prima facie, jurisdiction; and if the jury shall think Mr. Bingham was merely the agent of the Plaintiffs, the validity of the capture, as prize, can form no ingredient in deciding the issue. If, on the contrary, the jury shall think Mr. Bingham acted as a public agent, their verdict must be in his favour; as he was bound to keep the property for the real owners; and the captors can never show that they are the real owners, until the vessel and cargo have been condemned as prize, by a competent tribunal. The captors may then proceed against Mr. Bingham in a Court of Admiralty, whose decree of condemnation, operating against all the world, would entitle the captors to receive the money, and justify Mr. Bingham, or Congress, in paying it.</p>
<p>WILSON, Justice.</p>
<p>In several instances, I concur in the sentiments, that have been delivered by the Judges, who have preceded me; but, I think, it is unnecessary to specify the particulars, <span class="star-pagination">*42</span> or to amplify the reasons, since I continue clearly in my opinion on the point, which was separately argued, that this cause is exclusively of Admiralty jurisdiction. On that ground I chuse entirely to rest the judgment that I give: but it leads inevitably, also, to another conclusion, that, the Court not having jurisdiction, a Venire Facias de novo (which, in effect, directs the exercise of jurisdiction) ought not to issue. I am, therefore, for pronouncing, simply, a judgment of reversal.</p>
<p>PATERSON, Justice.</p>
<p>I cannot agree to send a Venire Facias de novo to a Court, which, in my opinion, has no jurisdiction to try, or to decide, the cause.</p>
<p>CUSHING, Justice.</p>
<p>I shall give no opinion upon the question of affirming, or reversing, the Judgment of the Court below. My brethren think there is error in the proceedings; and they are right to rectify it. On the question, however, of awarding a Venire Facias de novo, I agree with Judge IREDELL: But, as the Court are equally divided, the Writ cannot issue.</p>
<p>Judgment reversed; but no writ of Venire Facias de novo was awarded.</p>

<p>The Prohibition issued, accordingly, in the following form:</p>
<p>"UNITED STATES, ss.</p>
<p>THE PRESIDENT of the UNITED STATES to the honorable RICHARD PETERS, Esquire, Judge of the District Court of the United States, in and for the Pennsylvania district: It is shewn to the Judges of the Supreme Court of the United States, by Samuel B. Davis, That whereas by the laws of nations, and the treaties subsisting between the United States and the Republic of France, the trial of prizes taken on the high seas, without the territorial limits and jurisdiction of the United States, and brought within the dominions and jurisdiction of the said Republic, for legal adjudication, by vessels of war belonging to the sovereignty of the said Republic, acting under the same, and of all questions incidental thereto, does of right, and exclusively, belong to the tribunals and judiciary establishments of the said Republic, and to no other tribunal, or tribunals, court, or courts, whatsoever: And whereas by the said law of nations, and treaties aforesaid, the vessels of war belonging to the said French Republic, and the officers commanding the same, cannot, and ought not, to be arrested, <span class="star-pagination">*130</span> seized, attached, or detained, in the ports of the United States, by process of law, at the suit or instance of individuals, to answer for any capture or captures, seizure or seizures, made on the high seas, and brought for legal adjudication into the ports of the French Republic, by the said vessels of war, while belonging to, and acting under the authority and in the immediate service of the said Republic: And whereas bythe laws and treaties aforesaid, the District Courts of the United States have not, and ought not, to entertain jurisdiction or hold plea of such captures, made as aforesaid, under the above circumstances: And whereas by the laws of nations, the vessels of war of belligerent powers, duly by them authorized, to cruize against their enemies, and to make prize of their ships and goods, may, in time of war, arrest and seize the vessels belonging to the subjects or citizens of neutral nations, and bring them into the ports of the sovereign under whose commission and authority they act, there to answer for any breaches of the laws of nations, concerning the navigation of neutral ships, in time of war; and the said vessels of war, their commanders, officers and crews, are not amenable before the tribunals of neutral powers for their conduct therein, but are only answerable to the sovereign in whose immediate service they were, and from whom they derived their authority: And whereas, on or before the twentieth day of May, now last past, the said Samuel B. Davis, was, and now is, a Lieutenant of ships in the navy of the said French Republic, and commander of a corvette, or vessel of war, called the Cassius, then, and now, the property of the said Republic, and in her immediate service; and on the said twentieth day of May, was duly commissioned, by and under the authority of the said Republic, to cruize against her enemies, and make prize of their ships (as by his commission and the certificate of the minister plenipotentiary of the said Republic to the United States, to the court shewn, more fully appears) Nevertheless a certain James Yard, of the city of Philadelphia, merchant, not ignorant of the premises, but contriving and intending to disturb the peace and harmony subsisting between the United States and the French Republic, and him, the said Samuel B. Davis, wrongfully to aggrieve and oppress, and draw to another proof, him, the said Samuel B. Davis, and the said corvette, or vessel of war, of the French Republic, the Cassius, in the port of Philadelphia, under the protection of the laws of nations, and of the faith of treaties, has, by process out of the District Court of the United States, in and for the District of Pennsylvania, attached and arrested him, the said Samuel B. Davis, and the said corvette, or vessel of war, the Cassius, before the Judge of the said District Court, contrary to the said law of nations, and treaties, and <span class="star-pagination">*131</span> against the due form of the laws of the United States, hath unjustly drawn in plea, to answer to a certain libel, by him, the said James Yard, against him, the said Samuel B. Davis, and against the said corvette, or vessel of war, the Cassius, her tackle, apparel, and furniture, exhibited and promoted, craftily and subtilly therein alledging, articulating, and objecting, that on the said twentieth day of May, now last past, the said Samuel B. Davis, then commander of the said corvette, or vessel, the Cassius, did, forcibly, violently, and tortiously, take on the high seas, a certain schooner, or vessel, belonging to the said James Yard, called the William Lindsey, and brought her into Port de Paix, (in the dominion of the French Republic) where she still remains; and also alledging and articulating, that the said corvette, or vessel called the Cassius, was originally equipped and fitted for war, in the port of Philadelphia, in the United States, and that the said Samuel B. Davis, was at the time of the said capture, and now is, a citizen of the United States: Without this, however, and the said James Yard, not in any manner alledging, or articulating, that the said capture was made, within the territory, rivers, or bays, of the United States, or within in a marine league of the coast thereof, or that the said corvette or vessel, the Cassius, was so fitted or equipped for war in the United States, by the said French Republic, her agent, or agents, with their knowledge, or by the means, or procurement, or by the said Samuel B. Davis, or that at the time of her being so equipped, or fitted for war, in the United States, (if ever there she was so in any manner fitted or equipped) she was the property of the said French Republic, or that the said Samuel B. Davis was in any manner, in the said equipment, or sitting for war, concerned; and without this, also, and the said James Yard, not in any manner alledging, that the said Samuel B. Davis was retained, or engaged, in the service of the French Republic, within the territory or jurisdiction of the United States: And that the said James Yard, him, the said Samuel B. Davis, and the said corvette, or vessel of war, called the Cassius, by force of the process aforesaid, out of the said District Court, had and obtained, as aforesaid, still wrongfully detains, and the said Samuel B. Davis, and the French Republic, owner of the said corvette, or vessel of war, thereupon in the said District Court to answer, and in the premises, cause to be condemned, with all his power, endeavours, and daily contrives, in contempt of the government of the United States, against the laws of nations, and the treaties subsisting between the United States and the French Republic, and against the laws and customs of the United States, to the manifest violation of the law of nations, and treaties, and to the manifest disturbance of the peace and harmony happily subsisting between the <span class="star-pagination">*132</span> United States and the French Republic: Wherefore the said Samuel B. Davis, the aid of the said Supreme Court most respectfully requesting, hath prayed remedy by a writ of prohibition, to be issued out of the said Supreme Court, to you to be directed, do prohibit you from holding the plea aforesaid, the premises aforesaid any wife concerning, further before you: Â— You, therefore, are hereby prohibited, that you no further hold the plea aforesaid, the premises aforesaid in any wife touching, before you, nor any thing in the said District Court attempt, nor procure to be done, which may be in any wife to the prejudice of the said Samuel B. Davis, or the said corvette, or vessel of war, called the Cassius; or in contempt of the laws of the United States: And also, that from all proceedings thereon you do, without delay, release the said Samuel B. Davis, and the said corvette, or vessel of war, called the Cassius, at your peril.</p>
<p>WITNESS, the honorable JOHN RUTLEDGE, Esquire, Chief Justice of the said Supreme Court, at Philadelphia, this 24th day of August, in the year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and ninety-five, and of the independence of the United States, the twentieth.</p>

<h2>NOTES</h2>
<p>[*]  The proceedings on the libel for damages in the District Court, were accordingly superseded; but an information, Ketland, qui tam, &amp;c. was immediately afterwards filed in the Circuit Court, against the Corvette for the illegal out-fit in violation of the act of Congress, and the vessel being thereupon attached, an application was made to Judge Peters, to discharge her on giving security, but the Judge was of opinion, that he had no power as District Judge, to make such an order in a cause depending in the Circuit Court. The French Minister, then deeming (as I have been informed) this prosecution to be a violation of the rights and property of the Republic, delivered a remonstrance to our government; and, converting the judicial enquiry into a matter of state, abandoned the Corvette, and discharged the officers and crew.

<center><h1>TALBOT, Appellant,<br/>
versus<br/>
JANSON, Appellee, et al.</h1></center>
<center><p><b>Supreme Court of United States.</b></p></center>
<center></center>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*137</span> The cause was argued by Ingersoll, Dallas and Du Ponceau, for the Appellant; and by E. Tilghman, Lewis and Reed (of South Carolina) for the Appellee.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*152</span> On the 22d of August, 1795, the Judges delivered their opinions seriatim.</p>
<p>PATERSON, Justice.</p>
<p>The libel in this cause was exhibited by Joost Jansen, master of the Vrouw Christiana Magdalena, a Dutch brigantine, owned by citizens of the United Netherlands; and its prayer is, that Edward Ballard, and all others, having claim, may be compelled to make restitution. The District Court directed restitution; the Circuit Court affirmed the decree; and the cause is now before this court for revision. The Magdalena was captured by Ballard, or by Ballard and Talbot, and brought into Charleston. The general question is, whether the decree of restitution was well awarded. In discussing the question, it will be necessary to consider the capture as made,</p>
<p>1. By Ballard.</p>
<p>2. By Ballard and Talbot.</p>
<p>1. By Ballard. This ground not being tenable, has been almost abandoned in argument. It is, indeed, impossible to suggest any reason in favor of the capture on the part of Ballard. Who is he? A citizen of the United States: For, although he had renounced his allegiance to Virginia, or declared an intention of expatriation, and admitting the same to have been constitutionally done, and legally proved, yet he had not emigrated to, and become the subject or citizen of, any foreign kingdom or republic. He was domiciliated within the United States, from whence he had not removed and joined himself to any other country, settling there his fortune, and family. <span class="star-pagination">*153</span> From Virginia, he passed into South Carolina, where he failed on board the armed vessel called the Ami de la Liberte. He failed from, and returned to, the United States, without so much as touching at any foreign port, during his absence. In short, it was a temporary absence, and not an entire departure from the United States; an absence with intention to return, as has been verified by his conduct and the event, and not a departure with intention to leave this country, and settle in another. Ballard was, and still is, a citizen of the United States; unless, perchance, he should be a citizen of the world. The latter is a creature of the imagination, and far too refined for any republic of ancient or modern times. If however, he be a citizen of the world, the character bespeaks universal benevolence, and breathes peace on earth and good will to man; it forbids roving on the ocean in quest of plunder, and implies amenability to every tribunal. But what is conclusive on this head is, that Ballard failed from this country with an iniquitous purpose, cum dolo et culpa, in the capacity of a cruizer, against friendly powers. The thing itself was a crime. Now it is an obvious principle, that an act of illegality can never be construed into an act of emigration, or expatriation. At that rate, treason and emigration, or treason and expatriation, would, in certain cases, be synonimous terms. The cause of removal must be lawful; otherwise the emigrant acts contrary to his duty, and is justly charged with a crime. Can that emigration be legal and justifiable, which commits or endangers the neutrality, peace, or safety of the nation of which the emigrant is a member? As we have no statute of the United States, on the subject of emigration, I have taken up the doctrine respecting it, as it stands on the broad basis of the law of nations, and have argued accordingly. That law is in no wise applicable to the present case: for, Ballard, at the time of his taking the command of the Ami de la Liberte, and of his capturing the Magdalena, was a citizen of the United States; he was domiciliated within the same, and not elsewhere; and, besides, his cause of departure, supposing it to have been a total departure from and abandonment of his country, was unwarantable, as he went from the United States, in the character of an illegal cruizer. The act of the legislature of Virginia, does not apply. Ballard was a citizen of Virginia, and also of the United States. If the legislature of Virginia, pass an act specifying the causes of expatriation, and prescribing the manner in which it is to be effected by the citizens of that state, what can be its operation on the citizens of the United States? If the act of Virginia affects Ballard's citizenship, so far as respects that state, can it touch his citizenship so far as it regards the United States? Allegiance to a particular state, is one thing; <span class="star-pagination">*154</span> allegiance to the United States is another. Will it be said, that the renunciation of allegiance to the former implies or draws after it a renunciation of allegiance to the latter? The sovereignties are different; the allegiance is different; the right too, may be different. Our situation being new, unavoidably creates new and intricate questions. We have sovereignties moving within a sovereignty. Of course there is complexity and difficulty in the system, which requires a penetrating eye fully to explore, and steady and masterly hands to keep in unison and order. A flight collision may disturb the harmony of the parts, and endanger the machinery of the whole. A statute of the United States, relative to expatriation is much wanted; especially as the common law of England, is, by the constitution of some of the states, expressly recognized and adopted. Besides, ascertaining by positive law the manner, in which expatriation may be effected, would obviate doubts, render the subject notorious and easy of apprehension, and furnish the rule of civil conduct on a very interesting point.</p>
<p>But there is another ground, which renders the capture on the part of Ballard, altogether unjustifiable. The Ami de la Liberte was built in Virginia, and is owned by citizens of that state; she was fitted out as an armed sloop of war, in, and, as such, failed from, the United States, under the command of Ballard, and cruised against, and captured vessels belonging to, the subjects of European powers, at peace with the said states. Such was her predicament, when she took the Magdalena. It is idle to talk of Ballard's commission; if he had any, it was not a commission to cruise as a privateer, and if so, it was of no validity, because granted to an American citizen, by a foreign officer, within the jurisdiction of the United States. We are not, however, to presume, that the French Admiral or Consul would have issued a commission of the latter kind, because it would have been a flagrant violation of the sovereignty of the United States; and of course incompatible with his official duty. Therefore, it was not, and, indeed, could not, have been a war commission. It is not necessary, at present, to determine, whether acting under colour of such a commission would be a piratical offence? Every illegal act, or transgression, committed on the high seas, will not amount to piracy. A capture, although not piratical, may be illegal, and of such a nature as to induce the court to award restitution.</p>
<p>It has been urged in argument, that the Ami de la Liberte is the property of the French republic. The assertion is not warranted by the evidence; and if it was, would not, perhaps, be of any avail, so as to prevent restitution by the competent authority. The proof is clear and satisfactory, that the was an American vessel, owned by citizens of the United States, and <span class="star-pagination">*155</span> still continues to be so. The evidence in support of her being French property is extremely weak and futile; it makes no impression, it merits no attention. But if the Ami de la Liberte be the property of the French Republic, it might admit of a doubt, whether it would be available, so as to legalise her captures and prevent restoration; because she was, after the sale (if any took place) to the republic, and before her departure from, and while she remained in, the United States, fitted out as an armed vessel of war; from whence in such capacity, and commanded by Ballard, an American citizen, she set sail, and made capture of vessels belonging to citizens of the United Netherlands. The United States would, perhaps, be bound, both by the law of nations and an express stipulation in their treaty with the Dutch, to restore such captured vessels, when brought within their jurisdiction, especially if they had not been proceeded upon to condemnation in the Admiralty of France. On this, however, I give no opinion. The United States are neutral in the present war; they take no part in it; they remain common friends to all the belligerent powers, not favoring the arms of one to the detriment of the others. An exact impartiality must mark their conduct towards the parties at war; for, if they favour one to the injury of the other, it would be a departure from pacific principles, and indicative of an hostile disposition. It would be a fraudulent neutrality. To this rule there is no exception, but what arises from the obligation of antecedent treaties, which ought to be religiously observed. If, therefore, the capture of the Magdalena was effected by Ballard alone, it must be pronounced to be illegal, and of course the decree of restitution is just and proper. This leads us,</p>
<p>II. To consider the capture as having been made by Ballard and Talbot. Talbot commanded the privateer L'Ami de la Point a Pitre. The question is, as the Magdalena struck to and was made prize of by Ballard, and as Talbot, who knew his situation, aided in his equipment, and acted in confederacy with him, afterwards had a sort of joint possession, whether Talbot can detain her as prize by virtue of his French commission? To support the validity of Talbot's claim it is contended, that Ballard had no commission or an inadequate one, and therefore his capture was illegal: That it was lawful for Talbot to take possession of the ship so captured, being a Dutch bottom, as the United Netherlands were at open war and enmity with the French republic, and Talbot was a naturalized French citizen, acting under a regular commission from the Governor of Guadaloupe. It has been already observed, that Ballard was a citizen of the United States; that the Ami de la Liberte, of which he had the command, was fitted out and armed as a vessel of war in the United States; that as such she sailed from the United States, and cruised against <span class="star-pagination">*156</span> nations at peace and in amity with the said states. These acts were direct and daring violations of the principles of neutrality, and highly criminal by the law of nations. In effecting this state of things, how far was Talbot instrumental and active? What was his knowledge, his agency, his agency, his participation, his conduct in the business? It appears in evidence, that Talbot expected Ballard at Tybee; that he waited for him there several days; that he set fail without him, and in a short time returned to his former station. This indicates contrivance and a previous communication of designs. At length Ballard appeared. On his arrival, Talbot put on board the Ami de la Liberte, in Savannah river, and confessedly within the jurisdiction of the United States, four cannon, which he had brought for the purpose. Were these guns furnished by order of the French Consul? The insinuation is equally unfounded and dishonorable. They also fired a salute, and hailed Sinclair, a citizen of the United States, as an owner. An incident of this kind, at such a moment, has the effect of illumination. Talbot knew Ballard's situation, and in particular aided in fitting out the Ami de la Liberte by furnishing her with guns. Without this assistance she would not have been in a state for war. An essential part of the outfit, therefore, was provided by Talbot. The equipment being thus completed, the two privateers went to sea. When on the ocean, they acted in concert; they cruize together, they fought together, they captured together. Talbot knew that Ballard had no commission; he so states it in his claim: the facts confirm the statement; for, about an hour after Ballard had captured the Magdalena, he came up, and took a joint possession, hoping to cover the capture by his commission, and thus to legalife Ballard's spoliation. How filly and contemptible is cunning Â— how vile and debasing is fraud. In furnishing Ballard with guos, in aiding him to arm and outfit, in co-operating with him on the high seas, and using him as the instrumeat and means of capturing vessels, Talbot assumed a new character, and instead of pursuing his commission acted in opposition to it. If he was a French citizen, duly naturalized, and if, as such, he had a commission, fairly obtained, he was authorized to capture ships belonging to the enemies of the French Republic, but not warranted in seducing the citizens of neutral nations from their duty, and assisting them in committing depredations upon friendly powers. His commission did not authorize him to abet the predatory schemes of an illegal cruiser on the high seas; and if he undertook to do so, he unquestionably deviated from the path of duty. Talbot was an original trespasser, for he was concerned in the illegal outfit of the Ami de la Liberte. Shall he then reap any benefit from her captures, when brought within <span class="star-pagination">*157</span> the United States? Besides, it is in evidence, that Ballard took possession first of the Magdalena, and put on board of her a prize-master and some hands; Talbot, in about an hour after, came up, and also put on board a prize-master, and other men. The possession in the first instance was Ballard's; he was not ousted of it; they prey was not taken from him; indeed, it was never intended to deprive him of it. So far from it, that it was an artifice to cover the booty. Talbot's possession was gained by a fraudulent cooperation with Ballard, a citizen of the United States, and was a mere setch or contrivance in order to secure the capture. Ballard still continued in possession. The Magdalena thus taken and possessed, was carried into Charleston. Can there be a doubt with respect to restoration? Stating the case answers the question. It has been said that Ballard had a commission, and acted under it. The point has already been considered, and indeed is not worth debating; the commission, if any, was illegal, and of course the seizures were so. But then what effect has this upon Talbot? Does it make his case better or worse? The truth is, that Talbot knew that Ballard had no commission, and he also knew the precise case and situation of the Ami de la Liberte; to whom she belonged, where fitted out, and for what purpose. Talbot gave Ballard guns within the jurisdiction of the United States, and thus aided in making him an illegal cruizer; he conforted and acted with him, and was a participant in the iniquity and fraud. In short, Ballard took the Magdalena, had the possession of her, and kept it; Talbot was in under Ballard by connivance and fraud, not with a view to oust him of the prize, but to cover and secure it; not with a view to bring him into judgment as a transgressor against the law of nations, but to intercept the stroke of justice and prevent his being punished. If Talbot procured possession of the Magdalena through the medium of Ballard, a citizen of the United States, and then brought her within the jurisdiction of the said States, would it not be the duty of the competent authority to order her to be restored? The principle deducible from the law of nations, is plain; Â— you shall not make use of our neutral arm, to capture vessels of your enemies, but of our friends. If you do, and bring the captured vessels within our jurisdiction, restitution will be awarded. Both the powers, in the present instance, though enemies to each other, are friends of the United States; whose citizens ought to preserve a neutral attitude; and should not assist either party in their hostile operations. But if, as is agreed on all hands, Ballard first took possession of the Magdalena, and if he continued in possession, and brought her within the jurisdiction of the United States, which I take to be the case, then no question can arise with respect to the legality <span class="star-pagination">*158</span> of restitution. It is an act of justice, resulting from the law of nations, to restore to the friendly power the possession of his vessel, which a citizen of the United States illegally obtained, and to place Joost Jansen, the master of the Magdalena, in his former state, from whence he had been removed by the improper interference, and hostile demeanor of Ballard. Besides, it is right to conduct all cases of this kind, in such a manner, as that the persons guilty of fraud, should not gain by it. Hence the efficacy of the legal principle, that no man shall set up his own fraud or iniquity, as a ground of action or defence. This maxim applies forcibly to the present case, which, in my apprehension, is a fraud upon the principles of neutrality, a fraud upon the law of nations, and an insult, as well as a fraud, against the United States, and the Republic of France.</p>
<p>I am, therefore, of opinion, that the decree of the Circuit Court ought to be affirmed. Being clear on the preceding points, it supersedes the necessity of deciding upon other great questions in the cause; such as, whether Redick and Talbot were French citizens; whether the bill of sale was colourable and fraudulent; whether Redick, if a French citizen, did not lend his name as a cover; and whether the property did not continue in Sinclair and Wilson, citizens of the United States.</p>
<p>IREDELL, Justice.</p>
<p>In delivering my opinion on the great points arising in this case, I shall divide the consideration of it under the following heads:</p>
<p>1. Whether the District Court had jurisdiction prima facie upon the subject matter of the libel, taking for granted that the allegations in it were true.</p>
<p>2. Admitting that the court had jurisdiction prima facie, whether William Talbot had stated and supported a case sufficient to entitle him to hold the property as prize, exempt from the jurisdiction and controul of the District Court.</p>
<p>1. The first enquiry is,</p>
<p>Whether the district Court had jurisdiction prima facie upon the subject matter of the libel, taking for granted that the allegations in it were true.</p>
<p>These allegations in substance are,</p>
<p>That the ship was taken on the high seas, by a schooner called L'Ami de la Liberte, commanded by Edward Ballard, who had no lawful commission, to take her as the property of an enemy of the French Republic, under whose authority the capture was alleged to be made.</p>
<p>That William Talbot, who came up after the surrender, and put some men on board, when the prize was in possession of Ballard, had also no lawful commission for the purpose of such a capture, being an American citizen, and his owners American citizens likewise.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*159</span> That there was fraud and collusion between Talbot and Ballard, both vessels being in fact the property of the same owners, Wilson and Sincliar, who were American citizens.</p>
<p>Such, substantially, are the allegations of the libel, and admitting them to be true, nothing is more clear than that the capture was unlawful.</p>
<p>But it is objected that this is a question of prize or no prize, and whether the ship was lawfully a prize, or not, is for some court of the French Republic alone to determine, under whose authority Ballard and Talbot alledge they acted; and it is contended, that the capture in question being of a Dutch ship, and not an American, the United States have no right to decide a dispute between the Dutch and the French, in regard to a capture on the high seas, claimed as lawful by one party, and denied to be such by the other, since such an interposition would be equally a violation of the law of nations, and of the 17th article of the treaty with France.</p>
<p>To this objection, the following answers appear to me to be satisfactory:</p>
<p>1. That it is true, both by the law of nations, and the treaty with France, if a French privateer brings an enemy's ship into our ports, which she has taken as prize on the high seas, the United States, as a nation, have no right to detain her, or make any enquiry into the circumstances of the capture.</p>
<p>But this exemption from enquiry, by our courts of justice, in this respect, only belongs to a French privateer, lawfully commissioned, and, therefore, if a vessel claims that exemption, but does not appear to be duly entitled to it, it is the express duty of the court, upon application, to make enquiry, whether she is the vessel she pretends to be, since her title to such exemption depends on that very fact.</p>
<p>Otherwise, any vessel whatever, under a colour of that kind, might capture with impunity, and defy all enquiry, if she kept out of a French port, equally in violation of the law of nations, and insulting to the French Republic, which from a regard to its own honour and a principle of justice, would undoubtedly disdain all piratical assistance. She might say, now I trust, with as much truth as dignity, Non tali auxilio, nec Defensoribus istis tempus eget.</p>
<p>2. That such an enquiry being thus proper to be made, if upon the enquiry it shall appear, that the vesse pretending to be a lawful privateer, is really not such, but us a colourable commission for the purposes of plunder, she to be considered by the law of nations, so far at least as a ansser of property is concerned, or a title to hold it insisted upon, in the same light as having no commission at all.</p>
<p>3. That prima facie all piracies an trespasses committed <span class="star-pagination">*160</span> against the general law of nations, are enquirable, and may be proceeded against, in any nation where no special exemption can be maintained, either by the general law of nations, or by some treaty which forbids or restrains it.</p>
<p>It is expressly held, in an authority quoted 1 Lex Mercatoria 252. "That if a Spaniard robs a Frenchman on the high "seas, their princes being both then in amity with the crown "of England, and the ship is brought into a port in England, "the Frenchman may proceed criminaliter against the Spaniard, "to punish him, and civiliter, to have restitution of his "vessel." The authorities referred to are, Selden mare claus. Lib. 1 chap. 27. Grotius de Jure Belli et Pacis, b. 3. c. 9. s. 16. both books of very high authority.</p>
<p>What is called robbery on the land, is piracy if committed at sea. 3 Inst. 113. 1 Com. Dig. 269. And as every robbery on land includes a trespass, so does every piracy at sea. 1 Com. Dig. 268. Consequently, if there be an unlawful taking, it may be piracy or trespass according to the circumstances of the case, both being equally unlawful, though one a higher species of offence than the other, which cannot alter the intrinsic illegality of the fact common to both, but only occasion a greater or less degree of punishment proportioned to the nature of the offence. It is, therefore, no answer to say, in bar of restitution, that no piracy has been committed, and therefore no restitution is to follow, since, if a trespass has been committed, though not a piracy, restitution is equally proper as if the offence had amounted to piracy itself.</p>
<p>4. That by a due consideration of the law of nations, whatever opinions may have prevailed formerly to the contrary, no hostilties of any kind, except in necessary self-defence, can lawfully be practised by one individual of a nation, against an individual of any other nation at enmity with it, but in virtue of some public authority. War can alone be entered into by national authority; it is instituted for national purposes, and directed to national objects; and each individual on both sides is engaged in it as a member of the society to which he belongs, not from motives of personal malignity and ill will. He is not to fly like a tyger upon his prey, the moment he sees an individual of his enemy before him. Such savage nations, I believe, obtained formerly. Thank God, more rational ones have succeeded, and a liberal man can frequently see great integrity and honor on both sides, though different and irreconcileable views of national interest or principles may unfortunately engage the nations in hostility. Even in the case of one enemy against another enemy, therefore, there is no colour of justification for an offensive hostile act, unless it be authorised <span class="star-pagination">*161</span> by some act of the government giving the public constitutional sanction to it.</p>
<p>5. That notwithstanding an apparent contrariety of opinions on this subject, it would be easy to shew, upon principle, if not by authority, that such hostility committed without public authority on the high seas, is not merely an offence against the nation of the individual committing the injury, but also against the law of nations, and, of course, cognizable in other countries: But that is not material in the present stage of the enquiry, which affects only the conduct of our own citizens in our own vessels, attacking and taking, under colour of a foreign commission, on the high seas, goods of our friends.</p>
<p>This is so palpable a violation of our own law (I mean the common law, of which the law of nations is a part, as it subsisted either before the act of Congress on the subject, or since that has provided a particular manner of enforcing it,) as well as of the law of nations generally; that I cannot entertain the slightest doubt, but that upon the case of the libel, prima facie, the District Court had jurisdiction.</p>
<p>2. The next enquiry is,</p>
<p>Whether William Talbot has stated and supported a case sufficient to entitle him to hold the property as prize, exempt from the jurisdiction of the District Court.</p>
<p>This claim is grounded as follows:</p>
<p>1. That at the time of his receiving the commission, and at the time of the capture, he was a real French citizen, and his vessel was French property, viz. the property of Samuel Redick, a French citizen at Point-a-Pitre in Guadaloupe.</p>
<p>2. That he had a lawful commission to cruize from the French Republic.</p>
<p>3. That whether Ballard had a lawful commission or not, he himself was lawfully entitled: 1. To part, if Ballard had a lawful commission, as having been in fight at the time of the capture, and therefore contributing to intimidate the enemy into a surrender upon the common principle. 2. If Ballard had no lawful commission, and is to be considered as a pirate, his capture did not change the property; of course, it remained Dutch, and he, as captain of a French privateer, had a right to seize and retain it.</p>
<p>The first point to be considered is,</p>
<p>Whether Talbot at the time of his receiving the commission, and at the time of the capture, was a French citizen.</p>
<p>This involves the great question as to the right of expatriation, upon which so much has been said in this cause. Perhaps it is not necessary it should be explicitly decided on this occasion; but I shall freely express my sentiments on the subject.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*162</span> That a man ought not to be a slave; that he should not be confined against his will to a particular spot, because he happened to draw his first breath upon it; that he should not be compelled to continue in a society to which he is accidentally attached, when he can better his situation elsewhere, much less when he must starve in one country, and may live comfortably in another; are positions which I hold as strongly as any man, and they are such as most nations in the world appear clearly to recognize.</p>
<p>The only difference of opinion is, as to the proper manner of executing this right.</p>
<p>Some hold, that it is a natural unalienable right in each individual; that it is a right upon which no act of legislation can lawfully be exercised, inasmuch as a legislature might impose dangerous restraints upon it; and, of course, it must be left to every man's will and pleasure, to go off, when, and in what manner, he pleases.</p>
<p>This opinion is deserving of more deference, because it appears to have the sanction of the Constitution of this state, if not of some other states in the Union.</p>
<p>I must, however, presume to differ from it, for the following reasons:</p>
<p>1. It is not the exercise of a natural right, in which the individual is to be considered as alone concerned. As every man is entitled to claim rights in society, which it is the duty of the society to protect; he, in his turn, is under a solemn obligation to discharge all those duties faithfully, which he owes, as a citizen, to the society of which he is a member, and as a man to the several members of the society individually with whom he is associated. Therefore, if he has been in the exercise of any public trust, for which he has not fully accounted, he ought not to leave the society until he has accounted for it. If he owes money, he ought not to quit the country, and carry all his property with him, without leave of his creditors. Many other cases might be put, shewing the importance of the public having some hold of him, until he has fairly performed all those duties which remain unperformed, before he can honestly abandon the society forever. But it is said, his ceasing to be a citizen, does not deprive the public, or any individual of it, of remedies in these respects: Yet the right of emigration is said to carry with it the right of removing his family, and effects. What hold have they of him afterwards?</p>
<p>2. Some writers on the subject of expatriation say, a man shal not expatriate in a time of war, so as to do a prejudice to his country. But if it be a natural; unalienable, right, upon the footing of mere private will, who can say this shall not be exercised in time of war, as well as in time of peace, since the <span class="star-pagination">*163</span> individual, upon that principle, is to think of himself only? I therefore, think, with one of the gentlemen for the defendant, that the principle goes to a state of war, as well as peace, and it must involve a time of the greatest public calamity, as well as the profoundest tranquillity.</p>
<p>3. The very statement of an exception in time of war, shews that the writers on the law of nations, upon the subject in general, plainly mean, not that it is a right to be always exercised without the least restraint of his own will and pleasure, but that it is a reasonable and moral right which every man ought to be allowed to exercise, with no other limitation than such as the public safety or interest requires, to which all private rights ought and must forever give way. And if in any government, principles of patriotism and public good ought to predominate over mere private inclination, surely they ought to do so in a Republic founded on the very basis of equal rights, to be perfectly enjoyed in every instance, where the public good does not require a restraint.</p>
<p>4. In some instances, even in time of war, expatriation may fairly be permitted. It ought not then to be restrained. But who is to permit it? The Legislature surely; the constant guardian of the public interest, where a new law is to be made, or an old one dispensed with. If they may take cognizance in one instance, (as for example, in time of war) because the public safety may require it, why not in any other instance, where the public safety, for some unknown cause, may equally require it? Upon the eve of a war, it may be still more important to exercise it, as we often fee in case of embargoes.</p>
<p>5. The supposition, that the power may be abused, is of no importance, if the public good requires its exercise. This feverish jealousy, is a passion that can never be satisfied. No man denies the propriety of the Legislature having a taxative power. Suppose it should be seriously objected to, because the Legislature might tax to the amount of 19s. in the pound? They have the power, but does any man fear the exercise of it? A Legislature must possess every power necessary to the making of laws. When constructed as ours is, there is no danger of any material abuse. But a Legislature must be weak to the extremest verge of folly, to with to retain any man as a citizen, whose heart and affections are fixed on a foreign country, in preference to his own. They would naturally with to get rid of him as soon as they could, and, therefore, perhaps, the proper precaution would be, to restrain acts of banishment, (if such could be at all permitted) rather than to limit the legislative controul over expatriation. But is there no danger of abuse on the other fide? Have not all the contentions about expatriation in the courts, arisen from a want of the exercise <span class="star-pagination">*164</span> of this very authority? For, if the Legislature had prescribed a mode, every one would know, whether it had or had not been pursued, and all rights, private as well as public, would be equally guarded; but upon the present doctrine, no rights are secured, but those of the expatriator himself.</p>
<p>I, therefore, have no doubt, that when the question is in regard to a citizen of any country, whose constitution has not prohibited the exercise of the legislative power in this instance, it not only is a proper instance in which it may be exercised, but it is the duty of the Legislature to make such provision, and for my part, I have always thought the Virginia assembly shewed a very judicious foresight in this particular.</p>
<p>Whether the Virginia act of expatriation be now in force, is a question so important, that I would not with unnecessarily to decide it. If it be, I have no doubt that a citizen of that State, cannot expatriate himself in any other manner. It seems most probable (but I think not certain) from this record, that Talbot was a citizen of Virginia. We are, however, undoubtedly to consider him as a citizen of the United States. Admitting he had a right to expatriate himself, without any law prescribing the method of his doing so, we surely must have some evidence that he had done it. There is none, but that he went to the West Indies, and took an oath to the French Republic, and became a citizen there. I do not think that merely taking such an oath, and being admitted a citizen there, in itself, is evidence of a bona fide expatriation, or completely discharges the obligation she owes to his own country. Had there been any restrictions by our own law on his quitting this country, could any act of a foreign country, operate as a repeal of these? Certainly not. When he goes there, they know nothing of him, perhaps, but from his own representation. He becomes a citizen of the new country, at his peril. The act is complete, if he has legally quitted his own: if not, it is subordinate to the allegiance he originally owed. By allegiance, I mean, that tie by which a citizen of the United States is bound as a member of the society. Did any man suppose, when the rights of citizenship were so freely and honorably bestowed on the unfortunate Marquis de la Fayetie, that that absolved him, as a subject or citizen of his own country? It had only this effect, that whenever he came into this country, and chose to reside here, he was ifso facto to be deemed a citizen, without any thing farther. The same consequence, I think, would follow in respect to rights of citizenship, conferred by the French Republic, upon some illustrious characters, in our own, and other countries. If merely intended, as ingeniously suggested at the bar, that upon going to France, and performing the usual requisites, they should be then French citizens, where is the <span class="star-pagination">*165</span> honour of it? Â— Since any man may avail himself of an indiscriminate indulgence granted by law. Some disagreeable dilemmas, may be occasioned by this double citizenship, but the principles, as I have stated them, appear to me to be warranted by law and reason, and if any difficulties arise, they shew more strongly the importance of a law, regulating the exercise of the right in question.</p>
<p>His going to the West Indies, and taking an oath of allegiance there, considering it in itself, is an equivocal act. It might be done, with a view to relinquish his own country forever. It might be done, with a view to relinquish it for a time, in order to gain some temporary benefit by it. If the former, and this was clearly proved, it possibly might have the effect contended for. If the latter, it would shew, that he voluntarily submitted to the embarrassments of two distinct allegiances. He must make them as consistent as he can. By our treaty with Holland, any American citizen, cruising upon Dutch subjects, as commander of a privateer, under a foreign commission, is to be deemed a pirate. If he left America, for the very purpose of doing this, and became a French citizen, that he might have a colour for doing so, then his taking a French commission could not absolve him from a crime which he was committing in the very act of taking it, and of which the French government might not be aware, as they are not bound to take notice of any other treaties but their own. If he went, intending to reside there for a time, and to act under a commission, which he believed would, for the present, justify him, tho' this might excuse him from the guilt of piracy, it would not make such a contract lawful, because, in this case, even his intention was not to expatriate himself forever; and, consequently, he still remained an American citizen, and had no authority to take a commission at all. It surely is impossible for us to say, he meant a real expatriation, when his conduct prima facie, as much indicates a crime, as any thing else. If he had such an intention before he left this country, why not mention it? If a citizen of Virginia, and their act of expatriation was not in force, yet, surely, it prescribed as good a method of effecting it as any other, and his not pursuing this method, (if he really meant an expatriation) can be accounted for in no other manner, but that he was conscious, the vessel he was sitting out, was for the purpose of cruising, and would have been stopt by the government, had his design of expatriation so plainly evinced it.</p>
<p>I therefore, must say, there is no evidence to satisfy me, that he ceased to be an American citizen, so as to be absolved from the duties he owed to his own country; and, among others, that duty of not cruising against the Dutch, in violation of the law of nations, generally, and of the treaty with Holland, in particular.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*166</span> My observations, as to Talbot, will, in a great measure, apply to Redick, who appears to have been a citizen of Virginia. There is no evidence to satisfy me, that he ceased to be an American citizen, and became a French citizen, absolved from the duty he owed, as a citizen, to his own country. There is nothing to shew this, but a residence of no long duration, in a French Island, his taking an oath to the French Republic, and being admitted a French citizen, which, for the reasons I have given, I do not think sufficient.</p>
<p>In addition to my other observations, I may add, how is it possible, upon this principle, for the public to know in what situation they stand, as to any one of these persons? It is not impossible, (I believe instances indeed have already happened of it) that an American citizen may go to some of the dominions of the French, become a French citizen for a time, enjoy all the benefits of such, and afterwards return to his own country, and claim, and enjoy, all the privileges of a citizen there, without the least possibility of the public knowing, otherwise than from accident, whether he has become a citizen of another government, or not. Suppose one of them was to insist on holding an estate in land, devised to him after his new citizenship, how could it be proved he was an alien?</p>
<p>Whether, therefore, the property of the privateer, was in Redick, or in Wilson and Sinclair, I think it was equally American property, tho' I confess, the weight of the evidence, impresses me strongly with a belief, that the property was Wilson and Sinclair's. And, in regard to the objection, that nothing they could say or do, or Talbot either, could affect Redick, I think, as Talbot appears as the agent of Redick, of whom we know nothing but through him, his declarations are to be regarded as Redick's own, and any declarations of Wilson or Sinclair, in his presence, and any of the conduct of either of them, sanctioned by him, must have the same effect, as if the declarations had been made in the presence of Redick, and such conduct sanctioned by himself.</p>
<p>I consider the proof of the commission sufficient, but deny its operations, as I consider the vessel to have been an American vessel, owned by an American or Americans, and with an American Captain on board.</p>
<p>I now proceed to enquire into the consequences of Ballard's capture, and Talbot's co-operation with him, tho' perhaps, upon my principles, it is not absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>1. Ballard's capture, I think, is clearly insupportable. Admitting him to have been expatriated, (which, if the Virginia law was in force, I think he was) he did not become a French citizen at all. Only one of the crew was a Frenchman. I think, all the rest were proved to be Americans, or English. She <span class="star-pagination">*167</span> was fitted out in the United States. The commission, if good at all, was of a temporary and secret nature, and seems to have been confined to a special purpose, to be executed within the United States. She certainly had no authority to cruize, that being specified in every commission of that nature. Whoever were her owners, she does not appear to have been French property. On the contrary, there is the highest possibility, that Talbot's and Ballard's vessels had the same owners. So conscious was he of the illegality of his conduct, that he even preferred no claim for the captured property.</p>
<p>2. Talbot (considering himself as master of a lawful privateer) claims upon two grounds: 1. Upon supposition of Ballard's being a lawful commission, he claims, as being in sight at the time of the capture. To this, it issufficient to say, that it was not a lawful commission. 2. If Ballard had no lawful commission, he claims upon his independent right, alledging, that if Ballard had no lawful commission, the property was not changed to Ballard, and therefore he had a right to take.</p>
<p>This claim (if Talbot's was a lawful privateer) would undoubtedly be good, if he was not a consederate with Ballard. But it is clear that he was, that he cruized before and after, in company with him, that he put guns on board of his vessel; and there is the strongest reason to believe, that they both belonged to the same owners. It is true, if Talbot had come up, ignorant of Ballard's authority, and inadvertently put men on board the prize in conjunction with Ballard, supposing he had a lawful commission, when in reality he had not, it might with some reason be contended, that Talbot should hold the prize. But, wilful ignorance, is never excuseable; when there is time to enquire, enquiry ought to be made. There is not, however, the least reason for supposing any ignorance in the case. He abetted Ballard's authority, such as it was. He acted in support of it, not in opposition to it. It does not appear that he ever questioned it, until after his arrival in Charleston. It was, therefore, a mere after-thought. A man having a commission, is authorized, but not compelled, to exercise it. His will must concur to make a capture under it. It does not appear, that he relied, at sea, upon his own force, but upon Ballard's; at least, in this instance, upon his own and Ballard's in conjunction. A man having a lawful commission, is authorised to cruize himself, and to cruize in company with others, having lawful authority. It does not authorise him to associate with pirates, or any unlawful depredators, on the high seas. If he does so, he departs from his commission, assumes a new character, which that does not authorise, and risques all the consequences of it. It is impossible that Ballard can be guilty of <span class="star-pagination">*168</span> a crime, and Talbot, who associated with him, in the wilful commission of it, can be wholly innocent of it. A man can be guilty of no crime, in obeying a lawful commission. He, therefore, in this instance, if guilty of a crime, must be considered altogether detached from a rightful authority, which he abandoned, in search of the profit of an illegal adventure. If, at sea, he acted in support of Ballard's claim, how can he claim now, on the principle of that being insupportable? At sea, was the place for him to make his option. He has no right, after the prize is brought into port, to say Â— "I made a "bad option there: I supported Ballard's claim, whereas I "ought to have opposed it, and stood upon my own. I will "now take this Dutch Ship as a prize, by my own authority." For such, in effect, I take to be the substance of any claim, suggested after his arrival in port.</p>
<p>I therefore think, upon this ground, even admitting, that Talbot's was a rightful privateer, his claim is insupportable.</p>
<p>WILSON, Justice.</p>
<p>As I decided this cause in the Circuit Court, it gives me pleasure to be relieved from the necessity of giving any opinion on the appeal, by the unanimity of sentiment that prevails among the judges.</p>
<p>CUSHING, Justice.</p>
<p>The facts in this case, so far as they appear to me to be essential for forming an opinion, may be reduced to a very narrow compass. Ballard, the commander of a vessel, which was illegally fitted out in the United States, cruizes in company with Talbot, who alledges that he is a French citizen, and produces a French commission. Ballard captures the Magdalena, a Dutch prize; then Talbot joins him; and both, having put prize-masters on board, bring the prize into the harbour of Charleston. The questions arising on this statement are, simply, whether the capture, under such circumstances, is a violation of our treaty with Holland? And whether it is such a case of prize, at the courts of the United States can take cognizance of, consistently with the treaty between America and France? Now, the whole transaction at Gaudaloupe, as well as here, presents itself to my mind as fraudulent and collusive. But even supposing that Talbot was, bona fide, a French citizen, the other circumstances of the case are sufficient to render the capture void. It was, in truth, a capture by Ballard, who had no authority, or colour of authority, for his conduct. He was an American citizen; he had never left the United States; his vessel was owned by American citizens; and the commission, which he held by assignment, was granted by a French admiral, within the United States, to another person, for a particular purpose, but not for the purpose of capture. Then, shall not the property, which he has thus taken from a nation at peace with the United States, and <span class="star-pagination">*169</span> brought within our jurisdiction, be restored to its owners? Every principle of justice, law and policy, unite in decreeing the affirmative; and there is no positive compact with any power to prevent it.</p>
<p>On the important right of expatriation, I do not think it necessary to give an opinion; but the doctrine mentioned by Hcineccius, seems to furnish a reasonable and satisfactory rule. The act of expatriation should be bona fide, and manifested, at least, by the emigrant's actual removal, with his family and effects, into another country. This, however, forms no part of the ground, on which I think the decree of the Circuit Court ought to be affirmed.</p>
<p>RUTLEDGE, Chief Justice.</p>
<p>The merits of the cause are so obvious, that I do not conceive there is much difficulty in pronouncing a fair and prompt decision, for affirming the decree of the Circuit Court.</p>
<p>The doctrine of expatriation is certainly of great magnitude; but it is not necessary to give an opinion upon it, in the present cause, there being no proof, that Captain Talbot's admission as a citizen of the French Republic, was with a view to relinquish his native country; and a man may, at the same time, enjoy the rights of citizenship under two governments.</p>
<p>It appears, upon the whole, that Ballard's vessel was illegally fitted out in the United States; and the weight of evidence satisfies my mind, that Talbot's vessel, which was originally American property, continued so at the time of the capture, notwithstanding all the fraudulent attempts to give it a different complexion. The capture, therefore, was a violation of the law of nations, and of the treaty with Holland. The court has a clear jurisdiction of the cause, upon the express authority of Pelaches's Case. 4. Inst. And every motive of good faith and justice must induce us to concur with the Circuit Court, in awarding restitution.</p>
<p>The Decree of the Circuit Court affirmed.</p>
<p>The Counsel for the Appellees, then moved the court to assess additional damages, which was opposed by Dallas, for the Appellant; and, after argument, the following order was made:</p>
<p>BY THE COURT: Ordered, that the decree of the Circuit Court of South Carolina district, pronounced on the 5th day of November, in the year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and ninety-four, affirming the decree of the District Court of the same district, pronounced on the sixth day of August, in the year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and ninety-ty-four, be in all its parts established and affirmed. And it is further considered, ordered, adjudged and decreed, that the said William Talbot, the Plaintiff in error, do pay to the said Joost <span class="star-pagination">*170</span> Jansen, the Defendant in error, in addition to the sum of one thousand seven hundred and fifty-five dollars fifty-three cents, for demurrage and interest, and eighty-two dollars for costs, in the decree of the said Circut Court mentioned, demurrage for the detention and delay, of the said brigantine Vrouw Christina Magdalena, at the rate of nine dollars and thirty-three cents, lawful money of the United States, per diem, to be accounted from the fifth day of November last past, till the sixth day of June last, the day of the actual sale of the said brigantine, under the interlocutory order of this court, of the third day of March last past, to wit, for two hundred and thirteen days, a sum of nineteen hundred and eighty-seven dollars and twenty-nine cents; and also interest at the rate of seven per centum per annum, for two hundred and ninety days, on the sum of fifty-one thousand eight hundred and forty five dollars, being the amount of the sales of the cargo of the said brigantine heretofore sold, by order and permission of the said District Court, and making a sum of two thousand eight hundred and eighty-three dollars and forty-two cents; and also a like sum of seven per centum per annum on the amount of sales of the said brigantine Vrouw Christina Magdalena, under the order of this court, that is to say, interest for seventy-seven days, on the sum of eighteen hundred and twenty dollars, from the said sixth day of June last, making the sum of twenty-six dollars and eighty-seven cents, the whole of which interest to be accounted to this day, and making together the sum of two thousand nine hundred and ten dollars twenty-nine cents, lawful money of the United States; and which said interest and demurrage, make together the sum of four thousand eight hundred and ninety-seven dollars fifty-eight cents, in addition to and exclusive of the demurrage interest and costs adjudged in the said Circuit Court of the United States, for South Carolina district; also nine-one dollars and ninety-three cents, for his costs and charges: and that the said Joost Jansen have execution of this judgment and decree by special mandate to the said Circuit Court, and process agreeable to the act of the Congress of the United States, in that case made and provided.</p>

<p class="parties">Hills et al Plaintiffs in Error<br/>v.<br/>Ross</p>
<p class="date">February Term, 1796</p>
<div class="num" id="p1">
<span class="num">1</span>
<p class="indent">This was a writ of error directed to the Circuit Court for the District of Georgia. On the return of the record, several errors were assigned; but the only one, now relied on, states 'that the facts on which the Circuit Court had founded their decree, did not appear fully upon the record, either from the pleadings and decree itself, or a state of the case agreed to by the parties, or their council, or by a stating of the case by the court,' as required by the 19th section of the judiciary act.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p2">
<span class="num">2</span>
<p class="indent">On examining this record, it was found, that no statement of facts had been made either by the court or the parties, nor did it appear from the pleadings and decree, upon what facts the decree of the Circuit Court had been founded. But it appeared, that a number of witnesses, had been produced and sworn, (the record did not say examined) at the hearing before the Circuit Court, whose testimony had not been committed to writing; while, on the other hand, the depositions of the witnesses who had been examined before the District Court, were annexed to the proceedings returned. It was acknowledged by the council for the Defendants in error, that the testimony of the witnesses produced in the Circuit Court, had been taken viva vece, according to the 30th section of the judiciary act, and that their depositions had not been committed to writing. It was conceded by the council on both sides, that without other aids than such as were to be derived from this imperfect record, it would be impossible to obtain a fair review of the proceedings of the Circuit Court in this cause. But Cox and Duponceau, for the Plaintiffs in error, contended for a reversal of the decree. Reed (of South Carolina) E. Tilghman and Lewis for the Defendants, insisted on the other hand, that the decree ought to be affirmed, unless it was shown to be erroneous; that the omission on which the Plaintiffs relied, could not be assigned as an error, and did not vitiate the proceedings; that it was to be ascribed to the neglect of the Plaintiffs themselves, who ought, in the first instance, to have applied to the adverse council to state a case, and if they refused, or disagreed in their statement, then to the court itself; that the Defendants being satisfied with the decree and not intending to appeal therefrom, it was not their business to assist the Plaintiffs in perfecting their record, so as to enable them to bring it properly before an Appellate Court. Upon the whole, they prayed that the decree be affirmed.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p3">
<span class="num">3</span>
<p class="indent">For the Plaintiffs in error, it was insisted, that the omission of a statement of the case, vitiated the whole record. The judiciary act of the United States had greatly innovated upon the old system of Admiralty and Chancery proceedings, the forms and principles of the common law were interwoven with, and in many cases, entirely substituted to those of the Roman jurisprudence. The 30th section of that act required, that the testimony of witnesses should be taken viva voce, instead of written depositions, both in the District and the Circuit Court. In the former of these tribunals, indeed, when either of the parties expressed an intention of appealing to the other, the depositions of the witnesses were to be committed to writing, but this case was an exception to the general rule. In the Circuit Court, where new evidence was admitted, no provision had been made for committing the testimony to writing, except in the case of absent, aged, infirm or departing witnesses, whose evidence might be taken de bene effe, precisely as in the common law courts. The whole testimony, therefore, could not, without the consent of parties, come before the Supreme Court of the United States, in any case where new witnesses were heard, or the same witnesses who were examined below, were produced do novo before the Circuit Court.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p4">
<span class="num">4</span>
<p class="indent">It was clear, that the intention of Congress was to vest the power of trying matters of fact in Admiralty and Equity cases, in the District and Circuit Courts exclusively. Like the verdict of a jury, the decision of the latter tribunal, was final and conclusive, as to fact. The Supreme Court were only empowered to correct their decrees in matters of law. Therefore an appeal did not lie to them, but only a writ of error, as at common law. And by the twenty second section of the judiciary act, it was provided, that no decree of the Circuit Courts should be reversed for any error in fact.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p5">
<span class="num">5</span>
<p class="indent">But still the civil law pleadings, as by bill or libel, answer, &amp;c. were retained in the courts below. Those not being carried on with the logical closeness and accuracy, for which the system of common law pleadings is so much and so justly admired, the facts which grounded the decree, would seldom, if ever, appear from the pleadings and decree itself. Amidst the heap of matter with which libels and answers are generally crowded, and the variety of facts, often immaterial to the real points in contest, asserted and denied by the respective parties, it would be often difficult even to know what was the true object of the controversy. The law, therefore, wisely ordered that the facts on which the decree was founded, where they did not appear from the pleadings and decree itself, should be shown by a statement, which, like a special verdict, should enable the court to determine whether the inferences of law, drawn from those facts by the inferior court, were just or erroneous.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p6">
<span class="num">6</span>
<p class="indent">To cause such a statement to be made, or to make it themselves, was a duty which the law enjoined upon the Circuit Courts, and which they were bound to perform. The words of the act of Congress were express and imperative. 'It shall be the duty of the Circuit Courts, in causes in Equity and of Admiralty and Maritime jurisdiction, to cause the facts on which they found their sentence, or decree, fully to appear upon the record, either from the pleadings and decree itself, or a state of the case agreed by the parties, or their council, or if they disagree, by a stating of the case by the court.' The court were therefore bound to see that the facts appeared upon the record, in some one or other of these modes, neigher party could compel the adverse counsel or the court to state a case; and the courts, by omitting this indispensible requisite, had it in their power, whenever they pleased, to make their decrees final and conclusive, in law as well as in fact, and effectually to deprive the unsuccessful party of the benefit of a revision, which the law had expressly provided in his favour. It being then the default of the court, it might be well assigned for error. 8 Co. 59. Cro. Eliz. 84. 107. And the act of Congress, being introductory of a new law, was to be strictly pursued. 4 Bac. Ab. 641. 2 Stra. 971.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p7">
<span class="num">7</span>
<p class="indent">The Council further illustrated the subject by several analogies drawn from the civil and the common law. It was, they said, a principle which appeared to pervade those two systems, that where the superior court were judges of law and fact, the inferior tribunal was bound to return to them the whole evidence; when judges of law only, then they were bound to make the facts appear upon which the judgment or decree was founded. Orders of the courts of Quarter Sessions are only to be quashed for errors in law, therefore, it is only necessary that the facts on which they were founded, should appear upon the record; but in the case of convictions by justices upon penal statutes, the facts are to be re-examined, and, therefore, they are bound to set forth the whole evidence. 2 Stra. 997. At common law, where the trial is by jury, still the facts on which the judgment is founded, must appear on the face of the whole record, and where the verdict did not find precisely the matter in issue, as where it found that 'by non performance of the promise,' the Plaintiff had sustained 50 damages, without expressly finding that the Defendant had promised, the judgment for the Plaintiff was reversed. 21. Via. Ab. 441. because the superior judges could not determine whether the law had been properly inferred from the facts, unless the facts themselves were clearly and expressly stated. This rule obtained at civil law for the very same reasons. On a bill of review in chancery, where the law alone was to be re-examined, it had been often resolved, that the facts proved and allowed by the court as proved, should be so mentioned in the sentence, otherwise on a bill of review, those facts should be taken as not proved, for else a decree could never be reversed by a bill of review, but all erroneous decrees must be reversed on appeals only. 1 Vern. 166. 214. 216. 1 Cha. Ca. 54. 55.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p8">
<span class="num">8</span>
<p class="indent">The Council for the Defendant in error, insisted, that although the want of a statement of facts was a technical defect in the record before the court, which they were willing to supply as much as lay in their power, from their notes of the evidence which had been taken before the Circuit Court; yet the court could not, without great injustice, reverse the decree on that account. They were bound by the twenty fourth section of the Judiciary Law, on the reversal of a decree of the court, to pass such a decree as the Circuit Court should have passed. How could they do it in this instance? Were they, for an omission of the court, which they could not help any more than the Defendants, to put it out of their power to obtain justice; and how could they say, that the Circuit Court should have rendered a different decree, since they were not possessed of the merits of the cause?</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p9">
<span class="num">9</span>
<p class="indent">THE COURT were, unanimously, of opinion, that the error assigned, was not a sufficient ground for reversing the decree, and recommended to the parties to come to some agreement, which might bring the matters in controversy fairly before them.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p10">
<span class="num">10</span>
<p class="indent">After some conversation, an agreement took place between the council on both sides, that the cause should be continued to the next term; and that, in the mean time, new evidence might be taken on both sides, and the whole matter of fact, as well as the law, brought before the Supreme Court of the United States, as upon an appeal.<a class="footnote" href="#fn-s" id="fn-s_ref">*</a></p>

<center><h1>M`DONOUGH,<br/>
versus<br/>
DANNERY, and the Ship MARY FORD.</h1></center>
<center><p><b>Supreme Court of United States.</b></p></center>
<center></center>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*190</span> The cause was argued on the 4th and 5th of February, 1796, by E. Tilgham, for the plaintiff in error, and by Ingerjoll &amp; Duponceau in error.</p>
<p>For the Plaintiff in error.</p>
<p>After argument, LOWEL, Judge of the District, delivered the opinion of the court, first recapitulating the facts above stated.</p>
<p>"BY THE COURT. The Libellants have prayed, that the whole of the ship and cargo should be decreed to their use. There have been times in the history of nations, in which vessel and goods, left by necessity on the high seas, have been decreed the property of the finders; and where wrecks on the shore have been with-held from the original proprietors, by the sovereigns of the country, or some great man, on whose lands they have happened to be cast: But in very early times, they have, in both cases, been considered as the property of the original owner. Several of the Roman Emperors made their edicts and decrees, for the preservation of such property, and the restoration of it; and for a long time, the law of nations has been settled on principles consonant to justice and humanity, in favour of the unfortunate proprietors; and the persons who have found and saved the property, have been compensated by such part thereof, or such pecuniary satisfaction, as the laws of particular States have specially provided, or, in want of such provision, (as the writers on the law of nations agree) by such reward as in the opinion of those who, by the municipal laws of the country, are to judge, is equitable and right. In our country, no special rule being established, this court is to determine what, in such case, is equitable and right. The rule in estimation, which ought, in my opinion, to be adopted, would be to give, is possible, to ascertain it, such compensation or reward as would be sufficient inducement to engage reasonable persons, to encounter the peril and expence of the undertaking; what this may be, must, in almost every case, depend on the estimation which the Judge, who is to decide, may make of the expense, the labour, the peril, and the <span class="star-pagination">*191</span> actual suffering of those, by whose exertions the property is saved. And, as several of the most important of these are really mental, to which no measure of weight or capacity can be actually applied, it is probable, different persons would vary considerably in their estimation of them. It may, therefore, be a thing to be wished, that every nation would make, at least, some general rules for determining such cases: but as there are none established in this country, I am bound to exercise my own judgment, in determining what is a just and equitable compensation.</p>
<p>"Admiralty courts having the thing saved under their controul, may either adjudge a portion of such thing to the persons who have saved it, or a sum of money to be paid by the proprietor, or from the produce of the thing sold. And in either case, the same principle ought to operate, and such parts of the thing saved, or sum of money, be decreed to those who save it, as may fully compensate them, and will encourage others to like efforts. In this case, the Mary Ford, when found, was at the mercy of the seas, her fails and rigging partly taken away or lost; very little or no provisions on board her; the George was bound on a foreign voyage, with a valuable cargo, and it does not appear that she had any supernumerary hands; those who undertook to carry her into port, found her greatly disabled and difficult to manage; the risque of their lives must have been considerable, and their exertions great. I think few cases will happen, when the compensation ought to be higher.</p>
<p>"Under all circumstances, therefore, I am of opinion, that one third part of the gross proceeds of the value, ought to be paid to the owners and crew of the ship George, for salvage of the said ship Mary Ford and her cargo, and in full compensation of their services, peril and expenses, in the following proportions which have been since settled by three merchants, named by them, and appointed by the court, viz. Â— to the owners of the George, nine thousand five hundred and eighty dollars, and twenty-eight cents, being two third parts of the sum decreed for the owners of the George and her crew, after deducting three hundred and seventy dollars and forty-two cents, for the owners, for expenses incurred and paid by them, on the joint account of the owners and the crew Â— and the remaining one third, viz. four thousand seven hundred and ninety dollars and fourteen cents, to the captain and crew of the George, in the following proportions, viz. to the Captain, eleven hundred and fifty-six dollars and twenty cents Â— Lemuel Foster, eight hundred and twenty-five dollars and ninety cents Â— John Classin, four hundred and ninety-five dollars and fifty-four cents Â— five seamen, three hundred and thirty dollars and thirty-six cents each Â— one other, two hundred and eighty-nine dollars and seven cents Â— the cook, two hundred and forty-seven dollars and seventy-seven <span class="star-pagination">*192</span> cents Â— and the boy, one hundred and twenty-three dollars and eighty-six cents.</p>
<p>"The next question is, to whom shall the residue be decreed? To settle this question, passages have been read from many books written on the law of nations, and others in which the municipal regulations, and decisions of several nations have been reported or commented on; and which have been supposed to be applicable to this case. The gentlemen who have been of counsel for the parties, have ingeniously supported their respective claims; I have, I trust, carefully perused their authorities and attended to their arguments; Â— very few of their authorities appear to me to apply; their arguments have been pertinent. I lay out of the case, the whole doctrine of postliminy, as applied to re-captures, which I consider as depending on the municipal regulations of States, which every sovereign has a right to make, as far, at least, as their own citizens only, are concerned, in such manner as may appear to them best. Under this head, though blended by some writers with the law of nations, are to be placed the regulations made, variously however, by the European nations, and the late Congress of the United States, by which the property is divested from the former owners, by capture, after twenty four hours possession by the enemy; and all other arbitrary rules, made to settle questions of like nature; also, all questions about total and partial losses on policies of insurance.</p>
<p>"I embrace as found doctrine, the principle, that neutral nations ought not to decide respecting the lawfulness or unlawfulness of capture, if it appears that the captor, and the nation from whom the property is taken, are at war with each other, and the captors or their vendees, are in possession of the property, save where the territorial rights of the neutral, or the rights of their citizens, are involved in the question; and that neutrals are always to take the existing state of things as right; so that if either of the powers at war, or those to whom they have transferred it, are in possession of a thing taken from their enemy in war, neutral powers are to suppose them lawfully possessed, and ought not to enquire how long, or under what circumstances, they have possessed them. To interfere and decide in such cases, must necessarily imply a partiality contrary to the idea of neutrality; for, they must either give greater firmness to the capture by deciding it to be lawful, or weaken and render it less secure, by determining it to be unlawful. Neither are neutral powers to give aid to either party, by conducting their prizes for them, when they are too weak to protect and conduct them.</p>
<p>"These principles, I think, will serve as a guide to a decision in this case. Â— Neither of the belligerent powers was in possession <span class="star-pagination">*193</span> of this property when found; Â— the British claimants say, it has been their's; Â— this is admitted by the French claimants; Â— and we have evidence of this fact by the construction of the ship which is in our fight, by the cargo on board and divers ships papers which were found with her. The French claimants say, we took her in open war, Â— we firmly possessed her, Â— and she ought to be restored to us. The reply in behalf of the British claimants is, you did not complete your capture; you did not firmly possess her; Â— you were too weak, consistent with other views you held more important, to retain her. Is it necessary that we should decide these questions between them? Shall we try the legality of the capture, and decide the firmness of the possession? Will it not be to aid, to make the capture and possession firm and legal, which is said to be incomplete? The French claimants say, we were under apprehension of weakening our force and so left her from necessity. The vessel had been British, Â— of this, there is no question: did she by capture and firm possession, according to the law of nations, become French? Of this there is at least a doubt. On considering the whole matter, I do adjudge, order, and decree, that one third part of the money, arising from the sales of the ship Mary Ford and her cargo, be paid to the persons who saved them, in the proportions before mentioned. And that the duties and all other costs and charges be first deducted from the other two third parts, and the residue remain in Court for the use of the British owners of said ship and cargo, or such other persons, who may derive right thereto from them, when the same shall be ascertained in Court."</p>
<p>From the decree of the District Judge, so far only as it respects the British owners, the French Consul appealed, and the appeal being argued before the Circuit Court, the following decree was there pronounced, (Judge LOWELL declining however to give any opinion:)</p>
<p>"CUSHING, Justice.</p>
<p>The court having fully heard the parties on the appeal in this case, by their counsel, it appears that the said ship Mary Ford and her cargo, being the property of some British subjects, were, on or about the 28th day of September, A.D. 1794, captured on the high seas, by a French squadron of ships, under the command of Commodore Vil Maudarine, and were taken into actual and quiet possession of said fleet, and so held for above twenty-four hours, and were then left on the high seas, without any hands aboard, after some unsuccessful attempts, by his order, to burn her, which was in consequence of many of the people of his squadron being sick, and incapable of doing duty, and from an apprehension of weakening his force in parting with any of his people, to keep on board and to conduct the said ship Mary Ford.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*194</span> "That the said ship George, met with the said ship Mary Ford, and brought her and her cargo into the harbour of Boston, as set forth in the libel; not with intent to aid either party, in the war subsisting between the French Republic and the British nation, but to save the property from absolute loss, or in expectation of proper compensation for the trouble. On which case the operation of the law of nations appears to the court to be, that by the said capture, the property became immediately the captor's. The questions about firm possession, appearing to relate chiefly, if not only, to cases of possession or recapture, or to that of a neutral vendee; things which 'tis apprehended have no place in this cause; and about which the municipal laws and regulations of different countries are very different.</p>
<p>"The property, then, in this case, becoming the captor's immediately by conquest, and the right of war, must so continue, until divested by recapture, or by some legal means or act to that effect. And it is not conceived, that the abandoning the ship from the occasion stated in the evidence, could amount to a recapture, so far as to invest the property in the original owners, or prevent the captors from reclaiming the possession, when opportunity offered at any time previous to a recapture. It is, therefore, considered and decreed BY THE COURT, That the decree made in the District Court, as far only as it decrees, that the said residue of the said two third parts of the money arising from the sales of the said ship Mary Ford and her cargo, remain in court for the use of the British owners of the same ship and cargo, or such other persons who may derive right thereto from them, when the same should be ascertained in court, be, and hereby is, reversed. And it is now further adjudged and decreed BY THIS COURT, That the same residue of the said two-third parts of said money, remain in court for the use of the French Republic, and those concerned in said capture."</p>
<p>From this decree of the Circuit Court, the British Consul appealed; but the appeal being disallowed, the proceedings were removed into the Supreme Court by writ of error; and the Plaintiff assigned for error the decree in favor of the French claimants, and also the disallownace of his appeal; the defendant pleaded in nullo est erratum, and thereupon issue was joined.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*198</span> BY THE COURT: Â— We are unanimously of opinion, that the District Court had jurisdiction upon the subject of salvage; and that, consequently, they must have a power of determining, to whom the residue of the property ought to be delivered.</p>
<p>In determining the question of property, we think, that immediately on the capture, the captors acquired such a right, as no neutral nation could justly impugn or destroy; and, consequently, we cannot say, that the abandonment of the Mary Ford, under the circumstances of this case, revived and restored the interest of the original British proprietors.</p>
<p>Some doubts have been entertained by the court, whether on the principles of an abandonment by the French possessors, the whole property ought not to have been decreed to the American Libellants, or, at least, a greater portion of it by way of salvage; but as they have not appealed from the decision of the inferior court, we cannot now take notice of their interest in the cause.</p>
<p>Upon the whole, let the decree be affirmed.</p>

<p><span class="star-pagination">*207</span> E. Tilghman, for the Plaintiff in error.</p>
<p>Marshall, (of Virginia) for the Defendant in error.</p>
<p>Wilcocks, for the Plaintiff in error.</p>
<p>Lewis, for the Plaintiff in error.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*220</span> THE COURT, after great consideration, delivered their opinions, seriatim, as follow:</p>
<p>CHACE, Justice.</p>
<p>The Defendants in error, on the ____ day of July, 1774, passed their penal bond to Farrell and Jones, for the payment of Â£. 2,976 11 6, of good British money; but the condition of the bond, or the time of payment, does not appear on the record.</p>
<p>On the 20th of October, 1777, the legislature of the commonwealth of Virginia, passed a law to sequester British property. In the 3d section of the law, it was enacted, "that it should be lawful for any citizen of Virginia, owing money to a subject of Great Britain, to pay the same, or any part thereof, from time to time, as he should think sit, into the loan office, taking thereout a certificate for the same, in the name of the creditor, with an indorsement, under the hand of the commissioner of the said office, expressing the name of the payer; and <span class="star-pagination">*221</span> shall deliver such certificate to the governor and the council whose receipt shall discharge him from so much of the debt. And the governor and the council shall, in like manner, lay before the General Assembly, once in every year, an account of these certificates, specifying the names of the persons by, and for whom they were paid; and shall fee to the safe keeping of the same; subject to the future directions of the legislature: provided, that the governor and the council may make such allowance, as they shall think reasonable, out of the INTEREST of the money so paid into the loan office, to the wives and children, residing in the state, of such creditor.</p>
<p>On the 26th of April, 1780, the Defendants in error, paid into the loan office of Virginia, part of their debt, to wit, 3,111 1-9 dollars, equal to Â£933 14 0 Virginia currency; and obtained a certificate from the commissioners of the loan office, and a receipt from the governor and the council of Virginia, agreeably to the above, in part recited law.</p>
<p>The Defendants in error being sued, on the above bond, in the Circuit Court of Virginia, pleaded the above law, and the payment above stated, in bar of so much of the Plaintiff's debt. The plaintiff, to avoid this bar, replied the fourth article of the Definitive Treaty of Peace, between Great Britain and the United States, of the 3d of September, 1783. To this replication there was a general demurrer and joinder. The Circuit Court allowed the demurrer, and the plaintiff brought the present writ of error.</p>
<p>The case is of very great importance, not only from the property that depends on the decision, but because the effect and operation of the treaty are necessarily involved. I wished to decline sitting in the cause, as I had been council, some years ago, in a suit in Maryland, in favour of American debtors; and I consulted with my brethren, who unanimously advised me not to withdraw from the bench. I have endeavored to divest myself of all former prejudices, and to form an opinion with impartiality. I have diligently attended to the arguments of the learned council, who debated the several questions, that were made in the cause, with great legal abilities, ingenuity and skill. I have given the subject, since the argument, my deliberate investigation, and shall, (as briefly as the case will permit,) deliver the result of it with great diffidence, and the highest respect for those, who entertain a different opinion. I solicit, and I hope I shall meet with, a candid allowance for the many imperfections, which may be discovered in observations hastily drawn up, in the intervals of attendance in court, and the consideration of other very important cases.</p>
<p>The first point raised by the council for the Plaintiff in error was, "that the legislature of Virginia had no right to make <span class="star-pagination">*222</span> the law, of the 20th October, 1777, above in part recited. If this objection is established, the judgment of the Circuit Court must be reversed; because it destroys the Defendants plea in bar, and leaves him without defence to the Plaintiff's action.</p>
<p>This objection was maintained on different grounds by the Plaintiff's council. One of them (Mr. Tilghman) contended, that the legislature of Virginia had no right to confiscate any British property, because Virginia was part of the dismembered empire of Great Britain, and the Plaintiff and Defendants were, all of them, members of the British nation, when the debt was contracted, and therefore, that the laws of independant nations do not apply to the case; and, if applicable, that the legislature of Virginia was not justified by the modern law and practice of European nations, in confiscating private debts. In support of this opinion, he cited Vattel Lib. 3. c. 5. s. 77, who expresses himself thus: "The sovereign has naturally the same right over what his subjects may be indebted to enemies. Therefore, he may confiscate debts of this nature, if the term of payment happen in the time of war. But at present, in regard to the advantage and safety of Commerce, all the sovereigns of Europe have departed from this rigour; and, as this custom has been generally received, he, who should act contrary to it, would injure the public faith; for strangers trusted his subjects, only from a firm persuasion, that the general custom would be observed."</p>
<p>The other council for the Plaintiff in error (Mr. Lewis) denied any power in the Virginia legislature, to confiscate any British property, because all such power belonged exclusively to Congress; and he contended, that if Virginia had a power of confiscation, yet, it did not extend to the confiscation of debts by the modern law and practice of nations.</p>
<p>I would premise that this objection against the right of the Virginia legislature to confiscate British property, (and especially debts) is made on the part of British subjects, and after the treaty of peace, and not by the government of the United States. I would also remark, that the law of Virginia was made after the declaration of independence by Virginia, and also by Congress; and several years before the Consederation of the United States, which, although agreed to by Congress on the 15th of November, 1777, and assented to by ten states, in 1778, was only finally completed and ratified on the 1st of March, 1781.</p>
<p>I am of opinion that the exclusive right of confiscating, during the war, all and every species of British property, within the territorial limits of Virginia, resided only in the Legislature of that commonwealth. I shall hereafter consider whether the law of the 20th of October 1777, operated to confiscate or extinguish <span class="star-pagination">*223</span> British debts, contracted before the war. It is worthy of remembrance, that Delegates and Representatives were elected, by the people of the several counties and corporations of Virginia, to meet in general convention, for the purpose of framing a NEW government, by the authority of the people only; and that the said Convention met on the 6th of May, and continued in session until the 5th of July 1776; and, in virtue of their delegated power, established a constitution, or form of government, to regulate and determine by whom, and in what manner, the authority of the people of Virginia was thereafter to be executed. As the people of that country were the genuine source and fountain of all power, that could be rightfully exercised within its limits; they had therefore an unquestionable right to grant it to whom they pleased, and under what restrictions or limitations they thought proper. The people of Virginia, by their Constitution or fundamental law, granted and delegated all their Supreme civil power to a Legislature, an Executive, and a Judiciary; The first to make; the second to execute; and the last to declare or expound, the laws of the Commonwealth. This abolition of the Old Government, and this establishment of a new one was the highest act of power, that any people can exercise. From the moment the people of Virginia exercised this power, all dependence on, and connection with Great Britain absolutely and forever ceased; and no formal declaration of Independence was necessary, although a decent respect for the opinions of mankind required a declaration of the causes, which impelled the separation; and was proper to give notice of the event to the nations of Europe. Â— I hold it as unquestionable, that the Legislature of Virginia established as I have stated by the authority of the people, was for ever thereafter invested with the supreme and sovereign power of the state, and with authority to make any Laws in their discretion, to affect the lives, liberties, and property of all the citizens of that Commonwealth, with this exception only, that such laws should not be repugnant to the Constitution, or fundamental law, which could be subject only to the controul of the body of the nation, in cases not to be defined, and which will always provide for themselves. The legislative power of every nation can only be restrained by its own constitution: and it is the duty of its courts of justice not to question the validity of any law made in pursuance of the constitution. There is no question but the act of the Virginia Legislature (of the 20th of October 1777) was within the authority granted to them by the people of that country; and this being admitted, it is a necessary result, that the law is obligatory on the courts of Virginia, and, in my opinion, on the courts of the United States. If Virginia as a sovereign State, violated the ancient or modern <span class="star-pagination">*224</span> law of nations, in making the law of the 20th of October 1777, she was answerable in her political capacity to the British nation, whose subjects have been injured in consequence of that law. Suppose a general right to confiscate British property, is admitted to be in Congress, and Congress had confiscated all British property within the United States, including private debts: would it be permitted to contend in any court of the United States, that Congress had no power to confiscate such debts, by the modern law of nations? If the right is conceded to be in Congress, it necessarily follows, that she is the judge of the exercise of the right, as to the extent, mode, and manner. The same reasoning is strictly applicable to Virginia, if considered a sovereign nation; provided she had not delegated such power to Congress, before the making of the law of October 1777, which I will hereafter consider.</p>
<p>In June 1776, the Convention of Virginia formally declared, that Virginia was a free, sovereign, and independent state; and on the 4th of July, 1776, following, the United States, in Congress assembled, declared the Thirteen United Colonies free and independent states; and that as such, they had full power to levy war, conclude peace, &amp;c. I consider this as a declaration, not that the United Colonies jointly, in a collective capacity, were independent states, &amp;c. but that each of them had a right to govern itself by its own authority, and its own laws, without any controul from any other power upon earth.</p>
<p>Before these solemn acts of separation from the Crown of Great Britain, the war between Great Britain and the United Colonies, jointly, and separately, was a civil war; but instantly, on that great and ever memorable event, the war changed its nature, and became a PUBLIC war between independent governments; and immediately thereupon ALL the rights of public war (and all the other rights of an independent nation) attached to the government of Virginia; and all the former political connexion between Great Britain and Virginia, and also between their respective subjects, were totally dissolved; and not only the two nations, but all the subjects of each, were in a state of war; precisely as in the present war between Great Britain and France. Vatt. Lib. 3. c. 18, s. 292. to 295. lib. 3. c. 5. s. 70. 72 and 73.</p>
<p>From the 4th of July, 1776, the American States were defacto, as well as de jure, in the possession and actual exercise of all the rights of independent governments. On the 6th of February, 1778, the King of France entered into a treaty of alliance with the United States; and on the 8th of Oct. 1782, a treaty of Amity and Commerce was concluded between the United States and the States General of the United Provinces. I have ever <span class="star-pagination">*225</span> considered it as the established doctrine of the United States, that their independence originated from, and commenced with, the declaration of Congress, on the 4th of July, 1776; and that no other period can be fixed on for its commencement; and that all laws made by the legislatures of the several states, after the declaration of independence, were the laws of sovereign and independent governments.</p>
<p>That Virginia was part of the dismembered British empire, can, in my judgment, make no difference in the case. No such distinction is taken by Vattell (or any other writer) but Vattell, when considering the rights of war between two parties absolutely independent, and no longer acknowledging a common superior (precisely the case in question) thus expresses himself, Lib. 3. c. 18 s. 295. "In such case, the state is dissolved, and the war between the two parties, in every respect, is the same with that of a public war between two different nations." And Vattell denies, that subjects can acquire property in things taken during a CIVIL war.</p>
<p>That the creditor and debtor were members of the same empire, when the debt was contracted, cannot (in my opinion) distinguish the case, for the same reasons. A most arbitrary claim was made by the parliament of Great Britain, to make laws to bind the people of America, in all cases whatsoever, and the King of Great Britain, with the approbation of parliament, employed, not only the national forces, but hired foreign mercenaries to compel submission to this absurd claim of omnipotent power. The resistance against this claim was just, and independence became necessary; and the people of the United States announced to the people of Great Britain, "that they would hold them, as the rest of mankind, enemies in war, in peace, friends." On the declaration of independence, it was in the option of any subject of Great Britain, to join their brethren in America, or to remain subjects of Great Britain. Those who joined us were entitled to all the benefits of our freedom and independence; but those who elected to continue subjects of Great Britain, exposed themselves to any loss, that might arise therefrom. By their adhering to the enemies of the United States, they voluntarily became parties to the injustice and oppression of the British government; and they also contributed to carry on the war, and to enslave their former fellow citizens. As members of the British government, from their own choice, they became personally answerable for the conduct of that government, of which they remained a part; and their property, wherever found (on land or water) became liable to confiscation. On this ground, Congress on the 24th of July, 1776, confiscated any British property taken on the seas. See 2 Ruth. Inst. lib. 2. c. 9. s. 13. p. 531. 559. Vatt. <span class="star-pagination">*226</span> lib. 2. c. 7. s. 81. &amp; c. 18. s. 344. lib. 3. c. 5. s. 74. &amp; c. 9. s. 161 &amp; 193.</p>
<p>The British creditor, by the conduct of his sovereign, became an enemy to the commonwealth of Virginia; and thereby his debt was forfeitable to that government, as a compensation for the damages of an unjust war.</p>
<p>It appears to me, that every nation at war with another is justifiable, by the general and strict law of actions, to seize and confiscate all moveable property of its enemy, (of any kind or nature whatsoever) wherever found, whether within its territory, or not. Bynkershoek Q.I.P. de rebus bellicis. Lib. 1. c. 7. p. 175. thus delivers his opinion. "Cum ea sit belli conditio ut hostes sint, omni jure, spoliati proscriptique, rationis est, quascunque res hostium, apud hostes inventas, Dominum mutare, et Fisco cedere." "Since it is a condition of war, that enemies, by every right, may be plundered, and seized upon, it is reasonable that whatever effects of the enemy are found with us who are his enemy, should change their master, and be confiscated, or go into the treasury." S.P. Lee on Capt. c. 8. p. 111. S.P. 2. Burl. p. 209. s. 12. p. 219. s. 2. p. 221 s. 11. Bynkershoek the same book, and chapter, page 177. thus expresses himself: "Quod dixi de actionibus recte publicandis ita demum obtinet. Si quod subditi nostri hostibus nosiris debent, princeps a subditis suis, revera exegerit: Si exegerit recte solutum est, si non exegerit, pace facta, reviviscit jus pristinum creditoris; quia occupatio, quÃ¦ bello fit, magis in facto, quam in potestate juris consistit. Nomina igitur, non exacta, tempore belli quodammodo intermori videntur, sed per pacem, genere quodam postliminii, ad priorem dominum reverti. Secundum bÂœc inter gentes fere convenit ut nominibus bello publicatis, pace deinde facta, exacta censeantur periisse, et maneant extincta; non autem exacta reviviscant, et restituantur veris creditoribus."</p>
<p>"What I have said of things in action being rightfully confiscated, "holds thus: If the prince truly exacts from his subjects, "what they owed to the enemy; if he shall have exacted "it, it is rightfully paid, if he shall not have exacted it, peace "being made, the former right of the creditor revives; because "the seizure, which is made during war, consists more in fact "than in right. Debts, therefore, not exacted, seem as it "were to be forgotten in time of war, but upon peace, by a "kind of postliminy, return to their former proprietor. Accordingly, "it is for the most part agreed among nations, "that things in action, being confiscated in war, the peace being "made, those which were paid are deemed to have perished, "and remain extinct; but those not paid revive, and are restored "to their true creditors. Vatt. lib. 4. s. 22. S.P. Lee "on Capt. c. 8. p 118."</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*227</span> That this is the law of nations, as held in Great Britain, appears from Sir Thomas Parker's Rep. p. 267 (11 William 3d) in which it was determined, that choses in action belonging to an alien enemy are forfeitable to the crown of Great Britain; but there must be a commission and inquisition to entitle the crown; and if peace is concluded before inquisition taken, it discharges the cause of forfeiture.</p>
<p>The right to confiscate the property of enemies, during war, is derived from a state of war, and is called the rights of war. This right originates from self-preservation, and is adopted as one of the means to weaken an enemy, and to strengthen ourselves. Justice, also, is another pillar on which it may rest; to wit, a right to reimburse the expence of an unjust war. Vatt. lib. 3. c. 8. s. 138, &amp; c. 9. s. 161.</p>
<p>But it is said, if Virginia had a right to confiscate British property, yet by the modern law, and practice of European nations, she was not justified in confiscating debts due from her citizens to subjects of Great Britain; that is, private debts. Vattell is the only author relied on (or that can be found) to maintain the distinction between confiscating private debts, and other property of an enemy. He admits the right to confiscate such debts, if the term of payment happen in the time of war; but this limitation on the right is no where else to be found. His opinion alone will not be sufficient to restrict the right to that case only. It does not appear in the present case, whether the time of payment happened before, or during the war. If this restriction is just, the Plaintiff ought to have shewn the fact. Vattell adds, "at present, in regard to the advantages and safety of commerce, all the sovereigns of Europe have departed from this rigour; and this custom has been generally received, and he who should act contrary to it (the custom) would injure the public faith." From these expressions it may be fairly inferred, that, by the rigour of the law of nations, private debts to enemies might be confiscated, as well as any other of their property; but that a general custom had prevailed in Europe to the contrary; founded on commercial reasons. The law of nations may be considered of three kinds, to wit, general, conventional, or customary. The first is universal, or established by the general consent of mankind, and binds all nations. The second is founded on express consent, and is not universal, and only binds those nations that have assented to it. The third is founded on TACIT consent; and is only obligatory on those nations, who have adopted it. The relaxation or departure from the strict rights of war to confiscate private debts, by the commercial nations of Europe, was not binding on the state of Virginia, because founded on custom only; and she was at liberty to reject, or adopt the custom, as she pleased <span class="star-pagination">*228</span> The conduct of nations at war, is generally governed and limited by their exigencies and necessities. Great Britain could not claim from the United States, or any of them, any relaxation of the general law of nations, during the late war, because she did not consider it, as a civil war, and much less as a public war, but she gave it the odious name of rebellion; and she refused to the citizens of the United States the strict rights of ordinary war.</p>
<p>It cannot be forgotten, that the Parliament of Great Britain, by statute (16 Geo. 3. c. 5. in 1776) declared, that the vessels and cargoes belonging to the people of Virginia, and the twelve other colonies, found and taken on the high seas, should be liable to seizure and confiscation, as the property of open enemies; and, that the mariners and crews should be taken and considered as having voluntarily entered into the service of the King of Great Britain; and that the killing and destroying the persons and property of the Americans, before the passing this act, was just and lawful: And it is well known that, in consequence of this statute, very considerable property of the citizens of Virginia was seized on the high seas, and confiscated; and that other considerable property, found within that Commonwealth, was seized and applied to the use of the British army, or navy. Vattel lib. 3. c. 12. sec. 191. says, and reason confirms his opinion, "That whatever is lawful for one nation to do, in time of war, is lawful for the other." The law of nations is part of the municipal law of Great Britain, and by her laws all moveable property of enemies, found within the kingdom, is considered as forfeited to the crown, as the head of the nation; but if no inquisition is taken to ascertain the owners to be alien enemies, before peace takes place, the cause of forfeiture is discharged, by the peace ipso facto, Sir Thomas Parker's Rep. pa. 267. This doctrine agrees with Bynk. lib. 1 c. 7. pa. 177. and Lee on Capt. ch. 8. p. 118. that debts not confiscated and paid, revive on peace. Lee says, "Debts, therefore, which are not taken hold of, seem, as it were, suspended and forgotten in time of war; but by a peace return to their former proprietor by a kind of postliminy." Mr. Lee, who wrote since Vattel, differs from him in opinion, that private debts are not confiscable, pag. 114. He thus delivers himself: "By the law of nations, Rights and Credits are not less in our power then other goods; why, therefore, should we regard the rights of war in regard to one, and not as to the other? And when nothing occurs, which gives room for a proper distinction, the general law of nations ought to prevail." He gives many examples of confiscating debts, and concludes, (p. 119) "All which prove, that not only actions, but all <span class="star-pagination">*229</span> other things whatsoever, are forfeited in time of war, and are often exacted."</p>
<p>Great Britain does not consider herself bound to depart from the rigor of the general law of nations, because the commercial powers of Europe with to adopt a more liberal practice. It may be recollected, that it is an established principle of the law of nations, "that the goods of a friend are free in an enemy's vessel; and an enemy's goods lawful prize in the vessel of a friend." This may be called the general law of nations. In 1780 the Empress of Russia proposed a relaxation of this rigor of the laws of nations, "That all the effects belonging to the subjects of the belligerent powers shall be free on board neutral vessels, except only contraband articles." This proposal was acceded to by the neutral powers of Sweden, Denmark, the States General of the United Provinces, Prussia and Portugal; France and Spain, two of the powers at war, did not oppose the principle, and Great Britain only declined to adopt it, and she still adheres to the rigorous principle of the law of nations. Can this conduct of Great Britain be objected to her as an uncivilized and barbarous practice? The confiscating private debts by Virginia has been branded with those terms of reproach, and very improperly in my opinion.</p>
<p>It is admitted, that Virginia could not confiscate private debts without a violation of the modern law of nations, yet if in fact, she has so done, the law is obligatory on all the citizens of Virginia, and on her Courts of Justice; and, in my opinion, on all the Courts of the United States. If Virginia by such conduct violated the law of nations, she was answerable to Great Britain, and such injury could only be redressed in the treaty of peace. Before the establishment of the national government, British debts could only be sued for in the state court. This, alone, proves that the several states possessed a power over debts. If the crown of Great Britain had, according to the mode of proceeding in that country, confiscated, or forfeited American debts, would it have been permitted in any of the courts of Westminster Hall, to have denied the right of the crown, and that its power was restrained by the modern law of nations? Would it not have been answered, that the British nation was to justify her own conduct; but that her courts were to obey her laws.</p>
<p>It appears to me, that there is another and conclusive ground, which effectually precluded any objection, since the peace, on the part of Great Britain, as a nation, or on the part of any of her subjects, against the right of Virginia to confiscate British debts, or any other British property, during the war; even on the admission that such confiscation was in violation of the ancient or modern law of nations.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*230</span> If the Legislature of Virginia confiscated or extinguished the debt in question, by the law of the 20th of October 1777, as the Defendants in error contend, this confiscation or extinguishment, took place in 1777, fiagrante Bello; and the definitive treaty of peace was ratified in 1783. What effects flow from a treaty of peace, even if the confiscation, or extinguishment of the debt was contrary to the law of nations, and the stipulation in the 4th article of the treaty does not provide for the recovery of the debt in question?</p>
<p>I apprehend that the treaty of peace abolishes the subject of the war, and that after peace is concluded, neither the matter in dispute, nor the conduct of either party, during the war, can ever be revived, or brought into contest again. All violencies, injuries, or damages sustained by the government, or people of either, during the war, are buried in oblivion; and all those things are implied by the very treaty of peace; and therefore not necessary to be expressed. Hence it follows, that the restitution of, or compensation for, British property confiscated, or extinguished, during the war, by any of the United States, could only be provided for by the treaty of peace; and if there had been no provision, respecting these subjects, in the treaty, they could not be agitated after the treaty, by the British government, much less by her subjects in courts of justice. If a nation, during a war, conducts herself contrary to the law of nations, and no notice is taken of such conduct in the treaty of peace, it is thereby so far considered lawful, as never afterwards to be revived, or to be a subject of complaint.</p>
<p>Vattel lib. 4. sect. 21. p. 121. says, "The state of things at the instant of the treaty, is held to be legitimate, and any change to be made in it requires an express specification in the treaty; consequently, all things not mentioned in the treaty, are to remain as they were at the conclusion of it. Â— All the damages caused during the war are likewise buried in oblivion; and no plea is allowable for those, the reparation of which is not mentioned in the treaty: They are looked on as if they had never happened." The same principle applies to injuries done by one nation to another, on occasion of, and during the war. See Grotius lib. 3. c. 8. sect. 4.</p>
<p>The Baron De Wolfuis, 1222, says, "De quibus nibil dietum ea manent quo sunt loco." Things of which nothing is said remain in the state in which they are.</p>
<p>It is the opinion of the celebrated and judicious Doctor Rutherforth, that a nation in a just war may seize upon any moveable goods of an enemy, (and he makes no distinction as to private debts) but that whilst the war continues, the nation has, of right, nothing but the custody of the goods taken; and <span class="star-pagination">*231</span> if the nation has granted to private captors (as privateers) the property of goods taken by them, and on peace, restitution is agreed on, that the nation is obliged to make restitution, and not the private captors; and if on peace no restitution is stipulated, that the full property of moveable goods, taken from the enemy during the war, passes, by tacit consent, to the nation that takes them. This I collect as the substance of his opinion in lib. 2. c. 9, from p. 558 to 573.</p>
<p>I shall conclude my observations on the right of Virginia to confiscate any British property, by remarking, that the validity of such a law would not be questioned in the Court of Chancery of Great Britain; and I confess the doctrine seemed strange to me in an American Court of Justice. In the case of Wright and Nutt, Lord Chancellor Thurlow declared, that he considered an act of the State of Georgia, passed in 1782, for the confiscation of the real and personal estate of Sir James Wright, and also his debts, as a law of an independent country; and concluded with the following observation, that the law of every country, must be equally regarded in the Courts of Justice of Great Britain, whether the law was a barbarous or civilised institution, or wife or foolish. H. Black, Rep. p. 149. In the case of Folliot against Ogden, Lord Loughborough, Chief Justice of the Court of Common Pleas, in delivering the judgment of the court, declared "that the act of the State of New York, passed in 1779, for attainting, forfeiting, and confiscating the real and personal estate of Folliott, the Plaintiff, was certainly of as full validity, as the act of any independent State. H. Black. Rep. p. 135. On a writ of error Lord Kenyon, Chief Justice of the Court of King's Bench, and Judge Grose, delivered direct contrary sentiments; but Judges Ashurst and Buller were silent. 3 Term Rep. p. 726.</p>
<p>From these observations, and the authority of Bynkersboek, Lee, Burlamaque, and Rutherforth, I conclude, that Virginia had a right, as a fovereign and independent nation, to confiscate any British property within its territory, unless she had before delegated that power to Congress, which Mr. Lewis contended she had done. The proof of the allegation that Virginia had transferred this authority to Congress, lies on those who make it; because if she had parted with such power it must be conceded, that she once rightfully possessed it.</p>
<p>It has been enquired what powers Congress possessed from the first meeting, in September 1774, until the ratification of the articles of consederation, on the 1st of March, 1781? It appears to me, that the powers of Congress, during that whole period, were derived from the people they represented, expressly given, through the medium of their State Conventions, or State Legislatures; or that after they were exercised they were <span class="star-pagination">*232</span> impliedly ratified by the acquiescence and obedience of the people. After the confederacy was compleated, the powers of Congress rested on the authority of the State Legislatures, and the implied ratifications of the people; and was a government over governments. The powers of Congress originated from necessity, and arose out of, and were only limited by, events or, in other words, they were revolutionary in their very nature. Their extent depended on the exigencies and necessities of public affairs. It was absolutely and indispensably necessary that Congress should possess the power of conducting the war against Great Britain, and therefore is not expressly given by all, (as it was by some of the States) I do not hesitate to say, that Congress did rightfully possess such power. The authority to make war, of necessity implies the power to make peace; or the war must be perpetual. I entertain this general idea, that the several States retained all internal sovereignty; and that Congress properly possessed the great rights of external sovereignty: Among others, the right to make treaties of commerce and alliance; as with France on the 6th of February 1778. In deciding on the powers of Congress, and of the several States, BEFORE the consederation, I see but one safe rule, namely, that all the powers ACTUALLY exercised by Congress, before that period were rightfully exercised, on the presumption not to be controverted, that they were so authorized by the people they represented, by an express, or implied grant; and that all the powers exercised by the State Conventions or State Legislatures were also rightfully exercised, on the same presumption of authority from the people. That Congress did not possess all the powers of war is self-evident from this consideration alone, that she never attempted to lay any kind of tax on the people of the United States, but relied altogether on the State Legislatures to impose taxes, to raise money to carry on the war, and to sink the emissions of all the paper money issued by Congress. It was expressly provided, in the 8th article of the consederation, that "all charges of war (and all other expences for the common defence and general welfare) and allowed by Congress, shall be defrayed out of a common Treasury, to be supplied by the several States in proportion to the value of the land in each State; and the taxes for paying the said proportion, shall be levied by the Legislatures of the several States." In every free country the power of laying taxes is considered a legislative power over the property and persons of the citizens; and this power the people of the United States, granted to their State Legislatures, and they neither could, nor did transfer it to Congress; but on the contrary they expressly stipulated that it should remain with them. It is an incontrovertible fact that Congress never attempted to consiscate <span class="star-pagination">*233</span> any kind of British property within the United States (except what their army, or vessels of war captured) and thence I conclude that Congress did not conceive the power was vested in them. Some of the states did exercise this power, and thence I infer, they possessed it. Â— On the 23d of March, 3d of April, and 24th of July, 1776, Congress confiscated British property, taken on the high seas.<sup>[*]</sup></p>
<p>The second point made by the council for the Plaintiff in error was, "if the legislature of Virginia had a right to confiscate British debts, yet she did not exercise that right by the act of the 20th October, 1777." If this objection is well founded, the Plaintiff in error must have judgment for the money covered by the plea of that law, and the payment under it. The preamble recites, that the pulic faith, and the law and the usage of nations require, that debts incurred, during the connexion with Great Britain, should not be confiscated. No language can possibly be stronger to express the opinion of the legislature of Virginia, that British debts ought not to be confiscated, and if the words or effect and operation, of the enacting clause, are ambiguous or doubtful, such construction should be made as not to extend the provisions in the enacting clause, beyond the intention of the legislature, so clearly expressed in the preamble; but if the words in the enacting clause, in their nature, import, and common understanding, are not ambiguous, but plain and clear, and their operation and effect certain, there is no room for construction. It is not an uncommon case for a legislature, in a preamble, to declare their intention to provide for certain cases, or to punish certain offences, and in enacting clauses to include other cases, and other offences. But I believe very few instances can be found in which the legislature declared that a thing ought not to be done, and afterwards did the very thing they reprobated. There can be no doubt that strong words in the enacting part of a law may extend it beyond the preamble. If the preamble is contradicted by the enacting clause, as to the intention of the legislature, it must prevail, on the principle that the legislature changed their intention.</p>
<p>I am of opinion, that the law of the 20th of October, 1777, and the payment in virtue thereof, amounts either to a confiscation, or extinguishment, of so much of the debt as was paid into the loan office of Virginia. 1st. The law makes it lawful for a citizen of Virginia indebted to a subject of Great Britain <span class="star-pagination">*234</span> to pay the whole, or any part, of his debt, into the loan office of that commonwealth. 2d. It directs the debtor to take a certificate of his payment, and to deliver it to the governor and the council; and it declares that the receipt of the governor and the council for the certificate shall discharge him (the debtor) from so much of the debt as he paid into the loan office. 3d. It enacts that the certificate shall be subject to the future direction of the legislature. And 4thly, it provides, that the governor and council may make such allowance, as they shall think reasonable, out of the INTEREST of the money paid, to the wives and children, residing within the state, of such creditor. The payment by the debtor into the loan office is made a lawful act. The public receive the money, and they discharge the debtor, and they make the certificate. (which is the evidence of the payment) subject to their direction; and they benevolently appropriate part of the money paid, to wit, the interest of the debt, to such of the family of the creditor as may live within the state. All these acts are plainly a legislative interposition between the creditor and debtor; annihilates the right of the creditor; and is an exercise of the right of ownership over the money; for the giving part to the family of the creditor, under the restriction of being residents of the state, or to a stranger, can make no difference. The government of Virginia had precisely the same right to dispose of the whole, as of part of the debt. Whether all these acts amount to a confiscation of the debt, or not, may be disputed according to the different ideas entertained of the proper meaning of the word confiscation. I am inclined to think that all these acts, collectively considered, are substantially a confiscation of the debt. The verb confiscate is derived from the latin, con with, and Fiscus a basket, or hamper, in which the Emperor's treasure was formerly kept. The meaning of the word to confiscate is to transfer property from PRIVATE to public use; or to forfeit property to the prince, or state. In the language of Mr. Lee, (page 118) the debt was taken hold of; and this he considers as confiscation. But if strictly speaking, the debt was not confiscated, yet it certainly was extinguished as between the creditor and debtor; the debt was legally paid, and of consequence extinguished. The state interfered and received the debt, and discharged the debtor from his creditor; and not from the state, as suggested. The debtor owed nothing to the state of Virginia, but she had a right to take the debt or not at her pleasure. To say that the discharge was from the state, and not from the debtor, implies that the debtor was under some obligation or duty to pay the state, what he owed his British creditor. If the debtor was to remain charged to his creditor, notwithstanding his payment; not one farthing would have been <span class="star-pagination">*235</span> paid into the loan office. Such a construction, therefore, is too vilent and not to be admitted. If Virginia had confiscated British debts, and received the debt in question, and said nothing more, the debtor would have been discharged by the operation of the law. In the present case, there is an express discharge on payment, certificate, and receipt.</p>
<p>It appears to me that the plea, by the Defendant, of the act of Assembly, and the payment agreeably to its provisions, which is admitted, is a bar to the plaintiff's action, for so much of his debt as he paid into the loan office; unless the plea is avoided, or destroyed, by the Plaintiff's replication of the fourth article of the Definitive Treaty of Peace, between Great Britain and the United States, on the 3d of September, 1783.</p>
<p>The question then may be stated thus: Whether the 4th article of the said treaty nullifies the law of Virginia, passed on the 20th of October, 1777; destroys the payment made under it; and revives the debt, and gives a right of recovery thereof, against the original debtor?</p>
<p>It was doubted by one of the counsel for the Defendants in error (Mr. Marshall) whether Congress had a power to make a treaty, that could operate to annul a legislative act of any of the states, and to destroy rights acquired by, or vested in individuals, in virtue of such acts. Another of the Defendant's council (Mr. Campbell) expressly, and with great zeal, denied that Congress possessed such power.</p>
<p>But a few remarks will be necessary to shew the inadmissibility of this objection to the power of Congress.</p>
<p>1st. The legislatures of all the states, have often exercised the power of taking the property of its citizens for the use of the public, but they uniformly compensated the proprietors. The principle to maintain this right is for the public good, and to that the interest of individuals must yield. The instances are many; and among them are lands taken for forts, magazines, or arsenals; or for public roads, or canals; or to erect towns.</p>
<p>2d. The legislatures of all the states have often exercised the power of divesting rights vested; and even of impairing, and, in some instances, of almost annihilating the obligation of contracts, as by tender laws, which made an offer to pay, and a refusal to receive, paper money, for a specie debt, an extinguishment, to the amount tendered.</p>
<p>3d. If the Legislature of Virginia could, by a law, annul any former law; I apprehend that the effect would be to destroy all rights acquired under the law so nullified.</p>
<p>4th. If the Legislature of Virginia could not by ordinary acts of legislation, do these things, yet possessing the supreme sovereign power of the state, the certainly could do them, by a treaty of peace; if she had not parted with the power or making <span class="star-pagination">*236</span> such treaty. If Virginia had such power before she delegated it to Congress, it follows, that afterwards that body possessed it. Whether Virginia parted with the power of making treaties of peace, will be seen by a perusal of the 9th article of the Confederation (ratified by all the states, on the 1st of March, 1781,) in which it was declared, "that the United States in Congress assembled, shall have the sole and exclusive right and power of determining on peace, or war, except in the two cases mentioned in the 6th article; and of entering into treaties and alliances, with a proviso, when made, respecting commerce." This grant has no restriction, nor is there any limitation on the power in any part of the confederation. A right to make peace, necessarily includes the power of determining on what terms peace shall be made. A power to make treaties must of necessity imply a power, to decide the terms on which they shall be made: A war between two nations can only be concluded by treaty.</p>
<p>Surely, the sacrificing public, or private, property, to obtain peace cannot be the cases in which a treaty would be void. Vatt. lib. 2 c. 12 s. 160, 161. p. 173. lib. 6. c. 2. s. 2. It seems to me that treaties made by Congress, according to the Confederation, were superior to the laws of the states; because the Confederation made them obligatory on all the states. They were so declared by Congress on the 13th of April, 1787; were so admitted by the legislatures and executives of most of the states; and were so decided by the judiciary of the general government, and by the judiciaries of some of the state governments.</p>
<p>If doubts could exist before the establishment of the present national government, they must be entirely removed by the 6th article of the Constitution, which provides "That all treaties made, or which shall be made, under the authority of the United States, shall be the Supreme law of the land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any thing in the Constitution, or laws, of any State to the contrary notwithstanding." There can be no limitation on the power of the people of the United States. By their authority the State Constitutions were made, and by their authority the Constitution of the United States was established; and they had the power to change or abolish the State Constitutions, or to make them yield to the general government, and to treaties made by then authority. A treaty cannot be the Supreme law of the land, that is of all the United States, if any act of a State Legislature can fraud in its way. If the Constitution of a State (which is the fundamental law of the State, and paramount to its Legislature) must give way to a treaty, and fall before it; can it be questioned, whether the less power, an act <span class="star-pagination">*237</span> of the State Legislature, must not be prostrate? It is the declared will of the people of the United States that every treaty made, by the authority of the United States, shall be superior to the Constitution and laws of any individual State; and their will alone is to decide. Â— If a law of a State, contrary to a treaty, is not void, but voidable only by a repeal, or nullification by a State Legislature, this certain consequence follows, that the will of a small part of the United States may controul or defeat the will of the whole. The people of America have been pleased to declare, that all treaties made before the establishment of the National Constitution, or laws of any of the States, contrary to a treaty, shall be disregarded.</p>
<p>Four things are apparent on a view of this 6th article of the National Constitution. 1st. That it is Retrospective, and is to be considered in the same light as if the Constitution had been established before the making of the treaty of 1783. 2d. That the Constitution, or laws, of any of the States so far as either of them shall be found contrary to that treaty are by force of the said article, prostrated before the treaty. 3d. That consequently the treaty of 1783 has superior power to the Legislature of any State, because no Legislature of any State has any kind of power over the Constitution, which was its creator. 4thly. That it is the declared duty of the State Judges to determine any Constitution, or laws of any State, contrary to that treaty (or any other) made under the authority of the United States, null and void. National or Federal Judges are bound by duty and oath to the same conduct<sup>[*]</sup>.</p>
<p>The argument, that Congress had not power to make the 4th article of the treaty of peace, if its intent and operation was to annul the laws of any of the States, and to destroy vested rights (which the Plaintiff's Council contended to be the object and effect of the 4th article) was unnecessary, but on the supposition that this court possess a power to decide, whether this article of the treaty is within the authority delegated to that body, by the articles of confederation. Whether this court constitutionally possess such a power is not necessary now to determine, because I am fully satisfied that Congress were invested with the authority to make the stipulation in the 4th article. If the court possess a power to declare treaties void, I shall never exercise it, but in a very clear case indeed. One further remark will shew how very circumspect the court ought to be before they would decide against the right of Congress to make the stipulation objected to. If Congress had no <span class="star-pagination">*238</span> power (under the confederation) to make the 4th article of the treaty, and for want of power that article is void, would it not be in the option of the crown of Great Britain to say, whether the other articles, in the same treaty, shall be obligatory on the British nation?</p>
<p>I will now proceed to the consideration of the treaty of 1783. It is evident on a perusal of it what were the great and principal objects in view by both parties. There were four on the part of the United States, to wit. 1st. An acknowledgment of their independence, by the crown of Great Britain. 2d. A settlement of their western bounds. 3d. The right of fishery: and 4thly. The free navigation of the Missisippi. There were three on the part of Great Britain, to wit, 1st. A recovery by British Merchants, of the value in sterling money, of debts contracted, by the citizens of America, before the treaty. 2d. Restitution of the confiscated property of real British subjects, and of persons residents in districts in possession of the British forces, and who had not borne arms against the United States; and a conditional restoration of the confiscated property of all other persons: and 3dly. A prohibition of all future confiscations, and prosecutions. The following facts were of the most public notoriety, at the time when the treaty was made, and therefore must have been very well known to the gentlemen who assented to it. 1st. That British debts, to a great amount, had been paid into some of the State Treasuries, or loan offices, in paper money of very little value, either under laws confiscating debts, or under laws authorising payment of such debts in paper money, and discharging the debtors. 2d. That tender laws had existed in all the states; and that by some of those laws, a tender and a refusal to accept, by principal or factor, was declared an extinguishment of the debt. From the knowledge that such laws had existed there was good reason to fear that similar laws, with the same or less consequences, might be again made, (and the fact really happened) and prudence required to guard the British creditor against them. 3d. That in some of the States property, of any kind, might be paid, at an appraisement, in discharge of any execution. 4th. That laws were in force in some of the States, at the time of the treaty, which prevented suits by British creditors. 5th. That laws were in force in other of the States, at the time of the treaty, to prevent suits by any person for a limited time. All these laws created legal impediments, of one kind or another, to the recovery of many British debts, contracted before the war; and in many cases compelled the receipt of property instead of gold and silver.</p>
<p>To secure the recovery of British debts, it was by the latter part of the 5th article, agreed as follows, "That all persons <span class="star-pagination">*239</span> who have any interest in confiscated lands, by DEBTS, should meet with no lawful impediment in the prosecution of their just rights." This provision clearly relates to debts secured by mortgages on lands in fee simple, which were afterwards confiscated; or to debts on judgments, which were a lien on lands, which also were afterwards confiscated, and where such debts on mortgages, or judgments, had been paid into the State Treasuries, and the debtors discharged. This stipulation was absolutely necessary if such debts were intended to be paid. The pledge, or security by lien, had been confiscated and sold. British subjects being aliens, could neither recover the possession of lands by ejectment, nor foreclose the equity of redemption; nor could they claim the money secured by a mortgage, or have the benefit of a lien from a judgment, if the debtor had paid his debt into the Treasury, and been discharged. If a British subject, in either of those cases, prosecuted his just right, it could only be in a court of justice, and if any of the above causes were set up as a lawful impediment, the courts were bound to decide, whether this article of the treaty nullified the laws confiscating the lands, and also the purchases made under them, or the laws authorizing payment of such debts to the State; or whether aliens were enabled, by this article, to hold lands mortgaged to them before the war. In all these cases, it seems to me, that the courts, in which the cases arose, were the only proper authority to decide, whether the case was within this article of the treaty, and the operation and effect of it. One instance among many will illustrate my meaning. Suppose a mortgagor paid the mortgage money into the public Treasury, and afterwards sold the land, would not the British creditor, under this article, be entitled to a remedy against the mortgaged lands?</p>
<p>The 4th article of the treaty is in these words: "It is agreed that creditors, on either side, shall meet with no lawful impediment to the recovery of the full value, in sterling money, of all bona fide debts, heretofore contracted."</p>
<p>Before I consider this article of the treaty, I will adopt the following remarks, which I think applicable, and which may be found in Dr. Rutherforth and Vattel. (2 Ruth. 307 to 315. Vattel lib. 2. c. 17. sect, 263 and 271.) The intention of the framers of the treaty, must be collected from a view of the whole instrument, and from the words made use of by them to express their intention, or from probable or rational conjectures. If the words express the meaning of the parties plainly, distinctly, and perfectly, there ought to be no other means of interpretation; but if the words are obscure, or ambiguous, or imperfect, recourse must be had to other means of interpretation, and in these three cases, we must collect the meaning from the words, <span class="star-pagination">*240</span> or from probable or rational conjectures, or from both. When we collect the intention from the words only, as they lie in the writing before us, it is a literal interpretation; and indeed if the words, and the construction of a writing, are clear and precise, we can scarce call it interpretation to collect the intention of the writer from thence. The principal rule to be observed in literal interpretation, is to follow that sense, in respect both of the words, and the construction, which is agreeable to common use.</p>
<p>If the recovery of the present debt is not within the clear and manifest intention and letter of the 4th article of the treaty, and if it was not intended by it to annul the law of Virginia, mentioned in the plea, and to destroy the payment under it, and to revive the right of the creditor against his original debtor; and if the treaty cannot effect all these things, I think the court ought to determine in favour of the Defendants in error. Under this impression, it is altogether unnecessary to notice the several rules laid down by the Council for the Defendants in error, for the construction of the treaty.</p>
<p>I will examine the 4th article of the treaty in its several parts; and endeavour to affix the plain and natural meaning of each part.</p>
<p>To take the 4th article in order as it stands.</p>
<p>1st. "It is agreed," that is, it is expressly contracted; and it appears from what follows, that certain things shall not take place. This stipulation is direct. The distinction is self-evident, between a thing that shall not happen, and an agreement that a third power shall prevent a certain thing being done. The first is obligatory on the parties contracting. The latter will depend on the will of another; and although the parties contracting, had power to lay him under a moral obligation for compliance, yet there is a very great difference in the two cases. This diversity appears in the treaty.</p>
<p>2d. "That creditors on either side," without doubt meaning British and American creditors.</p>
<p>3d. "Shall meet with no lawful impediment," that is, with no obstacle (or bar) arising from the common law, or acts of Parliament, or acts of Congress, or acts of any of the States, then in existence, or thereafter to be made, that would, in any manner, operate to prevent the recovery of such debts, as the treaty contemplated. A lawful impediment to prevent a recovery of a debt can only be matter of law pleaded in bar to the action. If the word lawful had been omitted, the impediment would not be confined to matter of law. The prohibition that no lawful impediment shall be interposed, is the same as that all lawful impediments shall be removed. The meaning cannot be satisfied by the removal of one impediment, and leaving another; and a <span class="star-pagination">*241</span> fortiori by taking away the less and leaving the greater. These words have both a retrospective and future aspect.</p>
<p>4th. "To the recovery," that is, to the right of action judgment, and execution, and receipt of the money, without impediments in courts of justice, which could only be by plea, (as in the present case) or by proceedings, after judgment, to compel receipt of paper money, or property, instead of sterling money. The word recovery is very comprehensive, and operates, in the present case, to give remedy from the commencement of suit, to the receipt of the money.</p>
<p>5th. "In the full value in sterling money," that is, British creditors shall not be obliged to receive paper money, or property at a valuation, or any thing else but the full value of their debts, according to the exchange with Great Britain. This provision is clearly restricted to British debts, contracted before the treaty, and cannot relate to debts contracted afterwards, which would be dischargeable according to contract, and the laws of the State where entered into. This provision has also a future aspect in this particular, namely, that no lawful impediment, no law of any of the States made after the treaty, shall oblige British creditors to receive their debts, contracted before the treaty, in paper money, or property at appraisement, or in any thing but the value in sterling money. The obvious intent of these words was to prevent the operation of past and future tender laws; or past and future laws, authorizing the discharge of executions for such debts by property at a valuation.</p>
<p>6th. "Of all bona fide debts," that is, debts of every species, kind, or nature, whether by mortgage, if a covenant therein for payment; or by judgments, specialties, or simple contracts. But the debts contemplated wee to be bona fide debts, that is, bona fide contracted before the peace, and contracted with good faith, or honestly, and without covin, and not kept on foot fraudulently. Bona fide is a legal technical expression; and the law of Great Britain and this country has annexed a certain idea to it. It is a term used in statutes in England, and in acts of Assembly of all the States, and signifies a thing done really, with a good faith, without fraud, or deceit, or collusion, or trust. The words bona fide are restrictive, for a debt may be for a valuable consideration, and yet not bona fide. A debt must be bona fide at the time of its commencement, or it never can become so afterwards. The words bona fide, were not prefixed to describe the nature of the debt at the date of the treaty, but the nature of the debt at the time it was contracted. Debts created before the war, were almost the only debts in the contemplation of the treaty; although debts contracted during the war were covered by the general provision, taking in debts from the most distant period of time, <span class="star-pagination">*242</span> to the date of the treaty. The recovery, where no lawful impediments were to be interposed, was to have two qualifications: 1st. The debts were to be bona fide contracted; and, 2d, they were to be contracted before the peace.</p>
<p>7th. "Heretofore contracted," that is, entered into at any period of time before the date of the treaty; without regard to the length or distance of time. These words are descriptive of the particular debts that might be recovered; and relate back to the time such debts were contracted. The time of the contract was plainly to designate the particular debts that might be recovered. A debt entered into during the war, would not have been recoverable, unless under this description of a debt contracted at any time before the treaty.</p>
<p>If the words of the 4th article taken separately, truly bear the meaning I have given them, their sense collectively, cannot be mistaken, and must be the same.</p>
<p>The next enquiry is, whether the debt in question, is one of those, described in this article. It is very clear that the article contemplated no debts but those contracted before the treaty; and no debts but only those to the recovery whereof some lawful impediment might be interposed. The present debt was contracted before the war, and to the recovery of it a lawful impediment, to wit, a law of Virginia and payment under it, is pleaded in bar. There can be no doubt that the debt sued for, is within the description, if I have given a proper interpretation of the words. If the treaty had been silent as to debts, and the law of Virginia had not been made, I have already proved that debts would, on peace, have revived by the law of nations. This alone shews that the only impediment to the recovery of the debt in question, is the law of Virginia, and the payment under it; and the treaty relates to every kind of legal impediment.</p>
<p>But it is asked, did the 4th article intend to annul a law of the states? and destroy rights acquired under it?</p>
<p>I answer, that the 4th article did intend to destroy all lawful impediments, past and future; and that the law of Virginia, and the payment under it, is a lawful impediment; and would bar a recovery, if not destroyed by this article of the treaty. This stipulation could not intend only to repeal laws that created legal impediments, to the recovery of the debt (without respect to the mode of payment) because the mere repeal of a law would not destroy acts done, and rights acquired, under the law, during its existence and before the repeal. This right to repeal was only admitted by the council for the Defendants in error, because a repeal would not affect their case; but on the same ground that a treaty can repeal a law of the state, it can nullify it. I have already proved, that a treaty can totally annibilate <span class="star-pagination">*243</span> any part of the Constitution of any of the individual states, that is contrary to a treaty. It is admitted that the treaty intended and did annul some laws of the states, to wit, any laws, past or future, that authorised a tender of paper money to extinguish or discharge the debt, and any laws, past or future, that authorised the discharge of executions by paper money, or delivery of property at appraisement; because if the words sterling money have not this effect, it cannot be shewn that they have any other. If the treaty could nullify some laws, it will be difficult to maintain that it could not equally annul others.</p>
<p>It was argued, that the 4th article was necessary to revive debts which had not been paid, as it was doubtful, whether debts not paid would revive on peace by the law of nations. I answer, that the 4th article was not necessary on that account, because there was no doubt that debts not paid do revive by the law of nations; as appears from Bynkershock, Lee, and Sir Thomas Parker. And if necessary, this article would not have this effect, because it revives no debts, but only those to which some legal impediment might be interposed, and there could be no legal impediment, or bar, to the recovery, after peace, of debts not paid, during the war to the state.</p>
<p>It was contended, that the provision is, that CREDITORS shall recover, &amp;c. and there was no creditor at the time of the treaty, because there was then no debtor, he having been legally discharged. The creditors described in the treaty, were not creditors generally, but only those with whom debts had been contracted, at some time before the treaty; and is a description of persons, and not of their rights. This adhering to the letter, is to destroy the plain meaning of the provision; because, if the treaty does not extend to debts paid into the state treasuries, or loan offices, it is very clear that nothing was done by the treaty as to those debts, not even so much as was stipulated for Royalists, and Refugees, to wit, a recommendation of restitution. Further, by this construction, nothing was done for British creditors, because the law of nations secured a recovery of their debts, which had not been confiscated and paid to the states; and if the debts paid in paper money, of little value, into the state treasuries, or loan offices, were not to be paid to them, the article was of no kind of value to them, and they were deceived. The article relates either to debts not paid, or, to debts paid into the treasuries, or loan offices. It has no relation to the first, for the reasons above assigned; and if it does not include the latter it relates to nothing.</p>
<p>It was said that the treaty secured British creditors from payment in paper money. This is admitted, but it is by force <span class="star-pagination">*244</span> and operation of the words, "in sterling money;" but then the words, "heretofore contracted," are to have no effect whatsoever; and it is those very words, and those only, that secure the recovery of the debts, paid to the states; because no lawful impediment is to be allowed to prevent the recovery of debts contracted at any time before the treaty.</p>
<p>But it was alledged, that the 4th article only stipulates, that there shall be no lawful impediment, &amp;c. but that a law of the state was first necessary to annul the law creating such impediment; and that the state is under a moral obligation to pass such a law; but until it is done, the impediment remains.</p>
<p>I consider the 4th article in this light, that it is not a stipulation that certain acts shall be done, and that it was necessary for the legislatures of individual states, to do those acts; but that it is an express agreement, that certain things shall not be permitted the American courts of justice; and that it is a contract, on behalf of those courts, that they will not allow such acts to be pleaded in bar, to prevent a recovery of certain British debts, "Creditors are to meet with no lawful impediment, &amp;c." As creditors can only sue for the recovery of their debts, in courts of justice; and it is only in courts of justice that a legal impediment can be set up by way of plea, in bar of their actions; it appears to me, that the courts are bound to overule every such plea, if contrary to the treaty. A recovery of a debt can only be prevented by a plea in bar to the action. A recovery of a debt in sterling money, can only be prevented by a like plea in bar to the action, as tender and refusal, to operate as an extinguishment. After judgment, payment thereof in sterling money can only be prevented by some proceedings under some law, that authorises the debtor to discharge an execution in paper money, or in property, at a valuation. In all these, and similar cases, it appears to me, that the courts of the United States are bound, by the treaty, to interfere. No one can doubt that a treaty may stipulate, that certain acts shall be done by the Legislature; that other acts shall be done by the Executive; and others by the Judiciary. In the 6th article it is provided, that no future prosecutions shall be commenced against any person, for or by reason of the part he took in the war. Under this article the American courts of justice discharged the prosecutions, and the persons, on receipt of the treaty, and the proclamation of Congress. 1 Dall. Rep. 233.</p>
<p>If a law of the State to annul a former law was first necessary, it must be either on the ground that the treaty could not annul any law of a State; or that the words used in the treaty were not explicit or effectual for that purpose. Our Federal Constitution establishes the power of a treaty over the constitution <span class="star-pagination">*245</span> and laws of any of the States; and I have shewn that the words of the 4th article were intended, and are sufficient to nullify the law of Virginia, and the payment under it. It was contended that Virgnia is interested in this question, and ought to compensate the Defendants in error, if obliged to pay the Plaintiff under the treaty. If Virginia had a right to receive the money, which I hope I have clearly established, by what law is the obliged to return it? The treaty only speaks of the original debtor, and says nothing about a recovery from any of the States.</p>
<p>It was said that the defendant ought to be fully indemnified, if the treaty compels him to pay his debt over again; as his rights have been sacrificed for the benefit of the public.</p>
<p>That Congress had the power to sacrifice the rights and interests of private citizens to secure the safety or prosperity of the public, I have no doubt; but the immutable principles of justice; the public faith of the States, that confiscated and received British debts, pledged to the debtors; and the rights of the debtors violated by the treaty; all combine to prove, that ample compensation ought to be made to all the debtors who have been injured by the treaty for the benefit of the public. This principle is recognized by the Constitution, which declares, "that private property shall not be taken for public use without just compensation." See Vattel. lib. 1. c. 20. s. 244.</p>
<p>Although Virginia is not bound to make compensation to the debtors, yet it evident that they ought to be indemnified, and it is not to be supposed, that those whose duty it may be to make the compensation, will permit the rights of our citizens to be sacrificed to a public object, without the fullest indemnity.</p>
<p>On the best investigation I have been able to give the 4th article of the treaty, I cannot conceive, that the wisdom of men could express their meaning in more accurate and intelligible words, or in words more proper and effectual to carry their intention into execution. I am satisfied, that the words, in their natural import, and common use, give a recovery to the British creditor from his original debtor of the debt contracted before the treaty, notwithstanding the payment thereof into the public treasuries, or loan offices, under the authority of any State law; and, therefore, I am of opinion, that the judgment of the Circuit Court ought to be reversed, and that judgment ought to be given, on the demurrer, for the Plaintiff in error; with the costs in the Circuit Court, and the costs of the appeal.</p>
<p>PATERSON, Justice.</p>
<p>The present suit is instituted on a bond bearing date the 7th of July 1774, and executed by Daniel Lawrence Hylton &amp; Co. and Francis Eppes, citizens of the State of Virginia, to Joseph Farrel and William Jones, subjects <span class="star-pagination">*246</span> of the king of Great Britain, for the payment of Â£2,976 11s. 6d. British, or sterling, money.</p>
<p>The Defendants, among other pleas, pleaded,</p>
<p>1st. Payment; on which issue is joined.</p>
<p>2d. That 3111 1-9 dollars, equal to, Â£933 14s. od. part of the debt mentioned in the declaration, were, on the 26th of April 1780, paid by them into the loan office of Virginia pursuant to an act of that State, passed the 20th of October 1777, entitled, "An act for sequestering British property, enabling "those indebted to British subjects to pay off such debts, and "directing the proceedings in suits where such subjects are "parties". The material section of the act is recited in the plea.</p>
<p>To this plea the Plaintiffs reply, and set up the 4th article of the treaty, made the 3d. of September 1783, between the United States and his Britannic Majesty, and the Constitution of the United States making treaties the supreme law of the land.</p>
<p>The rejoinder sets forth, that the debt in the declaration mentioned, or so much thereof as is equal to the sum of Â£933 14s. od. was not a bona fide debt due and owing to the Plaintiffs on the 3d of September 1783, because the Defendants had, on the 26th of April 1780, paid, in part thereof, the sum of 3111 1-9 dollars into the loan office of Virginia, and obtained a certificate and receipt therefor pursuant to the directions of the said act; without that, that the said treaty of peace, and the Constitution of the United States entitle the Plaintiffs to maintain their action against the Defendants for so much of the said debt in the declaration mentioned as is equal to Â£933 14s.</p>
<p>To this rejoinder the Plaintiffs demur.</p>
<p>The defendants join in demurrer.</p>
<p>On this issue in law judgment was entered for the Defendants in the Circuit Court for the District of Virginia. A Writ of Error has been brought, and the general errors are assigned.</p>
<p>The question is, whether the judgment rendered in the Circuit Court be erroneous? I shall not pursue the range of discussion, which was taken by the Counsel on the part of the Plaintiffs in error. I do not deem it necessary to enter on the question, whether the Legislature of Virginia had authority to make an act, confiscating the debts due from its citizens to the subjects of the king of Great Britain, or whether the authority in such case was exclusively in Congress. I shall read and make a few observations on the act, which has been pleaded in bar, and then pass to the consideration of the 4th <span class="star-pagination">*247</span> article of the treaty. The first and third sections are the only parts of the act necessary to be considered.</p>
<p>1st. "Whereas divers persons, subjects of Great Britain, "had, during our connexion with that kingdom, acquired estates, "real and personal, within this commonwealth, and had "also become entitled to debts to a considerable amount, and "some of them had commenced suits for the recovery of such "debts before the present troubles had interrupted the administration "of justice, which suits were at that time depending "and undetermined, and such estates being acquired and debts "incurred, under the sanction of the laws and of the connexion "then subsisting, and it not being known that their sovereign "hath as yet set the example of confiscating debts and "estates under the like circumstances, the public faith, and "the law and usages of nations require, that they should not "be confiscated on our part, but the safety of the United "States demands, and the same law and usages of nations will "justify, that we should not strengthen the hands of our enemies "during the continuance of the present war, by remitting "to them the profits or proceeds of such estates, or the "interest or principal of such debts."</p>
<p>3d. "And be it further enacted, that it shall and may be "lawful for any citizen of this commonwealth, owing money "to a subject of Great Britain, to pay the same, or any part "thereof, from time to time, as he shall think fit, into the "said loan office, taking thereout a certificate for the same in "the name of the creditor, with an endorsement under the "hand of the commissioner of the said office expressing the "name of the payer, and shall deliver such certificate to the "Governor and Council, whose receipt shall discharge him "from so much of the debt. And the Governor and Council "shall in like manner lay before the General Assembly, "once in every year, an account of these certificates, specifying "the names of the persons by and for whom they were "paid, and shall fee to the safe-keeping of the same, subject "to the future direction of the Legislature."</p>
<p>The act does not confiscate debts due to British subjects. The preamble reprobates the doctine as being inconsistent with public faith, and the law and usages of nations. The payments made into the loan office were voluntary and not compulsive; for it was in the option of the debtor to pay or not. The enacting clause will admit of a construction in full consistency with the preamble; for, although the certificates were to be subject to the future direction of the Legislature, yet it was under the express declaration, that there should be no confiscation, unless the King of Great Britain should set the example; if he should confiscate debts due to the citizens <span class="star-pagination">*248</span> of Virginia, then the Legislature of Virginia would confiscate debts due to British subjects. But the King of Great Britain did not confiscate debts on his part, and the Legislature of Virginia have not confiscated debts on their part. It is, however, said, that the payment being made under the act, the faith of Virginia is plighted. True Â— but to whom is it plighted Â— to the creditor or debtor Â— to the alien enemy, or to its own citizen, who made the voluntary payment? Or will it be shaped and varied according to the event Â— if one way, then to the creditor; if another, then to the debtor. Be these points as they may, the Legislature thought it expedient to declare to what amount Virginia should be bound for payments so made. The act for this purpose was passed on the 3d of January, 1780; and is entitled "An act concerning monies paid into "the public loan office, in payment of British debts."</p>
<p>"Section 1. Whereas by an act of the General Assembly, "entitled `An act for sequestering British property, enabling "those indebted to British subjects, to pay off such debts, and "directing the proceedings in suits where such subjects are "parties;" it is among other things provided, that it shall and "may be lawful for any citizen of this commonwealth, owing "money to a subject of Great Britain, to pay the same, or any "part thereof, from time to time, as he shall think fit, into the "said loan office, taking thereout a certificate for the same, in "the name of the creditor; with an indorsement under the hand "of the commissioner of the said office, expressing the name of "the payer; and shall deliver such certificate to the governor "and council, whose receipt shall discharge him from so much "of the debt; and the Governor and Council shall, in like manner, "lay before the General Assembly, once in every year, an "account of these certificates, specifying the names of the persons, "by and for whom they were paid, and shall fee to the safe "keeping of the same, subject to the future direction of the Legislature.</p>
<p>"Sect. 2. And whereas it belongs not to the Legislature to "decide particular questions, of which the judiciary have cognizance, "and it is therefore unfit for them to determine, whether "the payments so made into the loan office, as aforesaid, be good "or void between the creditor and debtor. But it is expedient "to declare to what amount this commonwealth may be bound "for the payments aforesaid. Be it enacted and declared, That "this commonwealth shall, at no time nor in any event or contingency, "be liable to any person or persons whatsoever, for "any sum, on account of the payments aforesaid, other than the "value thereof when reduced by the scale of depreciation, established "by one other act of the General Assembly, entitled "An act directing the mode of adjusting and settling the payment <span class="star-pagination">*249</span> "of certain debts and contracts, and for other purposes, "with interest thereon, at the rate of six per centum per annum; "any law, usage, custom, or any adjudication or construction "of the first recited act already made, or hereafto "be made notwithstanding."</p>
<p>On the part of the Defendants, it has been also urged, that it is immaterial whether the payment be voluntary or compulsive, because the payer, on complying with the directions of the act, shall be discharged from so much of the debt. Be it so. If the Legislature had authority to make the act, the Congress could, by treaty, repeal the act, and annul every thing done under it. This leads us to consider the treaty and its operation. Treaties must be construed in such manner, as to effectuate the intention of the parties. The intention is to be collected from the letter and spirit of the instrument, and may be illustrated and enforced by considerations deducible from the situation of the parties; and the reasonableness, justice, and nature of the thing, for which provision has been made. The 4th article of the treaty gives the text, and runs in the following words:</p>
<p>"It is agreed, that creditors on either side, shall meet with no "legal impediment to the recovery of the full value in sterling "money, of all bona fide debts heretofore contracted."</p>
<p>The phraseology made use of, leaves in my mind no room to hesitate as to the intention of the parties. The terms are unequivocal and universal in their signification, and obviously point to and comprehend all creditors, and all debtors, previously to the 3d of September, 1783. In this article there appears to be a selection of expressions plain and extensive in their import, and admirably calculated to obviate doubts, to remove difficulties, to designate the objects, and ascertain the intention of the contending powers, and, in short, to meet and provide for all possible cases that could arise under the head or debts. The words "creditors on either side," embrace every description of creditors, and cannot be limited or narrowed down to such only, whose debtors had not paid into the loan office of Virginia. Creditors must have debtors; debtors is the correlative term. Who are these debtors? On the part of the Defendants in error, it has been contended, that Virginia is the substituted debtor, so far as repects debtors, who may have paid money into the loan office under its laws. But the idea, that the treaty may be satisfied by substituting the state of Virginia in the stead of the original debtor, is far fetched, and altogether inadmissible. The terms in which the article is expressed, clearly evince a contrary intention, and naturally and irresistably carry the mind back to the original debtor; for, as between the British creditor and the <span class="star-pagination">*250</span> state of Virginia, there was no express and pre-existing stipulation or debt. Besides, what lawful impediment was to be removed out of the way of the creditor, if Virginia was the substituted or self-created debtor? Did this clause make Virginia liable to a prosecution for the debt? Is Virginia now suable by such British creditor? No; he would in such case be totally remediless, unless the nation of which he is a subject, would interpose in his behalf. The words "shall meet with no lawful impediment," refer to legislative acts, and every thing done under them, so far as the creditor might be affected or obstructed in regard either to his remedy or right. All lawful impediments of whatever kind they might be, whether they related to personal disabilities, or confiscations, sequestrations, or payments into loan offices or treasuries, are removed. No act of any state legislature, and no payment made under such act into the public coffers, shall obstruct the creditor in his course of recovery against his debtor. The act itself is a lawful impediment, and therefore is repealed; the payment under the act is also a lawful impediment, and therefore is made void. The article is to be construed according to the subject matter or nature of the impediment; it repeals in the first instance, and nullifies in the second. Unless this be the construction, it is not true, that the creditor shall meet with no legal impediment to the recovery of his debt. Does not the plea in the present case contradict the treaty, and raise an impediment in the way of recovery, when the treaty declares there shall be none? Payments made in paper money into loan offices, and treasuries, were the principal impediments to be removed, and mischiefs to be redressed. The article makes provision accordingly. It stipulates, that the creditor shall recover the full value of his debt in sterling money; hereby securing and guarding him against all payments in paper money. Suppose the creditor should call on Virginia for payment Â— what would it be Â— the paper money paid into the loan office, or its value. Would this be a compliance with the article? In the one case, the money being cried down and dead, is no better than waste paper; and in the other, the payment, when reduced by the table of depreciation, would be inconsiderable, and in many cases not more than six-pence in the pound. Can this be called payment to the full value of the debt in sterling money? The subsequent expressions in the article, enforce the preceding observations, and mark the will and intention of the contracting parties, in the most clear and precise terms. The concluding words are, "all bona fide debts heretofore contracted." In the construction of contracts, words are to be taken in their natural and obvious meaning, unless some good reason be assigned, to shew, <span class="star-pagination">*251</span> that they should be understood in a different sense. Now, if a person, in reading this article, should take the words in their common meaning, and as generally understood, could he mistake the intention of the parties? Their design unquestionably was, to restore the creditor and debtor to their original state, and place them precisely in the situation they would have stood, if no war had intervened, or act of the Legislature of Virginia had been passed. The impediments created by Legislative acts, and the payments made in pursuance of them, and all the evils growing out of them, were, so far as respected creditors, done away and cured. This is the only way in which all lawful impediments can be removed, and all debts, contracted before the date of the treaty, can be recovered to their full value, by the creditors against their debtors. It has, however, been urged, that this article must be restricted to debts existing and due at the time of making the treaty; that the debt in question was discharged, because it has been paid into the Loan Office, agreeably to law; and that the treaty ought not to be construed so as to renovate or revive it. To enforce this objection, the rule laid down by Vattel was relied on, "that the state of things at "the instant of the treaty, is to be held legitimate, and any "change to be made in it requires an express specification in "the treaty; consequently all things not mentioned in the "treaty, are to remain as they were at the conclusion of it." Vatt. B. 4. c. 2. s. 21. The first part of the objection has been already answered; for it is within both the letter and spirit of the instrument, that the creditors should be reinstated, and, of course, that the debtors should be liable to pay. The act of Virginia, and the payment under it have, so far as the creditor is concerned, no operation, and are void. There is no difficulty in answering the objection arising from the passage in Vattel. The universality of the terms is equal to an express specification in the treaty, and indeed includes it. For it is fair and conclusive reasoning, that if any description of debtors or class of cases was intended to be excepted, it would have been specified in the instrument, and the words, "that creditors "on either side, shall meet with no lawful impediment to "the recovery of the full value in sterling money of all debts "heretofore contracted," would not have been made use of in the unqualified manner, in which they stand in the treaty. Another article in the treaty now under review, will serve by way of illustration.</p>
<p>"ARTICLE VII. There shall be a firm and perpetual peace "between his Britannic Majesty and the said States, and between "the subjects of the one and the citizens of the other, wherefore "all hostilities both by sea and land shall then immediately cease: "all prisoners on both sides shall be set at liberty, and his Britannic <span class="star-pagination">*252</span> "Majesty shall, with all convenient speed, and without causing "any destruction, or carrying away any negroes or other "property of the American inhabitants, withdraw all his armies, "garrisons and fleets from the said United States, and from every "port, place and harbour within the same; leaving in all fortifications "the American artillery that may be therein. And shall "also order and cause all archives, records, deeds, and papers, "belonging to any of the said States, or their citizens, which in "the course of the war may have fallen into the hands of his officers, "to be forthwith restored and delivered to the proper States "and persons to whom they belong." Would it be an objection on the part of his Britannic Majesty, that the state of things at the instant of the treaty is to be held legitimate, and any change to be made in it, requires an express specification? That the sorts are not specified, and therefore not to be given up? The objection would be considered as futile and evasive. The answer would be, that there is no doubt, because the expressions are general, comprehend the forts, and are equal to an express specification. So in the present case, the universality of the terms are equal to a specification of every particular debt, or an enumeration of every creditor and debtor. It is the fame thing as though they had been individually named. All the creditors on either side, without distinction, must have been contemplated by the parties in the fourth article. Almost every word, separately taken, is expressive of this idea, and when all the words are combined and taken together, they remove every particle of doubt. But if the class of British creditors, whose debtors have paid into the Loan Office of Virginia, are not comprehended in the fourth article, then they pass without redress, without notice, without so much as a recommendation in their favour. The thing is incredible. Why a distinction Â— why should the creditors, whose debtors paid into the Loan Office, be in a worse situation than the creditors, whose debtors did not thus pay? The traders, and others of this country, were largely indebted to the merchants of Great Britain. To provide for the payment of these debts, and give satisfaction to this class of subjects, must have been a matter of primary importance to the British ministry. This, doubtless, is at all times, and in all situations, an object of moment to a commercial country. The opulence, resources, and power of the British nation, may, in no small degree, be ascribed to its commerce; it is a nation of manufacturers and merchants. To protect their interests and provide for the payment of debts due to them, especially when those debts amounted to an immense sum, could not fail of arresting the attention, and calling forth the utmost exertions of the British cabinet. A measure of this kind, it is easy to perceive, would be pursued with unremitting <span class="star-pagination">*253</span> diligence and ardour; sacrifices would be made to ensure its success; and, perhaps, nothing short of extreme necessity would induce them to give it up. But, if the debts, which have been confiscated, or paid into loan offices, or treasuries, be not within the provision of the fourth article, then a numerous class of British merchants are passed over in silence, aud not so much attended to as the loyalists, or Americans, who attached themselves to the cause of Britain during the war. Is it a supposable case, that the British negociators would have been more regardful of the interests of the loyalists than of their own merchants? That they would make a discrimination between merchants, when in a national and political view, and in the eye of justice, they were equally merritorious, and entitled to receive complete satisfaction for their debts? No line should be drawn between creditors unless it be found in the treaty. The treaty does not make it: the truth is, that none was intended; for, if intended, it would have been expressed. The indefinite and sweeping terms made use of by the parties, such as "creditors on either side, no lawful impediment to the recovery of the full value in sterling money, of all debts heretofore contracted," exclude the idea of any class of cases having been intended to be excepted, and explode the doctrine of constructive discrimination. The fourth article appears to me to come within the first general maxim of interpretation laid down by Vattel. "It is not permitted to interpret what has no need of "interpretation. When an act is conceived in clear and precise "terms, when the sense is manifest, and leads to nothing "absurd, there can be no reason to refuse the sense which this "treaty naturally presents. To go elsewhere in search of conjectures, "in order to restrain or extinguish it, is to endeavour "to elude it. If this dangerous method be once admitted, "there will be no act which it will not render useless. Let "the brightest light shine on all the parts of the piece, let it "be expressed in terms the most clear and determinate; all this "shall be of no use, if it be allowed to search for foreign reasons, "in order to maintain what cannot be found in the sense it "naturally presents." Vatt. B. 2. ch. 17. s. 263.</p>
<p>To proceed, the construction on the part of the defendants excludes mutuality. The debts due from British subjects to American citizens were not confiscated, or sequestered, or drawn into the public coffers. They were left untouched. Now, if all the British debtors be compelled to pay their American creditors, and a part only of the American debtors be compelled to pay their British creditors, there will not be that mutuality in the thing, which its nature and justice require. The rule in such case should work both ways: Whereas the other construction creates mutuality, and proceeds upon <span class="star-pagination">*254</span> indiscriminating principles. The former construction does violence to the letter and spirit of the instrument; the latter flows easily and naturally out of it.</p>
<p>It has been made a question, whether the confiscation of debts, which were contracted by individuals of different nations in time of peace, and remain due to individuals of the enemy in time of war, is authorised by the law of nations among civilized states? I shall not, however, controvert the position, that, by the rigour of the law of nations, debts of the description just mentioned, may be confiscated. This rule has by some been considered as a relict of barbarism; it is certainly a hard one, and cannot continue long among commercial nations; indeed, it ought not to have existed among any nations, and, perhaps, is generally exploded at the present day in Europe. Hear the language of Vattell on this subject, B. 3. "c. 5. s. 77. "But at present, in regard to the advantage "and safety of commerce, all the sovereigns of Europe have "departed from this rigor. And as this custom has been generally "received, he who should act contrary to it, would injure "the public faith; for strangers trusted his subjects only "from a firm persuasion, that the general custom would be "observed. The state does not so much as touch the sums "which it owes to the enemy. Every where, in case of war, "funds credited to the public are exempt from confiscation, "and seizure." The Legislators of Virginia, who made the act, which has been pleaded in bar, lay down the doctrine relative to this point, in strong and unequivocal terms. For, they expressly declare, that the law and usages of nations require, that debts should not be confiscated. If the enemy should, in the first instance, direct a confiscation of debts, retaliation might in such case be a proper and justifiable measure. The truth is, that the confiscation of debts is at once unjust and impolitic; it destroys confidence, violates good faith, and injures the interests of commerce; it is also unproductive, and in most cases impracticable. Ingenious writers have endeavoured to defend the doctrine on the ground, that the confiscation of debts weakens the enemy and enriches ourselves. The first is not true, because remittances are seldom, if ever, made during a war, and the second generally proves unprofitable, when attempted to be carried into practice. The gain is, at most, temporary, and inconsiderable; whereas the injury is certain and incalculable, and the ignominy great and lasting. History furnishes a remarkable instance in support and illustration of the foregoing remarks. For, in the war that broke out between France and Spain in the year 1684, his Catholic Majesty endeavoured to seize the effects of the subjects of France in his kingdom; but the attempt proved <span class="star-pagination">*255</span> abortive, for not one Spanish agent or factor violated his trust, or betrayed his French principal or correspondent. If the payments, which have been made into the loan office, pursuant to the act of Virginia, should be scaled according to a subsequent act of that state, they would not, it is probable, amount to a very large sum. Other reasons in support of the doctrine have been assigned, namely, that the confiscation of debts operates as an indemnity for past losses, and a security aginst future injuries; but they do not appear to me to be more solid than those already mentioned. Confiscation of debts is considered a disreputable thing among civilized nations of the present day; and indeed nothing is more strongly evincive of this truth, than that it has gone into general dessuetude, and whenever put into practice, provision is made by the treaty, which terminates the war, for the mutual and complete restoration of contracts and payment of debts. I feel no hesitation in declaring, that it has always appeared to me to be incompatible with the principles of justice and policy, that contracts entered into by individuals of different nations, should be violated by their respective governments in consequence of national quarrels and hostilities. National differences should not affect private bargains. The confidence, both of an individual and national nature, on which the contracts were founded, ought to be preserved inviolate. Is not this the language of honesty and honor? Does not the sentiment correspond with the principles of justice, and the dictates of the moral sense? In short, is it not the result of right reason and natural equity? The relation, which the parties stood in to each other at the time of contracting these debts, ought not to pass without notice. The debts were contracted while the creditors and debtors were subjects of the same king, and children of the same family. They were made under the sanction of laws common to, and binding on, both. A revolution-war could not, like other wars, be foreseen or calculated upon. The thing was improbable. No one, at the time that the debts were contracted, had any idea of a severance or dismemberment of the empire, by which persons, who had been united under one system of civil polity, should be torn asunder, and become enemies for a time, and, perhaps, aliens forever. Contracts entered into in such a state of things ought to be sacredly regarded. Inviolability seems to be attached to them. Considering then the usages of civilized nations, and the opinion of modern writers, relative to confiscation, and also the circumstances under which these debts were contracted, we ought to take the expressions in this fourth article in their most extensive sense. We ought to admit of no comment, that will narrow and restrict their operation and <span class="star-pagination">*256</span> import. The construction of a treaty made in favor of such creditors, and for the restoration and enforcement of pre-existing contracts, ought to be liberal and benign. For these reasons this clause in the treaty deserves the utmost latitude of exposition. The fourth article embraces all creditors, extends to all pre-existing debts, removes all lawful impediments, repeals the legislative act of Virginia, which has been pleaded in bar, and with regard to the creditor annuls every thing done under it. This article reinstates the parties; the creditor and debtor before the war, are creditor and debtor since; as they stood then, they stand now. To prevent mistakes, it is to be understood, that my argument embraces none but lawful impediments within the meaning of the treaty, such as legislative acts, and payments under them into loan offices and treasuries. An impediment created by law stands on different ground from an impediment created by the creditor. To conclude: I am of opinion, that the demurrer ought to have been sustained; and, of course, that the judgment rendered in the court below, is erroneous; and must be reversed.</p>
<p>IREDELL, Justice<sup>[*]</sup>.</p>
<p>In delivering my opinion on this important case, I feel myself deeply affected by the awful situation in which I stand. The uncommon magnitude of the subject, its novelty, the high expectation it has excited, and the consequences with which a decision may be attended, have all impressed me with their fullest force. I have trembled left by an ill informed or precipitate opinion of mine, either the honour, the interest, or the safety of the United States should suffer or <span class="star-pagination">*257</span> be endangered on the one hand, or the just rights and proper security of any individual on the other. In endeavouring to form the opinion I shall now deliver, I am sure the great object of my heart has been to discover the true principles upon which a decision ought to be given, unbiassed by any other consideration than the most sacred regard to justice. Happy should I have thought myself, if I could as confidently have relied on a strength of abilities equal to the greatness of the occasion.</p>
<p>The cause has been spoken to, at the bar, with a degree of ability equal to any occasion. However painfully I may at any time reflect on the inadequacy of my own talents, I shall as long as I live remember with pleasure and respect the arguments which I have heard on this case: they have discovered an ingenuity, a depth of investigation, and a power of reasoning fully equal to any thing I have ever witnessed, and some of them have been adorned with a splendor of eloquence surpassing what I have ever felt before. Fatigue has given way under its influence, and the heart has been warmed, while the understanding has been instructed.</p>
<p>The action now before the court is an action of debt, brought by a British creditor against an American debtor, to recover upon a bond executed before the late war.</p>
<p>To this action there are five pleas, substantially as follow.</p>
<p>The 1st, a plea of payment, on which issue is joined, but not now before the court, and which is to be tried by a jury, in case judgment be given for the Plaintiff upon the legal questions arising on the other pleas, so as to entitle him to try the the issue.</p>
<p>The 2d is a plea of a payment into the treasury of the State, of part of the debt, under an act of assembly of the 20th of October, 1777.</p>
<p>The 3d. plea is grounded on two acts of assembly: One of May 1779, under which it is alledged that the debt in question became forfeited to the State; the other of May 1782, which is relied on as a bar to the recovery. The former part of the plea I understand to be given up by the defendant's counsel, and certainly with great propriety, because debtsare expressly excepted in the act it refers to.</p>
<p>The 4th plea alledges a non-compliance with the treaty on the part of Great Britain, and, therefore, that the British creditor cannot now recover a benefit under the same treaty. It also alledges acts of hostility by Great Britain since the peace, as likewise forming a bar to the recovery of the Plaintiff, who is a British creditor.</p>
<p>The 5th plea is, that this debt was absolutely annulled by the change of government. This also I understand to have <span class="star-pagination">*258</span> been given up in the course of the argument, and undoubtedly it is not tenable.</p>
<p>The only pleas, therefore, for us to consider, are the second, part of the third, and the fourth. Every thing I have to say on that part of the 3d, not relinquished, admitting the fullest operation of the act of 1782, as intending to affect British creditors themselves, as well as assignees, which does not appear to me to have formed any part of its object, will appear from my observations on the second plea; and, therefore, to prevent unnecessary repetition, I shall not consider it separately by itself.</p>
<p>It seems proper to speak of the fourth plea first, because, if that can be maintained, it is altogether immaterial to consider either of the others.</p>
<p>I am clearly of opinion, that the fourth plea is not maintainable.</p>
<p>It is grounded on two allegations.</p>
<p>1st. The breach of the treaty by Great Britain, as alledged in the plea.</p>
<p>2d. Now acts of hostility on the part of that kingdom.</p>
<p>1. In regard to the first, I consider the law of nations to be decided as to the following position, viz:</p>
<p>"That if a treaty be broken by one of the contracting parties "it becomes (in the expressive language of the law) not "absolutely void, but voidable; and voidable, not at the option "of any individual of the contracting country injured, however "much he may be affected by it, but at the option of the sovereign "power of that country, of which such individual is a "member". The authorities, I think, are full and decisive to that effect. Grotius, b. 2. c. 15. s. 15. ib. b. 3. c. 20. s. 35, 36, 37, 38. 2. Burl. p. 355. part 4. c. 14. in s. 8. Vattel, b. 4. c. 4. s. 54.</p>
<p>The gentlemen for the defendant, taking hold of some particular expressions, without regarding the whole of these authorities, and considering the reason of them, have argued, that true, in the present instance (for example) Congress might have remitted the infraction, but not having done so, the Plaintiff is barred for the present, however he might be restored to the right, in case the infraction should hereafter be actually remitted.</p>
<p>But to me it is very evident, that such a position is not maintainable, either by the authorities I have recited, or the reason of the thing.</p>
<p>The words of Grotius are pointed and express to shew, not that the treaty shall be reputed broken until a remission is actually pronounced by the injured party, but that it shall not be reputed as broken, until the injured party shall think proper actually to pronounce it broken; and it is remarkable that his <span class="star-pagination">*259</span> words to this effect, are calculated for the very purpose of removing any doubts which other more general expressions might occasion. His words are:</p>
<p>"When there is treachery on one side, it is certainly at the "choice of the innocent party to let the peace subsist; as Scipio "did formerly after many persidious actions of the Cartbagenians. "Because no man, by doing contrary to his obligation, "can thereby discharge himself from it. For though "it is expressed, that by such a fact the peace shall be reputed "as broken, yet this clause is to be understood only in favour of "the innocent, if he thinks fit to make use of it." Grotius. b. 3. c. 20. s. 38.</p>
<p>The whole clause of Vattel is substantially to the same purpose; and, therefore, where in one part of the clause he says, "the offended party may remit the infraction committed," this must be understood, to make the whole consistent, a remission not arising from an express declaration, but from a tacit acquiescence in the breach. Otherwise, what becomes of the words? Â— "but if he chuses not to come to a rupture, the "treaty remains valid and obligatory." The treaty, therefore, must remain valid and obligatory, until the power, authorised to come to a rupture, does come to it.</p>
<p>The same observations apply to Burlamaqui, who expresses himself more generally, but states substantially the same doctrine. His expression is, "it is at the choice of the innocent "party to let the peace subsist," which certainly does not require a positive declaration that it shall subsist.</p>
<p>This doctrine appears to me to be grounded on the highest reason. It is undoubtedly true, that each nation is considered as a moral person, and the welfare and interest of all the individuals of that nation, so far as they may be affected by its concerns with foreign nations, are in each country entrusted to some particular power authorised to negociate with them, or to speak the sense of the nation on any emergency.</p>
<p>When any individual, therefore, of any nation, has cause of complaint against another nation, or any individual of it, not immediately amenable to the authority of his own, he may complain to that power in his own nation, which is entrusted with the sovereignty of it as to foreign negociations, and he will be entitled to all the redress which the nature of his case requires, and the situation of his own country will enable him to obtain.</p>
<p>The people of the United States, in their present Constitution, have devolved on the President and Senate, the power of making treaties; and upon Congress, the power of declaring war.</p>
<p>To one or other of these powers, in case of an infraction of a treaty that has been entered into with the United States, I apprehend application is to be made.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*260</span> Upon such an application various important considerations would necessarily occur.</p>
<p>1. Whether the treaty was first violated on the part of the United States, or on that of the other contracting power?</p>
<p>2. Whether, if first violated by the latter, it was a violation in an important or an inconsiderable article; whether the violation was by design or accident, or owing to unforeseen obstacles; whether, in short, it was wholly or partially without excuse?</p>
<p>3. Whether, admitting it was either, it was a matter for which compensation could be made, or otherwise?</p>
<p>4. Whether the injury was of such a nature as to admit of negociation, or to require immediate satisfaction, peremptorily and without delay?</p>
<p>5. Whether, if the circumstances in all other cases justified it, it was adviseable, upon an extensive view and wife estimation of all the relative circumstances of the United States, to declare the treaty broken, and of course void: for though the party first breaking the treaty cannot make it absolutely void, but it is only voidable at the election of the injured party, yet when that election is made, by declaring the treaty void, I conceive it is totally so as to both parties, and that all rights enjoyed under the treaty are absolutely annulled, as if no stipulation had been made for them?</p>
<p>These are considerations of policy, considerations of extreme magnitude, and certainly entirely incompetent to the examination and decision of a Court of Justice.</p>
<p>Miserable and disgraceful indeed, would be the situation of the citizens of the United States, if they were obliged to comply with a treaty on their part, and had no means of redress for a non-compliance by the other contracting power.</p>
<p>But they have, and the law of nations points out the remedy. The remedy depends on the discretion and sense of duty of their own government.</p>
<p>This plea is therefore defective, so far as concerns the breach of the treaty, not because this court hath no cognizance of a breach of treaty, but because by the law of nations, we have no authority upon any information or concessions of any individuals, to consider or declare it broken; but our judgment must be grounded on the solemn declaration of Congress alone, (to whom, I conceive, the authority is entrusted) given for the very purpose of vacating the treaty on the principles I have stated. The paper transmitted by order of Congress, to the Executive of Virginia, on the subject of a violation complained of on the part of the British, certainly cannot amount to so much, especially as there is another paper of theirs in the year 1787, transmitted to the different States, complaining of violations <span class="star-pagination">*261</span> on our part. They have pronounced no solemn decision, which committed the first infraction; much less have they declared that in consequence of the infraction on the part of the British, they chose that the treaty should be annulled</p>
<p>But it is said that a declaration by Congress, that the treaty was broken by Great Britain, would be exercising a judicial power, which by the Constitution in all cases of treaties is devolved on the Judges.</p>
<p>Surely such a thing was never in the contemplation of the Constitution. If it was, a method is still wanting by which it could be executed; for, if we are to declare, whether Great Britain or the United States, have violated a treaty, we ought to have some way of bringing both the parties before us.</p>
<p>The method contended for by the defendant's counsel is very ill suited to another part of their doctrine, which is certainly right, that a nation is a moral person, and that the act of a sovereign power to whom its foreign concerns are entrusted, is the act of every individual of that nation, because he represents the whole.</p>
<p>But in this case, the King of Great Britain does not act on behalf of the plaintiff, his subject, and the United States on behalf of the defendants, their citizens; but the plaintiff is alledged to represent the sovereignty of the United States, a dignity for aught I know, of which they may be respectively worthy, but which certainly does not either politically or judicially belong to them.</p>
<p>The Judiciary is undoubtedly to determine in all cases in law and equity, coming before them concerning treaties.</p>
<p>The subject of treaties, Gentlemen truly say, is to be determined by the law of nations.</p>
<p>It is a part of the law of nations, that if a treaty be violated by one party, it is at the option of the other party, if innocent, to declare, in consequence of the breach, that the treaty is void.</p>
<p>If Congress, therefore, (who, I conceive, alone have such authority under our Government) shall make such a declaration, in any case like the present, I shall deem it my duty to regard the treaty as void, and then to forbear any share in executing it as a Judge.</p>
<p>But the same law of nations tells me, that until that declaration be made, I must regard it (in the language of the law) valid and obligatory.</p>
<p>The admission of the fact, stated in the plea, cannot be taken as an admission that the fact is strictly true, because the plaintiff had no way of avoiding the plea but by a demurrer, whether it was true or not. If it was well pleaded, it is an admission of the entire truth, but not otherwise. For the reasons I have given, it is clear to me that it is not well pleaded.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*262</span> 2. In regard to the second branch of this plea, new acts of hostility, if meant as constituting a breach, (which I don't understand it to be) the observations I have already made will equally apply to this part of the plea. If meant as a proof, that a war in fact, tho' not in name subsists, and therefore that the plaintiff is an alien enemy, the same observations will apply still more forcibly. We must receive a declaration, that we are in a state of war, from that part of the sovereignty of the union to which that important subject is entrusted. We certainly want some better information of the fact than we have at present. Â— However, this point seems so clear, that the defendant's counsel very saintly attempted to maintain this idea of the case.</p>
<p>I conclude, therefore, for these reasons, that there is nothing in the 4th plea which is a bar to the plaintiff's action.</p>
<p>The great difficulty of the case arises from the second plea. Â— This is the only part of the case, about which I have, from the beginning, entertained any doubt. And I must confess, I have had very great doubts, indeed, on this subject. My opinion has varied more than once in regard to it. I have endeavoured to come to a conclusion by analysing it in all its parts; and the result of my investigation has been, according to the best judgment I am capable of forming, upon the most deliberate examination, that the plea is supportable. My reasons for this opinion, I must give at considerable length, in order to shew it is not a rash one, and that Gentlemen may be enabled in the future progress of this case, more easily to detect my errors, if I should have committed any.</p>
<p>I will divide the consideration of the plea into two points:</p>
<p>1. Whether the plea would have been a bar, if this case had stood independently of the treaty?</p>
<p>2. Whether the treaty destroys the operation of the plea?</p>
<p>In considering the first point, I shall, for the greater perspicuity, consider it under the following heads:</p>
<p>1. Whether the Legislature of this State had a right, agreable to the law of nations, to confiscate the debt in question?</p>
<p>2. Whether, admitting that the Legislature had not a right, agreably to the law of nations, to confiscate the debt, yet if they in fact did so, it would not, while it remained unrepealed by any subsequent, sufficient authority, have been valid and obligatory within the limits of the State, so as to bar any suit for the recovery of the debt?</p>
<p>3. Whether, if it shall be considered that the Legislature did not wholly confiscate the debt, so as totally to extinguish all right in the creditor, (as I apprehend they clearly did not) but only sequester it under the peculiar circumstances stated in the act, the payment in question, under the authority of the act, did not, at that time at least, wholly exonerate the debtor?</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*263</span> 1. It being clear that there was no absolute confiscation in this case, I shall not give a conclusive opinion upon the right; but as I think it highly probable such a right did exist, some observations on that subject will naturally and properly lead to those upon which my opinion, as to the validity of the payments, is ultimately founded. For this reason, and this reason only, I discuss the present question.</p>
<p>Whatever doubt might have been entertained, by reasoning on the particular examples of Grotius and Puffendorf, Bynkershock, (who, I believe, is alone, a very great authority) is full and decisive in the very point as to a general right of confiscating debts of an enemy. His doctrine I take to be this, that the law of nations authorises it, unless in former treaties between the belligerent powers, there be particular stipulations to the contrary. Vattel recognises the general right, but states a prevailing custom in Europe to the contrary; in consequence of which he says, "As this custom has been generally observed, "he who would act contrary to it would injure the public faith; "for strangers trusted his subjects only from a firm persuasion "that the general custom would be observed." Vattel mentions the fact, but does not state the origin of the fact; which, I think, it is not improbable, may have arisen in consequence of particular stipulations, as mentioned by Bynkershock; very few of the civilized nations of Europe, not having treaties with each other.</p>
<p>Whether this customary law (admitting the principle to prevail by custom only) was binding on the American States, during the late war, in respect to Great Britain at least, may be a question of considerable doubt. There were particular circumstances in the relative situation of the two countries, which might possibly exempt this from the force of such a custom, could it be supposed that when this country became an independent nation, this customary law immediately attached upon it. However this country might have been considered bound to observe such a law in regard to any nation recognizing its independence, had we been unfortunately at war with such, and who observed it on her part, (for, undoubtedly, a breach on one side would justify a non-observance by the other) it did not necessarily follow, that the people of this country were bound to observe it to a nation, which not only did not recognize, but sought to destroy their very existence as an independent people, considering them in no other light than as traitors, whose lives and fortunes were forfeited to the law. The people of this country literally sought pro aris &amp; focis; and, therefore, means of defence, which, when inferior objects were in view, might not be strictly justifiable, might in such an extremity become so, on the great principle, on which the laws of war are <span class="star-pagination">*264</span> founded, self preservation; an object that may be attained by any means, not inconsistent with the eternal and immutable rules of moral obligation.</p>
<p>The principles of the common law of England, as appears from a case I shewed to the bar, (that in Sir Thomas Parker's Reports, p. 267. the Attorney General against Weeden and Shales) do undoubtedly recognize the forfeiture of a chose in action due to an enemy. At the utmost it only requires, that an inquisition should be completed during the war, so as, by ascertaining the fact, fully to establish the title of the crown. I can see no reason why that principle of the common law should not obtain here. If so, then independent of any act of legislation whatever, an inquisition completed during the war, finding the fact, would have vested the title to the debt in question absolutely in the State, unless this debt can be distinguished from any other chose in action. Such a distinction has been attempted: 1st, Because this debt was due before the war. 2d, Because the State had not possession of the bond. To these objections, I think, easy answers may be given. 1st, The right acquired by war, (detached from custom, which I am not now considering, or any express stipulation, if there be such) depends on the power of seizing the enemy's effects. It is not grounded on any antecedent claim of property, but on the contrary, the property is admitted to be the enemy's, in the very act of seizing it. Its sole justification is, that being forced into a state of hostility, by an injury for which no satisfaction could be obtained in a peaceable manner, reprisals may be made use of, as a means to compel justice to be done, or to enable the injured party to obtain satisfaction for itself. Such a power, from its nature (being grounded on necessity only) seems incapable of limitation by any general rule, and if conscientiously used (of which each nation must judge for itself) the principle applies as well to property, which was in the country before the war began, as to any other which may by accident come into its possession. The same objection would apply to the seizure of any other property of an enemy, which had been in the country before the war began, as of an incorporeal right. The first resolution in the case I cited is, as to choses in action generally, tho' the chose in action there in question, was, in fact, one which had accrued during the war. 2d, The objection from the State not having possession of the bond, (though countenanced by one or two writers) I think, is also, susceptible of a satisfactory answer. The bond does not create the debt, but is only evidence of it. Possession of it alone can give no right. A robber, or an individual coming to the possession of it by accident, acquires no more title to the money than he had before. The law is so even as to promissory notes payable to bearer, if the fact can be <span class="star-pagination">*265</span> made to appear. If a bond be lost, equity has long since afforded a remedy. In a modern case in a court of law, a profert of a deed has been dispensed with, upon a special declaration stating the loss of it<sup>[*]</sup>. It was while the possession and the right were confounded, that this objection was thought of weight. It is observable also, that it would create an idle and a trifling distinction between debts due by specialty, and simple contract debts, a distinction that might be supported by ingenuity, but certainly not by reason. And it would sound harsh, to say that simple contract debts should be forfeitable, if the witnesses were in the country, but otherwise not. Now, if the forfeiture of the debt in question, could have been effected at common law, by an inquisition completed during the war, I can see no reason why the Legislature could not, with equal propriety as to the right, have effected the same object substantially in any other mode. The proceeding, in each case, must be ex parte, and the object affected can be conclusively bound by neither, if his case did not come within the principles of the law. This I argue, upon a supposition that the customary law of nations, was not binding here, at least in this instance. That, however, is a point of some delicacy, and not necessary for me now to determine, because, 2d, I am of opinion, that admitting that the Legislature had not strictly a right, agreeably to the law of nations, to confiscate the debt in question; yet, if they in fact did so, it would, while it remained unimpeached by any subsequent sufficient authority, have been valid and obligatory within the limits of the State, so as to bar any suit for the recovery of the debt.</p>
<p>In this opinion I have the misfortune to differ from a very high authority<sup>[*]</sup>, for which I have the greatest respect. But however painful it may be, to differ from gentlemen, whose superior abilities and learning I readily acknowledge, I am under the indispensable necessity of judging according to the best lights of my own understanding, assisted by all the information I can acquire. I confess, therefore, that I agree entirely with the Defendant's counsel in thinking, that the acts of the Legislature of the State, in regard to the subject in question, so far as they were conformable to the Constitution of the State, and not in violation of any article of the consederation (where that was concerned) were absolutely binding de facto, and that if, in respect to foreign nations, or any individual belonging to them, they were not strictly warranted by the law of nations, which ought <span class="star-pagination">*266</span> to have been their guide, the acts were not for that reason void, but the State was answerable to the United States, for a violation of the law of nations, which the nation injured might complain of to the sovereignty of the Union. There is no doubt that an act of Parliament in Great Britain, would bind in its own country in every possible case in which the Legislature thought proper to act. Blackstone<sup>[*]</sup> is precise as to that point, even in cases manifestly unjust, if the words of the law are plain and unequivocal. In this contry, thank God, a less arbitrary principle prevails. The power of the Legislatures is limited; of the State Legislatures by their own State Constitutions, and that of the United States; of the Legislature of the Union by the Constitution of the Union. Beyond these limitations, I have no doubt, their acts are void, because they are not warranted by the authority given. But within them, I think, they are in all cases obligatory in the country subject to their own immediate jurisdiction, because in such cases the Legislatures only exercise a discretion expressly confided to them by the constitution of their country, and for the abuse of which, (if it should be abused) they alone are accountable. It is a discretion no more controulable (as I conceive) by a Court of Justice, than a judicial determination is by them, neither department having any right to encroach on the exclusive province of the other, in order to rectify any error in principle, which it may suppose the other has committed. It is sufficient for each to take care that it commits no error of its own. As to a distinction between a State Court and this Court, in this respect, I do, for my part, disclaim, according to my present sentiments, any authority to give a different decision in any case whatsoever from such as a State Court would be competent to give under the same circumstances. I have no conception that this court is in the nature of a foreign jurisdiction. The thing itself would be as improper as it would be odious, in cases where acts of the State have a concurrent jurisdiction with it.</p>
<p>With regard to the exception I speak of, no one has suggested, that the act of October, 1777, was in any manner inconsistent with the Constitution of the state; and at that time the articles of Confederation were not in force; but if they had been, I think there is no colour for alledging any inconsistency with them, since Congress could have passed no act on this subject, but if they had wished for an act, must have recommended to the State Legislatures to pass it. And the very nature of a recommendation implies, that the party recommending cannot, but the party to whom the recommendation is made, can do the thing recommended.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*267</span> The 3d question under the present head, that I proposed, "was this: "Whether, if it shall be considered that the Legislature "did not absolutely confiscate the debt, so as totally to "extinguish all right in the creditor, (as I apprehend they clearly "did not) but only sequestered it under the peculiarcircumstances "stated in the act; the payment in question, under the "authority of the act, did not, at that time at least, wholly exonerate "the debtor."</p>
<p>The words of the enacting clause concerning this subject, are as follow: "That it shall and may be lawful for any citizen "of this commonwealth, owing money to a subject of "Great Britain, to pay the same, or any part thereof, from "time to time, as he shall think fit, into the said loan office, "taking thereout a certificate for the said sum, in the name of the "creditor, with an indorsement under the hand of the commissioner "of the said office, expressing the name of the payer, "and shall deliver such certificate to the Governor and Council, "whose receipt shall discharge him from so much of the debt. "And the Governor and Council shall in like manner lay before "the General Assembly once in every year, an account of "these certificates, specifying the names of the persons, by "and for whom they were paid, and shall fee to the safe-keeping "of the same, subject to the future direction of the "Legislature."</p>
<p>We are too apt, in estimating a law passed at a remote period, to combine in our consideration, all the subsequent events which have had an influence upon it, instead of confining ourselves (which we ought to do) to the existing circumstances at the time of its passing. Let us, however, recollect, that at this period no British creditor could institute a suit for the recovery of his debt, as the war constituted him an alien enemy, and therefore his remedy stood suspended at common law, so that he ran the risque of the entire loss of every debt, where his debtor proved insolvent during the war. Consequently, it would, in his own estimation, have been doing him a considerable service, that the state should authorise a receipt on his behalf, had there been no other currency in circulation than gold or silver. It would have been placing him in a state of security, greater than he had any reason to expect. The extremity of the public situation, rendered paper money unavoidable, but this was an evil to which all American as well as British creditors were liable, and the former (as we all know) were compelled, upon a tender, under pain of being deemed enemies of their country, to receive it at its nominal value. It was natural (and perhaps) not altogether, if at all, unjust, if a man had Â£.100 due to him from B. and he himself owed C. Â£.100, and B. paid him the Â£.100, though in depreciated <span class="star-pagination">*268</span> money, that he should immediately carry it to his creditor. Many, I have no doubt, paid their creditors upon these plain grounds of retribution, though others undoubtedly (for no government can make all men honest) took most scandalous advantages of depreciation in its advanced periods. When this law was passed, the depreciation, I believe, was little felt, and not at all acknowledged. De minimis non curat lex, is an old law maxim. I may parody it on this occasion, by saying De minimis non curat libertas. When life, liberty, property, every thing dear to man was at stake, few could have coldness of heart enough to watch the then scarcely perceptible gradation in the value of money. In this situation the Legislature of the state passed the law in question. It did all that the then situation of affairs would admit of, even for the benefit of the British creditors themselves, and it put it in the power of American creditors, who were compelled to receive the existing currency, to pay their own debts with it. The depositing of money in the loan office, was at that time by many, even in America itself, thought an eligible method of securing it, and with some foreigners, it was a favorite object of speculation. I know, myself, that the proceeds of some very valuable cargoes were ordered to be so applied, and probably there were such instances of which I knew nothing. The increased difficulties of the American war, in a great degree, disappointed the intentions of the original law, but still, British and American creditors were placed on the same footing, so far as it was in the power of the Legislature to effect it.</p>
<p>I thought it proper to say thus much, as introductory to the observations I shall make on the legal operation of those payments.</p>
<p>1. If the state de jure, according to the law of nations (which I strongly incline to think) had a right wholly to confiscate this debt, they had undoubtedly a right to proceed a partial way towards it by receiving the money, and discharging the debtor, substituting itself in his place. We are to be governed by things, and not names, and, consequently, if the state had a right to say to a debtor Â— "We confiscate the right of "your creditor, and you must pay your debt to us, and not to "him," Â— they had a right to say Â— "We do not chuse for the "present, absolutely to confiscate this debt, although we have "the power so to do, but if you will pay the money to us, you "shall be as completely discharged as if we did." In this point of view, I think there can be no doubt but that a discharge would, under such circumstances, have as completely extinguished the right of the creditor as to the debtor, as if, in case no war had intervened, and therefore no right had accrued under it to the states, the debtor had actually paid the money <span class="star-pagination">*269</span> to the order of the creditor, and received a discharge from himself.</p>
<p>2. For the reasons I have before given, I think a confiscation, either whole or partial, or any less exercise of that power de facto, though not de jure, would in this state have been perfectly binding, and in legal contemplation as effectual to bar a recovery, as if the law of nations had been strictly and unquestionably pursued.</p>
<p>3. I believe there can be no doubt, but that according to the law of nations, even on the most modern notions of it, a sequestration merely for the purpose of recovering the debts, and preventing the remittance of them to the enemy, and thereby strengthening him, and weakening the government, would be allowable, and if so, surely it follows, as a matter of course, (perhaps it would follow without a solemn declaration) that when, in virtue of any such act, the money was paid to the government, the debtor was wholly discharged, and the government, if it thought proper, not to proceed to confiscation afterwards, became itself liable.</p>
<p>The case cited from the Law of Evidence,<sup>[*]</sup> I think is an authority substantially in point, to shew the complete discharge of the debtor.</p>
<p>"In debt upon a lease, the Defendant pleaded payment, and "in evidence shewed, he paid it to sequestrators of the commonwealth, "the Plaintiff being a delinquent; and it was "ruled this was good payment to prove the issue, which was a "payment to the Plaintiff himself." Clayton, 129. Anonymous Law of Evidence, (Edit of 1744) p. 196. c. 9. c. 11.</p>
<p>This case is certainly very strong, for it was not deemed necessary to plead it in bar, but it was admitted in evidence, upon a plea that he paid the money to the Plaintiff himself. It does not appear whether this action was tried under the commonwealth, or after the restoration. If under the former, it is more parallel to the present action. If it was tried after the restoration, it is a still stronger case, for it shewed that courts of justice thought themselves bound to protect individuals, who acted under laws of a government they deemed an usurpation, and on all occasions treated with contempt.<sup>[Â†]</sup> Besides an objection, which I shall notice presently, I can imagine but one real difference between that case and the one before us; and that is, that in England the payment was compelled, here <span class="star-pagination">*270</span> it was voluntary. I once thought that circumstance of weight, but on reflection, I consider the public faith equally pledged in one case as in the other; that the authority exercised in both is the same, and that it not only would be unjust in itself, but of dangerous example, to tell men that they should be protected under a compulsory obedience to government, but not upon a chearful submission to it.</p>
<p>4. My observations as to the paper money, which the necessities of this country unfortunately constrained us to use so long, had no other tendency than to shew the circumstances of the fact as they really existed. As a judge, I conceive myself bound to say, that that makes no difference as to the right. The competency of such acts at that time was unquestionable. Their justice depended on the degree of necessity which gave rise to them. A payment in paper money, then a legal tender, I must consider as complete and effectual a payment, at that time, as payment in gold or silver. Such was the law of the country! A law which severe necessity dictated! and by which, in the course of the war, in which many sacrifices became unavoidable, many thousand American citizens, as well as many British merchants, suffered. It is the lot of our nature to experience many evils for which we can find no remedy, and therefore nothing can be more fallacious than in any thing of a general nature, to expect perfect exactness.</p>
<p>For these reasons, I am clearly of opinion, that under the act of sequestration, and the payment and discharge, the discharge will be a complete bar in the present case, unless there be something in the Treaty of Peace to revive the right of the creditor against the defendant, so as to disable the latter from availing himself of the payment into the treasury, in bar to the present action.</p>
<p>The operation of that Treaty comes, therefore, now to be considered. None can reverence the obligation of treaties more than I do. The peace of mankind, the honour of the human race, the welfare, perhaps the being of future generations, must in no inconsiderable degree depend on the sacred observance of national conventions. If ever any people on account of the importance of a treaty, were under additional obligations to observe it, the people of the United States surely are to observe the Treaty in question. It gave peace to our country, after a war attended with many calamities, and, in some of its periods, presenting a most melancholy prospect. It insured, so far as peace could insure them, the freest forms of government, and the greatest share of individual liberty, of which, perhaps, the world had seen any example. It presented boundless views of future happiness and greatness, which almost overpower the imagination, and which, I trust, will not be altogether <span class="star-pagination">*271</span> unrealized: The means are in our power; wisdom and virtue are alone required to avail ourselves of them. Such was the peace which was procured by the Treaty now in question Â— a treaty which, when it shall be fully executed in all its parts, on both sides, future generations will look up to with gratitude and admiration, and with no small degree of fervour towards those who had an active share in procuring it.</p>
<p>In proceeding to examine the treaty with these sentiments, it may well be imagined I do it with a reverential and sacred awe, left by any misconstruction of mine, I should weaken any one of its provisions.</p>
<p>The question now is, whether, under this treaty, the payment into the Treasury is a bar to so much of the Plaintiff's claim, as comprehends money to that amount?</p>
<p>I shall examine this question under two divisions:</p>
<p>1st. Whether it would have been a bar, as the law existed, after the ratification of the treaty, and previous to the passing of the present Constitution of the United States, even if the words of the treaty must be construed to comprehend such a case.</p>
<p>2d. Whether, under that Constitution, it can now be considered as a bar.</p>
<p>My opinion, I confess, as to the first question, is, that if the treaty had plainly comprehended such cases, the Plaintiff could not have recovered in a Court of Justice in this State, as the law stood, previous to the ratification of the present Constitution of the United States.</p>
<p>I feel, as I ought to do, great diffidence, when I am under the necessity, in the execution of my duty as a Judge, of differing from the opinions of those entitled from superior talents, and high authority, to my utmost respect. I am compelled to do so in the present instance, but I shall, at the same time, assign my reasons for my opinion, and if, in the future course of this great cause, I can be convinced that in this, or in any other, instance, I have committed an error, I shall most chearfully acknowledge it.</p>
<p>The opinion I have long entertained, and still do entertain, in regard to the operation of the fourth article is, that the stipulation in favour of creditors, so as to enable them to bring suits, and recover the full value of their debts, could not at that time be carried into effect in any other manner, than by a repeal of the statutes of the different States, constituting the impediments to their recovery, and the passing of such other acts as might be necessary to give the recovery entire efficacy, in execution of the treaty.</p>
<p>I consider a treaty, (speaking generally, independent of the particular provisions on the subject, in our present Constitution, <span class="star-pagination">*272</span> the effect of which I shall afterwards observe upon) as a solemn promise by the whole nation, that such and such things shall be done, or that such and such rights shall be enjoyed.</p>
<p>I think the distinction taken by the Plaintiff's counsel as to stipulations in the treaty, executed or executory, will enable me to illustrate my meaning, by considering various stipulations in the treaty in question.</p>
<p>1st. I will consider what may be deemed executed articles.</p>
<p>In this class I would place, Â— the acknowledgement of independence in the first article; Â— the permission to fifth on the Banks in the third; Â— the acknowledgement of the right to navigate the Mississippi in the eighth.</p>
<p>These I call executed, because, from the nature of them, they require no further act to be done,</p>
<p>2d. The executory (so far as they concern our part in the execution) I would place in three classes.</p>
<p>Those which concern either, 1st, the Legislative Authority. Â— 2d, The Executive. Â— 3d, The Judicial.</p>
<p>The fourth article in question, I consider to be a provision, the purpose of which could only be effected by the Legislative authority; because when a nation promises to do a thing, it is to be understood, that this promise is to be carried into execution, in the manner which the Constitution of that nation prescribes.</p>
<p>When, therefore, a treaty stipulates for any thing of a legislative nature, the manner of giving effect to this stipulation is by that power which possesses the Legislative authority, and which consequently is authorized to prescribe laws to the people for their obedience, passing such laws as the public obligation requires. Laws are always seen, and through that medium people know what they have to do. Treaties are not always seen. Some articles (being what are called secret articles) the public never fee. The present Constitution of the United States, affords the first instance of any government, which, by saying, treaties should be the supreme law of the land, made it indispensable that they should be published for the information of all. At the same time I admit, that a treaty, when executed pursuant to full power, is valid and obligatory, in point of moral obligation, on all, as well on the Legislative, Executive, and Judicial Departments, (so far as the authority of either extends, which in regard to the last, must, in this respect, be very limited) as on every individual of the nation, unconnected officially with either; because it is a promise in effect by the whole nation to another nation, and if not in fact complied with, unless there be valid reasons for non-compliance, the public faith is violated.</p>
<p>I have mentioned this great article which concerns the Legislative <span class="star-pagination">*273</span> department: Let me now, by way of further illustration, consider one which concerns the Executive.</p>
<p>It is stipulated in one part of this treaty, "That all prisoners "on both sides shall be set at liberty." I very much doubt, whether the Commander in Chief, without orders from Congress (then possessing the supreme executive authority of the Union) could have been justified in releasing such prisoners as he had then in custody, after the ratification. Certainly no inferior officer, in whose actual care they were, could, without an order directly or indirectly from the Commander in Chief: And yet, I can fee no reason, if a treaty is to be considered as operating de facto, by superior authority, notwithstanding any impediment arising from laws then in being, why the rigour of the treaty, which in that instance is said to be uncontroulable, should not be so in every other. If Legislative authority is superseded, why not Executive? Surely the former is not less sacred than the latter.</p>
<p>In like manner as to the judicial. It is stipulated in the 6th article, "That there shall be no future confiscations made, nor "any prosecutions commenced against any person or persons, "for, or by reason of any part, which he or they may have taken "in the present war: and that no person shall, on that account, "suffer any future loss or damage, either in his person, liberty, "or property; and that those who may be in confinement on "such charges, at the time of the ratification of the treaty in "America, shall be immediately set at liberty, and the prosecutions "so commenced, be discontinued." I apprehend this article, so far as it respected the release of prisoners confined, could only be executed by an order from the Judges of the Court, having judicial authority, in the cases in question, in consequence either of an actual alteration in the law, by the Legislature, in conformity to the treaty, (where that was necessary); or, of a particular pardon by the Executive; and that if a Jailor, merely because the treaty was ratified, and he found this article in it, had set all such prisoners at liberty, he would have been guilty of an escape.</p>
<p>This reasoning, in my opinion, derives considerable weight from the practice in Great Britain.</p>
<p>The King of Great Britain certainly represents the sovereignty of the whole nation, as to foreign negociations, as completely as the Congress of the United States ever represented the sovereignty of the Union, in that particular. His power, as to declaring war and making peace, is as unlimited as the respective authorities for those purposes in the United States. Â— The whole nation of Great Britain speaks as effectually, and as completely through him, as all the people of the United States can now speak through Congress, as to a declaration of <span class="star-pagination">*274</span> war, or through the President and Senate as to making peace; and of course, as they ever did through Congress, under the old articles of confederation, the power certainly not being lessened. The law of nations equally applies to his treaties on behalf of Great Britain, as it can apply to any treaty made on behalf of the United States. Yet, I believe it is an invariable practice in that country, when the King makes any stipulation of a legislative nature, that it is carried into effect by an act of Parliament. The Parliament is considered as bound, upon a principle of moral obligation, to preserve the public faith, pledged by the treaty, by passing such laws as its obligation requires; but until such laws are passed, the system of law, entitled to actual obedience, remains de facto, as before. I doubt not, if my time had admitted of a full search, and I could have had access to the proper books for information, that I could find many instances of this. I will, however, mention one, which I have been able to procure here. It is a transaction of this nature, so late as the commercial treaty between Great Britain and France, in 1786. The information I derive is from the Annual Registers of 1786 and 1787, which I suppose, as to this point, are correct.</p>
<p>One article of the treaty was in these words:</p>
<p>"The wines of France, imported directly from France to "Great Britain, shall, in no case, pay any higher duties than "those which the wines of Portugal now pay."</p>
<p>This treaty was signed at Versailles, the 26th of September, 1786.</p>
<p>On the 24th of January, 1787, the King met his Parliament, and among other things, informed the two houses, "That he "had concluded a treaty of commerce with the French King, "and had ordered a copy of it to be laid before them. He recommended, "as the first object of their deliberations, the necessary "measures for carrying it into effect; and expressed his "trust, that they would find the provisions, contained in it, to "be calculated for the encouragement of industry, and the extension "of lawful commerce in both countries; and by promoting "a beneficial intercourse between their respective inhabitants, "likely to give additional permanency to the blessings "of peace."</p>
<p>On the 15th of February, the House of Commons, being in a committee of the whole house, Mr. Pitt, the principal Minister of the Crown, moved the following resolution:</p>
<p>"That the wines of France be imported into this country "upon as low duties, as the present duties paid on the importation "of Portugal wines."</p>
<p>I have not had time to examine them all, but, I doubt not, it will be found, on inspection, that there was not a single provision <span class="star-pagination">*275</span> in the treaty, inconsistent with former parliamentary regulations, but Parliament acted upon it by a new law, calculated to give it effect.</p>
<p>The following quotation, (which is a literal one) I think, is very much to the purpose:</p>
<p>"On the Monday following, the report of the committee, "upon the commercial treaty, was brought up, and, on the "usual motion being made, that the house do agree to the "same, notice was taken of the omission of the mention of Ireland, "both in the treaty and the Tariff; and, it was asked, "land, both in the treaty and the Tariff; and, it was asked, "whether or no she was understood to be included in it? To "this question Mr. Pitt replied, That Ireland was undoubtedly "entitled to all the benefits of the treaty; but it was entirely "at her own option, whether she would choose to avail herself "of those advantages; for it was only to be done by her passing "such laws as should put the Tariff on the same footing in that "country as it was stipulated should be done in this. Had the "adoption of the treaty by Ireland, been a stipulation necessary "to be performed before it could be finally concluded on in "this country, then this country would have been deprived of "all the benefits resulting from it in the event of Ireland's "refusal."</p>
<p>Now it is observable, that in speaking of this Tariff, in the treaty, the King of Great Britain does not promise, that the Parliament shall pass laws to such an effect; but the language is thus:</p>
<p>"The two high contracting parties have thought proper to "settle the duties on certain goods and merchandises, in order "to fix invariably, the footing on which the trade therein shall "be established between the two nations. In consequence of "which, they have agreed upon the following Tariff, &amp;c." viz.</p>
<p>In another part, the King of Great Britain says,</p>
<p>"His Britannic Majesty reserves the right of countervailing "by additional duties on the undermentioned merchandises, the "internal duties actually imposed upon the manufactures, or "the import duties which are charged on the raw materials; "namely, on all linens or cottons, stained or painted, on beer, "glass-ware, plate-glass, and iron."</p>
<p>Here is no mention of the Parliament, and yet, no man living will say that a bare proclamation of the King, upon the ground of the treaty, would be an authority for the levying of any duties whatever; but it must be done in the constitutional made, by act of parliament, which affords an additional proof, that where any thing of a legislative nature is in contemplation, it is constantly implied and understood, (without express words) that it can alone be effected by the medium of the legislative authority.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*276</span> That this practice I have noticed is not an occasional one, but has been constantly observed, I think is highly probable from this circumstance; that if treaties were considered in that country as ipso facto repealing all laws inconsistent with them, and imposing new ones, they ought to be bound up with the statutes at large, (which they never have been) otherwise the publication would be at least incomplete, if not deceitful.</p>
<p>These examples from Great Britain I consider of very high authority, as they are taken from a kingdom equally bound by the law of nations as we are; possessing a mixed form of government as we do; and, so far as common principles of legislation are concerned, being the very country from which we derive the rudiments of our legal ideas.</p>
<p>But I must admit that there is also a very high authority, and to which we naturally should be more partial, against this construction. It is the authority of the Congress of the United States in the year 1787. It is an authority derived from an unanimous opinion of that truly respectable body, conveyed in a circular letter from Congress to the different States on this very subject. I bow with proper deference to that great authority: But I should be unworthy of the high station I hold, if I did not speak my real sentiments as a judge, uninfluenced by any authority whatsoever. It is certain, that in this particular, Congress were not exercising a judicial power; and, therefore, the opinion is not conclusive on any court of justice. I feel, however some consolation in differing from an opinion for which so much respect must, and ought to be entertained, by reflecting that though this was the unanimous opinion of Congress, it was not the unanimous opinion of the people of the United States. So far from it, that I believe no suit was ever maintained in any court in the United States, merely on the footing of the treaty when an act of the ligieature stood in the way. It was to remove the obstacle arising from such an opinion, that Congress recommended the repeal of all acts inconsistent with the due execution of the treaty. And I must with due submission say, that in my opinion without such a repeal, no British creditor could have maintained a suit in virtue of the treaty, where any legislative impediment existed, until the present constitution of the United States was formed.</p>
<p>2d. The article in the constitution concerning treaties I have always considered, and do now consider, was in consequence of the conflict of opinions I have mentioned on the subject of the treaty in question. It was found in this instance, as in many others, that when thirteen different legislatures were necessary to act in unison on many occasions, it was in vain to expect that they would always agree to act as Congress might think it their duty to require. Requisitions formerly <span class="star-pagination">*277</span> were made binding in point of moral obligation, (so far as the amount of money was concerned, of which Congress was the constitutional judge,) but the right and the power being separated, it was found often impracticable to make them act in conjunction. To obviate this difficulty, which every one knows had been the means of greatly distressing the union, and injuring its public credit, a power was given to the Representatives of the whole union to raise taxes by their own authority for the good of the whole. Similar embarrassments had been found about the treaty. This was binding in moral obligation, but could not be constitutionally carried into effect (at least in the opinion of many,) so far as acts of legislation then in being constituted an impediment, but by a repeal. The extreme inconveniencies felt from such a system dictated the remedy which the constitution has now provided, "that all treaties made "or which shall be made under the authority of the United "States, shall be the supreme law of the land; and that the "judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any thing in "the constitution or laws of any State to the contrary notwithstanding." "Under this Constitution therefore, so far as a treaty constitutionally is binding, upon principles of moral obligation, it is also by the vigour of its own authority to be executed in fact. It would not otherwise be the supreme law in the new sense provided for, and it was so before in a moral sense.</p>
<p>The provision extends to subsisting as well as to future treaties. I consider, therefore, that when this constitution was ratified, the case as to the treaty in question stood upon the same footing, as if every act constituting an impediment to a creditor's recovery had been expressly repealed, and any further act passed, which the public obligation had before required, if a repeal alone would not have been sufficient.</p>
<p>Before I go to the consideration of the words of the treaty itself, I think it material to say a few words as to the operation which an actual repeal would have had.</p>
<p>I believe no one will doubt, that every thing done under the act while in existence, so far as private rights at least were concerned, would have been unaffected by the repeal. If a statute requires a will of lands to be executed in the presence of two witnesses; and a will is actually executed in that manner, and the statute is afterwards repealed, and three witnesses are made necessary, the will executed in the presence of two others, when the former statute was in being, would be undoubtedly good; and if I am not mistaken, a will made according to a law in being has been held good, even though the devisor died after an alteration of it. Of this, however, I am not sure; but the general position, I imagine, will not be questioned.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*278</span> Let us now see the words of the treaty.</p>
<p>They are these:</p>
<p>"It is agreed, that creditors on either side shall meet with "no lawful impediment to the recovery of the full value in "sterling money, of all bona fide debts heretofore contracted."</p>
<p>The meaning of this provision may perhaps be better considered by an analysation of its parts, so far as they concern the question before us.</p>
<p>1. Creditors Â— There can be no creditor without two correlatives, a debtor and a debt.</p>
<p>Prima facie, therefore, if a debtor has been discharged, he is not the person whom any other person can sue as a creditor. This probably may be fairly applied to the present Defendant, who as a debtor was discharged by legal authority.</p>
<p>With regard to the debt, that in the present instance was not extinguished even by the act of the State, because the right of the creditor to the money was not taken away.</p>
<p>The debt, therefore, remains but not from the same debtor. The state may be considered as substituting itself in some measure in the place of the debtor. The full effect of that substitution, I am not now to consider, nor would it be proper for me at present to give an opinion upon it. The question is not, whether the creditor is entitled to his money, or in what manner, but whether he is entitled to recover it against the present Defendant.</p>
<p>2. No lawful impediment.</p>
<p>These words must be construed as relative to the former, for the whole clause must be taken together. Therefore, where there are a creditor and a debtor, there is to be no lawful impediment to the former recovering against the latter.</p>
<p>If the present Defendant be not a debtor to the Plaintiff, how can the treaty operate as against him?</p>
<p>The words "lawful impediment," may admit of two senses.</p>
<p>One Â— "Any lawful impediment whatsoever arising from "any act done to the prejudice of a creditor's right during the "war." I add that restriction "during the war," because the rules of construction as to treaties, must narrow the words as to the object, the war, the affairs of which the Treaty of Peace was intended to operate upon.</p>
<p>Or, "any impediment arising from any law then in being, "or thereafter to be passed, to the prejudice of a creditor's right."</p>
<p>The latter, I think, is not an unnatural construction, and would give the words great operation, and I think is to be preferred to the former, for the following reasons:</p>
<p>1. This would stipulate for what each Legislature of the Union would rightfully and honestly do, relinquish public claims <span class="star-pagination">*279</span> to aebts existing before the war, and which otherwise might have stood upon a precarious footing; for though peace alone would do away a common law disability to sue, yet I apprehend it would not ipso facto remove a disability expressly created by statute, much less extinguish any public right acquired under any act of confiscation.</p>
<p>2. Though Congress possibly might, as the price of peace, have been authorised to give up, even rights fully acquired by private persons during the war, more especially if derived from the laws of war only against the enemy, and in that case the individual might have been entitled to compensation from the public, for whose interests his own rights were sacrificed; yet, nothing but the most rigorous necessity could justify such a sacrifice; such a sacrifice is not to be presumed even to have been intended under the operation of general words, not making such a construction unavoidable. For, it is reasonable to infer, that in such a case special words would have been used to obviate the least colourable doubt.</p>
<p>Thus (for example) if it was stipulated in a treaty of peace between two European powers, "that all ships taken during the war should be restored," I imagine this would not be construed to include ships taken by privateers, and legally condemned during the war, unless it had, in fact, happened that no other ships had been taken, and then I suppose they would be understood as comprehended, and their own nation must have indemnified them.</p>
<p>3. If, according to the practice in Great Britain, in conformity to the law of nations, and upon the principles of a mixed government, in case any impediments had then existed, by acts of Parliament in Great Britain, to the recovery of American debts, such impediments could only have been removed by a repeal, we may presume the British negociator had reason to conclude, that the lawful impediments in this country could only be removed in the same manner; and if so, may we not fairly say, that the impediments in view could be no other than such as the Legislatures in the respective countries could do away by a repeal, or might by subsequent laws enact? If they wanted a further act of legislation, grounded not merely on ordinary legislative authority, but upon power to destroy private rights acquired under legislative faith, long since pledged and relied on, very special words were proper to effect that object, and neither in one country nor the other could it have been effected with the least colour of justice, but by providing at the same time the fullest means of indemnification.</p>
<p>4. This construction derives great weight from the recommendatory letter of Congress I before mentioned, for I will venture to say, had the act they recommended been passed in <span class="star-pagination">*280</span> the State, in the very words they recommended, they would not have had efficacy enough to destroy those payments as a bar. And yet, if Congress thought such a case ought to have been comprehended, I presume they would have recommended a special provision, clearly comprehending such cases, and accompanied with a full indemnity.</p>
<p>I said the words of the treaty would have great operation, without giving them the very rigorous one contended for. And that will more fully appear when we take up the remaining words, viz.</p>
<p>3. "To the recovery of the full value in sterling money of "all bona fide debts heretofore contracted.</p>
<p>The operation (exclusive of these payments) would therefore be this:</p>
<p>1st. All creditors whose debts had not been confiscated, or where the confiscations were not complete, and no payments had been made, would have a right of recovering their debts.</p>
<p>2d. Perhaps all creditors, whether their debts were confiscated or not, or whether confiscations were complete or not, excepting those only from whom the government had received the money, would be entitled to recover, because undoubtedly the respective Legislatures were competent to restore all these.</p>
<p>3d. Another object of no small importance, was to secure the payment of all these debts in sterling money, so that the creditors might not suffer by paper currency, either then in existence, or that might be thereafter emitted.</p>
<p>When these general words, therefore, can comprehend so many cases, all reasonable objects of the article, I cannot think I am compelled as a Judge, and therefore I ought not to do so, to say that the general words of this article, shall extinguish private as well as public rights.</p>
<p>I hold public faith so sacred, when once pledged either to citizens or to foreigners, that a violation of that faith is never to be inferred as even in contemplation, but when it is impossible to give any other reasonable construction to a public act. I do not clearly see that it was intended in the present instance. I cannot therefore bring myself to say, that the present Defendant having once lawfully paid the money, shall pay it over again. If the matter be only doubtful, I think the doubt should incline in favour of an innocent individual, and not against him. I should hope that the present Plaintiff will still receive his money, as his right to the money certainly has not been divested, but I think for all the reasons I have given, he is not entitled to recover it from the present Defendant.</p>
<p>My opinion, therefore, on the whole of this case is, that judgment ought to be given for the Defendant upon the second plea; upon the third, fourth and fifth for the Plaintiff.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*281</span> WILSON, Justice.</p>
<p>I shall be concise in delivering my opinion, as it depends on a few plain principles.</p>
<p>If Virginia had a power to pass the law of October 1777, she must be equally empowered to pass a similar law in any future war; for, the powers of Congress were, in fact, abridged by the articles of consideration; and in relation to the present Constitution, she still retains her sovereignty and independence as a State, except in the instances of express delegation to the Federal Government.</p>
<p>There are two points involved in the discussion of this power of confiscation: The first arising from the rule prescribed by the law of nations; and the second arising from the construction of the treaty of peace.</p>
<p>When the United States declared their independence, they were bound to receive the law of nations, in its modern state of purity and refinement. By every nation, whatever is its form of government, the confiscation of debts has long been considered disreputable: and, we know, that not a single confiscation of that kind stained the code of any of the European powers, who were engaged in the war, which our revolution produced. Nor did any authority for the confiscation of debts proceed from Congress (that body, which clearly possessed the right of confiscation, as an incident of the powers of war and peace) and, therefore, in no instance can the act of confiscation be considered as an act of the nation.</p>
<p>But even if Virginia had the power to confiscate, the treaty annuls the confiscation. The fourth article is well expressed to meet the very case: it is not confined to debts existing at the time of making the treaty; but is extended to debts heretofore contracted. It is impossible by any glossary, or argument, to make the words more perspicuous, more conclusive, than by a bare recital. Independent, therefore, of the Constitution of the United States, (which authoritatively inculcates the obligation of contracts) the treaty is sufficient to remove every impediment founded on the law of Virginia. The State made the law; the State was a party to the making of the treaty: a law does nothing more than express the will of a nation; and a treaty does the same.</p>
<p>Under this general view of the subject, I think the judgment of the Circuit Court ought to be reversed.</p>
<p>CUSHING, Justice.</p>
<p>My state of this case will, agreeably to my view of it, be short, I shall not question the right of a State to confiscate debts. Here is an act of the Assembly of Virginia, passed in 1777, respecting debts; which contemplating to prevent the enemy deriving strength by the receipt of them during the war, provides, that if any British debtor will pay his debt into the Loan Office, obtain a certificate and <span class="star-pagination">*282</span> receipt as directed, he shall be discharged from so much of the debt. But an intent is expressed in the act not to confiscate, unless Great Britain should set the example. This act, it is said, works a discharge and a bar to the payer. If such payment is to be considered as a discharge, or a bar, so long as the act had force, the question occurs; Â— Was there a power, by the treaty, supposing it contained proper words, entirely to remove this law, and this bar, out of the creditor's way?</p>
<p>This power seems not to have been contended against, by the Defendant's council: And, indeed, it cannot be denied; the treaty having been sanctioned, in all its parts, by the Constitution of the United States, as the supreme law of the land.</p>
<p>Then arises the great question, upon the import of the fourth article of the treaty: And to me, the plain and obvious meaning of it, goes to nullify, ab initio, all laws, or the impediments of any law, as far as they might have been designed to impair, or impede, the creditor's right, or remedy, against his original debtor. "Creditors on either fide shall meet with no lawful impediment "to the recovery of the full value in sterling money, of "all bona fide debts heretofore contracted."</p>
<p>The article speaking of creditors, and bona fide debts heretofore contracted, plainly contemplates debts, as originally contracted, and creditors and original debtors; removing out of the way all legal impediments; so that a recovery might be had, as if no such laws had particularly interposed. The words Â— "recovery of the full value in sterling money," if they have force, or meaning, must annihilate all tender laws, making any thing a tender, but sterling money; and the other words, or at least the whole taken together, must, in like manner, remove all other impediments of law, aimed at the recovery of those debts.</p>
<p>What has some force to confirm this construction, is the sense of all Europe, that such debts could not be touched by States, without a breach of public faith: And for that, and other reasons, no doubt, this provision was insisted upon, in full latitude, by the British negotiators. If the sense of the article be, as stated, it obviates, at once, all the ingenious, metaphysical, reasoning and refinement upon the words, debt, discharge, extinguishment, and affords an answer to the decision made in the time of the interregnum Â— that payment to sequestors, was payment to the creditor.</p>
<p>A State may make what rules it pleases; and those rules must necessarily have place within itself.</p>
<p>But here is a treaty, the supreme law, which overrules all State laws upon the subject, to all intents and purposes; and that makes the difference. Diverse objections are made to this construction: That it is an odious one, and as such, ought to <span class="star-pagination">*283</span> be avoided: That treaties regard the existing state of things: That it would carry an imputation upon public faith: That it is founded on the power of eminent domain, which ought not to be exercised, but upon the most urgent occasions: That the negociators themselves did not think they had power to repeal laws of confiscation; because they, by the 5th article, only agreed, that Congress should recommend a repeal to the States.</p>
<p>As to the rule respecting odious constructions; that takes place where the meaning is doubtful, not where it is clear, as I think it is in this case. But it can hardly be considered as an odious thing, to inforce the payment of an honest debt, according to the true intent and meaning of the parties contracting; especially if, as in this case, the State having received the money, is bound in justice and honor, to indemnify the debtor, for what it in fact received. In whatever other lights this act of Assembly may be reviewed, I consider it in one, as containing a strong implied engagement, on the part of the State, to indemnify every one who should pay money under it, pursuant to the invitation it held out.</p>
<p>Having never confiscated the debt, the State must, in the nature and reason of things, consider itself as answerable to the value. And this seems to be the full sense of the legislators upon this subject, in a subsequent act of assembly; but the treaty holds the original debtor answerable to his creditor, as I understand the matter. The State, therefore, must be responsible to the debtor.</p>
<p>These considerations will, in effect, exclude the idea of the power of eminent domain; and if they did not, yet there was sufficient authority to exercise it, and the greatest occasion that perhaps could ever happen. The same considerations will also take away all ground of imputation upon public faith.</p>
<p>Again, the treaty regarded the existing state of things, by removing the laws then existing, which intended to defeat the creditor of his usual remedy at law.</p>
<p>As to the observations upon the recommendatory provision of the 5th article; I do not fee that we can collect the private opinion of the negociators, respecting their powers, by what they did not do: and if we could, this court is not bound by their opinion, unless the reasons on which it was founded, being known, were convincing. It would be hard upon them, to suppose they gave up all, that they might think they strictly had a right to give up. We may allow somewhat to skill, policy and fidelity.</p>
<p>With respect to confiscations of real and personal estates, which had been compleated, the estates sold, and, perhaps, passed through the hands of a number of purchasors, and improvements made upon real estates, by the then possessors; they knew, that to give them up absolutely, must create much confusion in this <span class="star-pagination">*284</span> country. Avoiding that, (whether from an apprehension of want of power does not appear from the instrument) they were lead only to agree, that Congress should recommend a restitution, or composition.</p>
<p>The 4th article, which is particularly and solely employed about debts, makes provision, according to the doctrine then held sacred by all the sovereigns of Europe.</p>
<p>Although our negociators did not gain an exemption for individuals, from bona fide debts, contracted in time of peace, yet they gained much for this country: as rights of fishery, large boundaries, a settled peace, and absolute independence, with their concomitant and consequent advantages: All which, it might not have been prudent for them to risque, by obstinately insisting on such exemption, either in whole or in part, contrary to the humane and meliorated policy of the civilized world, in this particular.</p>
<p>The 5th article, it is conceived, can not affect or alter the construction of the 4th article. For, first, it is against reason, that a special provision made respecting debts by name, should be taken away immediately after, in the next article, by general words, or words of implication, which words too, have, otherwise, ample matter to operate upon. 2d. No implication from the 5th article, can touch the present case, because that speaks only of actual confiscations, and here was no confiscation. If we believe the Virginia legislators, they say, "We do not confiscate " Â— we will not confiscate debts, unless Great Britain "sets the example," which it is not pretended she ever did.</p>
<p>The provision, that "Creditors shall meet with no lawful "impediment," &amp;c. is as absolute, unconditional, and peremptory, as words can well express, and made not to depend on the will and pleasure, or the optional conduct of any body of men whatever.</p>
<p>To effect the object intended, there is no want of proper and strong language; there is no want of power, the treaty being sanctioned as the supreme law, by the constitution of the United States, which nobody pretends to deny to be paramount and controlling to all state laws, and even state constitutions, wheresoever they interfere or disagree.</p>
<p>The treaty, then, as to the point in question, is of equal force with the constitution itself; and certainly, with any law whatsoever. And the words, "shall meet with no lawful impediment," &amp;c. are as strong as the wit of man could devise, to avoid all effects of sequestration, confiscation, or any other obstacle thrown in the way, by any law, particularly pointed against the recovery of such debts.</p>
<p>I am, therefore, of opinion, that the judgment of the Circuit Court ought to be reversed.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*285</span> BY THE COURT. All and singular the premises being seen by the court here and fully understood, and mature deliberation had thereon, because it appears to the court now here, that in the record and process aforesaid, and also in the rendition of the judgment aforesaid, upon the demurrer to the rejoinder of the Defendants in error, to the replication of the second plea, it is manifestly erred, it is considered that the said judgment for those errors and others in the record and process aforesaid, be revoked and annulled, and altogether held for nought, and it is further considered by the court here, that the Plaintiff in error recover against the Defendants, two thousand nine hundred and seventy-six pounds, eleven shillings and six-pence, good British money, commonly called sterling money, his debt aforesaid, and his costs by him about his suit in this behalf expended, and the said Defendants, in mercy, &amp;c. But this judgment is to be discharged by the payment of the sum of 596 dollars, and interest thereon to be computed after the rate of five per cent per annum, from the 7th day of July, 1782, till payment, besides the costs, and by the payment of such damages as shall be awarded to the Plaintiff in error, on a writ of enquiry to be issued by the Circuit Court of Virginia, to ascertain the sum really due to the Plaintiff in error, exclusively of the said sum of 596 dollars, which was found to be due to the Plaintiff in error, upon the trial in the said Circuit Court, on the issue joined upon the Defendant's plea of payment, at a time when the judgment of the said Circuit Court on the said demurrer was unreversed and in full force and vigor, and for the execution of the judgment of the court, the cause aforesaid is remanded to the said Circuit Court of Virginia.</p>

the UNITED STATES.</h1></center>
<center><p><b>Supreme Court of United States.</b></p></center>
<center></center>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*172</span> The cause was argued at this term, by Lee, the Attorney General of the United States, and Hamilton, the late Secretary of the Treasury, in support of the tax; and by Campbell, the Attorney of the Virginia District, and Ingersoll, the Attorney General of Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>THE COURT delivered their opinions seriatim in the following terms.<sup>[*]</sup></p>
<p>CHASE, Justice.</p>
<p>By the case stated, only one question is submitted to the opinion of this court; Â— whether the law of Congress, of the 5th of June, 1794, entitled, "An act to lay duties upon carriages, for the conveyance of persons," is unconstitutional and void?</p>
<p>The principles laid down, to prove the above law void, are these: That a tax on carriages, is a direct tax, and, therefore, by the constitution, must be laid according to the census, directed <span class="star-pagination">*173</span> by the constitution to be taken, to ascertain the number of Representatives from each State: And that the tax in question, on carriages, is not laid by that rule of apportionment, but by the rule of uniformity, prescribed by the constitution, in the case of duties, imposts, and excises; and a tax on carriages, is not within either of those descriptions.</p>
<p>By the 2nd. section of the 1st. article of the Constitution, it is provided, that direct taxes shall be apportioned among the several States, according to their numbers, to be determined by the rule prescribed.</p>
<p>By the 9th section of the same article, it is further provided, That no capitation, or other direct tax, shall be laid, unless in proportion to the census, or enumeration, before directed.</p>
<p>By the 8th section of the same article, it was declared, that Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises; but all duties, imposts, and excises, shall be uniform throughout the United States.</p>
<p>As it was incumbent on the Plaintiff's Council in Error, so they took great pains to prove, that the tax on carriages was a direct tax; but they did not satisfy my mind. I think, at least, it may be doubted; and if I only doubted, I should affirm the judgment of the Circuit Court. The deliberate decision of the National Legislature, (who did not consider a tax on carriages a direct tax, but thought it was within the description of a duty) would determine me, if the case was doubtful, to receive the construction of the Legislature: But I am inclined to think, that a tax on carriages is not a direct tax, within the letter, or meaning, of the Constitution.</p>
<p>The great object of the Constitution was, to give Congress a power to lay taxes, adequate to the exigencies of government; but they were to observe two rules in imposing them, namely, the rule of uniformity, when they laid duties, imposts, or excises; and the rule of apportionment, according to the census, when they laid any direct tax.</p>
<p>If there are any other species of taxes that are not direct, and not included within the words duties, imposts, or excises, they may be laid by the rule of uniformity, or not; as Congress shall think proper and reasonable. If the framers of the Constitution did not contemplate other taxes than direct taxes, and duties, imposts, and excises, there is great inaccuracy in their language. Â— If these four species of taxes were all that were meditated, the general power to lay taxes was unnecessary. If it was intended, that Congress should have authority to lay only one of the four above enumerated, to wit, direct taxes, by the rule of apportionment, and the other three by the rule of uniformity, the expressions would have run thus: "Congress shall have power to lay and collect direct taxes, and duties, imposts, <span class="star-pagination">*174</span> and excises; the first shall be laid according to the census; and the three last shall be uniform throughout the United States." The power, in the 8th section of the 1st article, to lay and collect taxes, included a power to lay direct taxes, (whether capitation, or any other) and also duties, imposts, and excises; and every other species or kind of tax whatsoever, and called by any other name. Duties, imposts, and excises, were enumerated, after the general term taxes, only for the purpose of declaring, that they were to be laid by the rule of uniformity. I consider the Constitution to stand in this manner. A general power is given to Congress, to lay and collect taxes, of every kind or nature, without any restraint, except only on exports; but two rules are prescribed for their government, namely, uniformity and apportionment: Three kinds of taxes, to wit, duties, imposts, and excises by the first rule, and capitation, or other direct taxes, by the second rule.</p>
<p>I believe some taxes may be both direct and indirect at the same time. If so, would Congress be prohibited from laying ing such a tax, because it is partly a direct tax?</p>
<p>The Constitution evidently contemplated no taxes as direct taxes, but only such as Congress could lay in proportion to the census. The rule of apportionment is only to be adopted in such cases where it can reasonably apply; and the subject taxed, must ever determine the application of the rule.</p>
<p>If it is proposed to tax any specific article by the rule of apportionment, and it would evidently create great inequality and injustice, it is unreasonable to say, that the Constitution intended such tax should be laid by that rule.</p>
<p>It appears to me, that a tax on carriages cannot be laid by the rule of apportionment, without very great inequality and injustice. For example: Suppose two States, equal in census, to pay 80,000 dollars each, by a tax an carriages, of 8 dollars on every carriage; and in one State there are 100 carriages, and in the other 1000. The owners of carriages in one State, would pay ten times the tax of owners in the other. A. in one State, would pay for his carriage 8 dollars, but B. in the other state, would pay for his carriage, 80 dollars.</p>
<p>It was argued, that a tax on carriages was a direct tax, and might be laid according to the rule of apportionment, and (as I understood) in this manner: Congress, after determining on the gross sum to be raised was to apportion it, according to the census, and then lay it in one State on carriages, in another on borses, in a third on tobacco, in a fourth on rice; and so on. Â— I admit that this mode might be adopted, to raise a certain sum in each State, according to the census, but it would not be a tax on carriages, but on a number of specific articles; and it seems to me, that it would be liable to the same objection of <span class="star-pagination">*175</span> abuse and oppression, as a selection of any one article in all the States.</p>
<p>I think, an annual tax on carriages for the conveyance of persons, may be considered as within the power granted to Congress to lay duties. The term duty, is the most comprehensive next to the generical term tax; and practically in Great Britain, (whence we take our general ideas of taxes, duties, imposts, excises, customs, &amp;c.) embraces taxes on stamps, tolls for passage, &amp;c. &amp;c. and is not confined to taxes on importation only.</p>
<p>It seems to me, that a tax on expence is an indirect tax; and I think, an annual tax on a carriage for the conveyance of persons, is of that kind; because a carriage is a consumable commodity; and such annual tax on it, is on the expence of the owner.</p>
<p>I am inclined to think, but of this I do not give a judicial opinion, that the direct taxes contemplated by the Constitution, are only two, to wit, a capitation, or pell tax, simply, without regard to property, profession, or any other circumstances; and a tax on LAND. Â— I doubt whether a tax, by a general assessment of personal property, within the United States, is included within the term direct tax.</p>
<p>As I do not think the tax on carriages is a direct tax, it is unnecessary, at this time, for me to determine, whether this court, constitutionally possesses the power to declare an act of Congress void, on the ground of its being made contrary to, and in violation of, the Constitution; but if the court have such power, I am free to declare, that I will never exercise it, but in a very clear case.</p>
<p>I am for affirming the judgment of the Circuit Court.</p>
<p>PATERSON, Justice.</p>
<p>By the second section of the first article of the Constitution of the United States, it is ordained, that representatives and direct taxes shall be apportioned among the states, according to their respective numbers, which shall be determined by adding to the whole number of free persons, including those bound to service for a term of years, and including Indians not taxed, three fifths of all other persons.</p>
<p>The eighth section of the said article, declares, that Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises; but all duties, imposts and excises, shall be uniform throughout the United States.</p>
<p>The ninth section of the same article provides, that no capitation or other direct tax shall be laid, unless in proportion to the census or enumeration before directed to be taken.</p>
<p>Congress passed a law on the 5th of June, 1794, entitled, "An "act laying duties upon carriages for the conveyance of persons."</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*176</span> Daniel Lawrence Hilton, on the 5th of June, 1794, and therefrom to the last day of September next following, owned, possessed, and kept one hundred and twenty-five chariots for the conveyance of persons, but exclusively for his own separate use, and not to let out to hire, or for the conveyance of persons for hire.</p>
<p>The question is, whether a tax upon carriages be a direct tax? If it be a direct tax, it is unconstitutional, because it has been laid pursuant to the rule of uniformity, and not to the rule of apportionment. In behalf of the Plaintiff in error, it has been urged, that a tax on carriages does not come within the description of a duty, impost, or excise, and therefore is a direct tax. It has, on the other hand, been contended, that as a tax on carriages is not a direct tax; it must fall within one of the classifications just enumerated, and particularly must be a duty or excise. The argument on both sides turns in a circle; it is not a duty, impost, or excise, and therefore must be a direct tax; it is not tax, and therefore must be a duty or excise. What is the natural and common, or technical and appropriate, meaning of the words, duty and excise, it is not easy to ascertain. They present no clear and precise idea to the mind. Different persons will annex different significations to the terms. It was, however, obviously the intention of the framers of the Constitution, that Congress should possess full power over every species of taxable property, except exports. The term taxes, is generical, and was made use of to vest in Congress plenary authority in all cases of taxation. The general division of taxes is into direct and indirect. Although the latter term is not to be found in the Constitution, yet the former necessarily implies it. Indirect stands opposed to direct. There may, perhaps, be an indirect tax on a particular article, that cannot be comprehended within the description of duties, or imposts, or excises; in such case it will be comprised under the general denomination of taxes. For the term tax is the genus, and includes,</p>
<p>1. Direct taxes.</p>
<p>2. Duties, imposts, and excises.</p>
<p>3. All other classes of an indirect kind, and not within any of the classifications enumerated under the preceding heads.</p>
<p>The question occurs, how is such tax to be laid, uniformly or apportionately? The rule of uniformity will apply, because it is an indirect tax, and direct taxes only are to be apportioned. What are direct taxes within the meaning of the Constitution? The Constitution declares, that a capitation tax is a direct tax; and, both in theory and practice, a tax on land is deemed to be a direct tax. In this way, the terms direct taxes, and capitation and other direct tax, are satisfied. It is not necessary <span class="star-pagination">*177</span> to determine, whether a tax on the product of land be a direct or indirect tax. Perhaps, the immediate product of land, in its original and crude state, ought to be considered as the land itself; it makes part of it; or else the provision made against taxing exports would be easily eluded. Land, independently of its produce, is of no value. When the produce is converted into a manufacture, it assumes a new shape; its nature is altered; its original state is changed; it becomes quite another subject, and will be differently considered. Whether direct taxes, in the sense of the Constitution, comprehend any other tax than a capitation tax, and tax on land, is a questionable point. If Congress, for instance, should tax, in the aggregate or mass, things that generally pervade all the states in the Union, then, perhaps, the rule of apportionment would be the most proper, especially if an assessment was to intervene. This appears by the practice of some of the states, to have been considered as a direct tax. Whether it be so under the Constitution of the United States, is a matter of some difficulty; but as it is not before the court, it would be improper to give any decisive opinion upon it. I never entertained a doubt, that the principal, I will not say, the only, objects, that the framers of the Constitution contemplated as falling within the rule of apportionment, were a capitation tax and a tax on land. Local considerations, and the particular circumstances, and relative situation of the states, naturally lead to this view of the subject. The provision was made in favor of the southern States. They possessed a large number of slaves; they had extensive tracts of territory, thinly settled, and not very productive. A majority of the states had but few slaves, and several of them a limited territory, well settled, and in a high state of cultivation. The southern states, if no provision had been introduced in the Constitution, would have been wholly at the mercy of the other states. Congress in such case, might tax slaves, at discretion or arbitrarily, and land in every part of the Union after the same rate or measure: so much a head in the first instance, and so much an acre in the second. To guard them against imposition in these particulars, was the reason of introducing the clause in the Constitution, which directs that representatives and direct taxes shall be apportioned among the states, according to their respective numbers.</p>
<p>On the part of the Plaintiff in error, it has been contended, that the rule of apportionment is to be favored rather than the rule of uniformity; and, of course, that the instrument is to receive such a construction, as will extend the former and restrict the latter. I am not of that opinion. The Constitution has been considered as an accommodating system; it was the <span class="star-pagination">*178</span> effect of mutual sacrifices and concessions; it was the work of compromise. The rule of apportionment is of this nature; it is radically wrong; it cannot be supported by any solid reasoning. Why should slaves, who are a species of property, be represented more than any other property? The rule, therefore, ought not to be extended by construction.</p>
<p>Again, numbers do not afford a just estimate or rule of wealth. It is, indeed, a very uncertain and incompetent sign of opulence. There is another reason against the extension of the principle laid down in the Constitution.</p>
<p>The counsel on the part of the Plaintiff in error, have further urged, that an equal participation of the expense or burden by the several states in the Union, was the primary object, which the framers of the Constitution had in view; and that this object will be effected by the principle of apportionment, which is an operation upon states, and not on individuals; for, each state will be debited for the amount of its quota of the tax, and credited for its payments. This brings it to the old system of requisitions. An equal rule is doubtless the best. But how is this to be applied to states or to individuals? The latter are the objects of taxation, without reference to states, except in the case of direct taxes. The fiscal power is exerted certainly, equally, and effectually on individuals; it cannot be exerted on states. The history of the United Netherlands, and of our own country, will evince the truth of this position. The government of the United States could not go on under the confederation, because Congress were obliged to proceed in the line of requisition. Congress could not, under the old confederation, raise money by taxes, be the public exigencies ever so pressing and great. They had no coercive authority Â— if they had, it must have been exercised against the delinquent states, which would be ineffectual, or terminate in a separation. Requisitions were a dead letter, unless the state legislatures could be brought into action; and when they were, the sums raised were very disproportional. Unequal contributions or payments engendered discontent, and somented state-jealousy. Whenever it shall be thought necessary or expedient to lay a direct tax on land, where the object is one and the same, it is to be apprehended, that it will be a fund not much more productive than that of requisition under the former government. Let us put the case. A given sum is to be raised from the landed property in the United States. It it easy to apportion this sum, or to assign to each state its quota. The Constitution gives the rule. Suppose the proportion of North Carolina to be eighty thousand dollars. This sum is to be laid on the landed property in the state, but by what rule, and by whom? Shall every acre pay <span class="star-pagination">*179</span> the same sum, without regard to its quality, value, situation, or productiveness? This would be manifestly unjust. Do the laws of the different states furnish sufficient data for the purpose of forming one common rule, comprehending the quality, situation, and value of the lands? In some of the states there has been no land tax for several years, and where there has been, the mode of laying the tax is so various, and the diversity in the land is so great, that no common principle can be deduced, and carried into practice. Do the laws of each state furnish data, from whence to extract a rule, whose operation shall be equal and certain in the same state? Even this is doubtful. Besides, sub-divisions will be necessary; the apportionment of the state, and perhaps of a particular part of the state, is again to be apportioned among counties, townships, parishes, or districts. If the lands be classed, then a specific value must be annexed to each class. And there a question arises, how often are classifications and assessments to be made? Annually, triennially, septennially? The oftener they are made, the greater will be the expense; and the feldomer they are made, the greater will be the inequality, and injustice. In the process of the operation a number of persons will be necessary to class, to value, and assess the land; and after all the guards and provisions that can be devised, we must ultimately rely upon the discretion of the officers in the exercise of their functions. Tribunals of appeal must also be instituted to hear and decide upon unjust valuations, or the assessors will act ad libitum without check or control. The work, it is to be feared, will be operose and unproductive, and full of inequality, injustice, and oppression. Let us, however, hope, that a system of land taxation may be so corrected and matured by practice, as to become easy and equal in its operation, and productive and beneficial in its effects. But to return. A tax on carriages, if apportioned, would be oppressive and pernicious. How would it work? In some states there are many carriages, and in others but few. Shall the whole sum fall on one or two individuals in a state, who may happen to own and possess carriages? The thing would be absurd, and inequitable. In answer to this objection, it has been observed, that the sum, and not the tax, is to be apportioned; and that Congress may select in the different states different articles or objects from whence to raise the apportioned sum. The idea is novel. What, shall land be taxed in one state, slaves in another, carriages in a third, and horses in a fourth; or shall several of these be thrown together, in order to levy and make the quotaed sum? The scheme is fanciful. It would not work well, and perhaps is utterly impracticable. It is easy to discern, that great, and perhaps insurmountable, obstacles must arise in forming the subordinate <span class="star-pagination">*180</span> arrangements necessary to carry the system into effect; when formed, the operation would be slow and expensive, unequal and unjust. If a tax upon land, where the object is simple and uniform throughout the states, is scarcely practicable, what shall we say of a tax attempted to be apportioned among, and raised and collected from, a number of dissimilar objects. The difficulty will increase with the number and variety of the things proposed for taxation. We shall be obliged to resort to intricate and endless valuations and assessments, in which every thing will be arbitrary, and nothing certain. There will be no rule to walk by. The rule of uniformity, on the contrary, implies certainty, and leaves nothing to the will and pleasure of the assessor. In such case, the object and the sum coincide, the rule and the thing unite, and of course there can be no imposition. The truth is, that the articles taxed in one state should be taxed in another; in this way the spirit of jealousy is appeased, and tranquillity preserved; in this way the pressure on industry will be equal in the several states, and the relation between the different subjects of taxation duly preserved. Apportionment is an operation on states, and involves valuations and assessments, which are arbitrary, and should not be resorted to but in case of necessity. Uniformity is an instant operation on individuals, without the intervention of assessments, or any regard to states, and is at once easy, certain, and efficacious. All taxes on expences or consumption are indirect taxes. A tax on carriages is of this kind, and of course is not a direct tax. Indirect taxes are circuitous modes of reaching the revenue of individuals, who generally live according to their income. In many cases of this nature the individual may be said to tax himself. I shall close the discourse with reading a passage or two from Smith's Wealth of Nations.</p>
<p>"The impossibility of taxing people in proportion to their "revenue, by any capitation, seems to have given occasion to "the invention of taxes upon consumable commodities; the "state not knowing how to tax directly and proportionably the "revenue of its subjects, endeavours to tax it indirectly by taxing "their expence, which it is supposed in most cases will be "nearly in proportion to their revenue. Their expence is taxed "by taxing the consumable commodities upon which it is "laid out. 3 Vol. page 331.</p>
<p>"Consumable commodities, whether necessaries or luxuries, "may be taxed in two different ways; the consumer may either "pay an annual sum on account of his using or consuming "goods of a certain kind, or the goods may be taxed while "they remain in the hands of the dealer, and before they are "delivered to the consumer. The consumable goods, which <span class="star-pagination">*181</span> "last a considerable time before they are consumed altogether, "are most properly taxed in the one way; those of which the "consumption is immediate, or more speedy, in the other: the "coach tax and plate tax are examples of the former method of "imposing; the greater part of the other duties of excise and "customs of the latter." 3 Vol. page 341.</p>
<p>I am, therefore, of opinion, that the judgment rendered in the Circuit Court of Virginia ought to be affirmed.</p>
<p>IREDELL. Justice.</p>
<p>I agree in opinion with my brothers, who have already expressed theirs, that the tax in question, is agreeable to the Constitution; and the reasons which have satisfied me, can be delivered in a very few words, since I think the Constitution itself affords a clear guide to decide the controversy.</p>
<p>The Congress possess the power of taxing all taxable objects, without limitation, with the particular exception of a duty on exports.</p>
<p>There are two restrictions only on the exercise of this authority:</p>
<p>1. All direct taxes must be apportioned.</p>
<p>2. All duties, imposts, and excises must be uniform.</p>
<p>If the carriage tax be a direct tax, within the meaning of the Constitution, it must be apportioned.</p>
<p>If it be a duty, impost, or excise, within the meaning of the Constitution, it must be uniform.</p>
<p>If it can be considered as a tax, neither direct within the meaning of the Constitution, nor comprehended within the term duty, impost or excise; there is no provision in the Constitution, one way or another, and then it must be left to such an operation of the power, as if the authority to lay taxes had been given generally in all instances, without saying whether they should be apportioned or uniform; and in that case, I should presume, the tax ought to be uniform; because the present Constitution was particularly intended to affect individuals, and not states, except in particular cases specified: And this is the leading distinction between the articles of Consederation and the present Constitution.</p>
<p>As all direct taxes must be apportioned, it is evident that the Constitution contemplated none as direct but such as could be apportioned.</p>
<p>If this cannot be apportioned, it is, therefore, not a direct tax in the sense of the Constitution.</p>
<p>That this tax cannot be apportioned is evident. Suppose 10 dollars contemplated as a tax on each chariot, or post chaise, in the United States, and the number of both in all the United States be computed at 105, the number of Representatives in Congress.</p>
<span class="star-pagination">*182</span>
                                                   Dolls. Cts.
  This would produce in the whole   -     -     -    1050
  The share of Virginia being 19-105 parts, would
      be       -       -       -     Dollars 190
  The share of Connecticut being 7-105 parts,
      would be        -       -       -       70
  Then suppose Virginia had 50 carriages,
  Connecticut    -     -     2.
  The share of Virginia being 190 dollars, this
      must of course be collected from the owners
      of carriages, and there would therefore
      be collected from each carriage  -   -    -       3 80
  The share of Connecticut being 70 dollars, each
      carriage would pay        -        -      -      35
<p>If any state had no carriages, there could be no apportionment at all. This mode is too manifestly absurd to be supported, and has not even been attempted in debate.</p>
<p>But two expedients have been proposed of a very extraordinary nature, to evade the difficulty.</p>
<p>1. To raise the money a tax on carriages would produce, not by laying a tax on each carriage uniformly, but by selecting different articles in different states, so that the amount paid in each state may be equal to the sum due upon a principle of apportionment. One state might pay by a tax on carriages, another by a tax on slaves, &amp;c.</p>
<p>I should have thought this merely an exercise of ingenuity, if it had not been pressed with some carnesiness; and as this was done by gentlemen of high respectability in their profession, it deserves a serious answer, though it is very difficult to give such a one.</p>
<p>1. This is not an apportionment, of a tax on Carriages, but of the money a tax on carriages might be supposed to produce, which is quite a different thing.</p>
<p>2. It admits that Congress cannot lay an uniform tax on all carriages in the Union, in any mode, but that they may on carriages in one or more states. They may therefore lay a tax on carriages in 14 states, but not in the 15th.</p>
<p>3. If Congress, according to this new decree, may select carriages as a proper object, in one or more states, but omit them in others, 1 presume they may omit them in all and select other articles.</p>
                                                   Dolls. Cts.
  Suppose, then, a tax on carriages would produce  100,000
  And a tax on horses a like sum      -       -    100,000
<p>and a hundred thousand dollars were to be apportioned according to that mode. Gentlemen might amuse themselves with calling this a tax on carriages, or a tax on horses, while not a <span class="star-pagination">*183</span> single carriage, nor a single horse, was taxed throughout the Union.</p>
<p>4. Such an arbitrary method of taxing different states differently, is a suggestion altogether new, and would lead, if practised, to such dangerous consequences, that it will require very powerful arguments to shew, that that method of taxing would be in any manner compatible with the Constitution, with which at present I deem it utterly irreconcilable, it being altogether destructive of the notion of a common interest, upon which the very principles of the Constitution are founded, so far as the condition of the United States will admit.</p>
<p>The second expedient proposed, was, that of taxing carriages, among other things, in a general assessment. This amounts to saying, that Congress may lay a tax on carriages, but that they may not do it unless they blend it with other subjects of taxation. For this, no reason or authority has been given, and in addition to other suggestions offered by the Counsel on that side, affords an irrefragable proof, that when positions plainly so untenable, are offered to counteract the principle contended for by the opposite counsel, the principle itself is a right one; for, no one can doubt, that if better reasons could have been offered, they would not have escaped the sagacity and learning of the gentlemen who offered them.</p>
<p>There is no necessity, or propriety, in determining what is or is not, a direct, or indirect, tax in all cases.</p>
<p>Some difficulties may occur which we do not at present foresee. Perhaps a direct tax in the sense of the Constitution, can mean nothing but a tax on something inseparably annexed to the soil: Something capable of apportionment under all such circumstances.</p>
<p>A land or a pull tax may be considered of this description.</p>
<p>The latter is to be considered so particularly, under the present Constitution, on account of the slaves in the southern states, who give a ratio in the representation in the proportion of 3 to 5.</p>
<p>Either of these is capable of apportionment.</p>
<p>In regard to other articles, there may possibly be considerable doubt.</p>
<p>It is sufficient, on the present occasion, for the court to be satisfied, that this is not a direct tax contemplated by the Constitution, in order to affirm the present judgment; since, if it cannot be apportioned, it must necessarily be uniform.</p>
<p>I am clearly of opinion, this is not a direct tax in the sense of the Constitution, and, therefore, that the judgment ought to be affirmed.</p>
<p>WILSON, Justice.</p>
<p>As there were only four Judges, including myself, who attended the argument of this cause, I <span class="star-pagination">*184</span> should have though it proper to join in the decision, though I had before expressed a judicial opinion on the subject, in the Circuit Court of Virginia, did not the unanimity of the other three Judges, relieve me from the necessity. I shall now, however, only add, that my sentiments, in favor of the constitutionality of the tax in question, have not been changed.</p>
<p>CUSHING, Justice.</p>
<p>As I have been prevented, by indisposition, from attending to the argument, it would be improper to give an opinion on the merits of the cause.</p>
<p>BY THE COURT. Let the judgment of the Circuit Court be affirmed.</p>

<p>But, BY THE COURT: Â— In all questions of this nature, we must be governed by a found discretion; in order to prevent, on the one hand, an unnecessary procrastination, and, on the other hand, to avoid an injurious precipitation of trials. In the present instance, we think there is a sufficient foundation laid before us, to justify our granting a continuance 'till the next Term. If the cause were now to be taken up, it must be heard and decided ex parte. It is true, that counsel might even at this time be employed, so as to admit, perhaps, of an argument before the court rises; but it is reasonable, that in a cause of such magnitude,<sup>[*]</sup> the counsel should have an opportunity <span class="star-pagination">*306</span> to investigate the principles, and to consider the authorities connected with it, out of term, and unencumbered by the pressure of the current business of the court.</p>
<p>Let the Cause be continued.</p>
<h2>NOTES</h2>
<p>[*]  The Attorney General stated the point in controversy to arise on these facts: Lord Fairfax was a citizen of Virginia, and died in the year 1780; having made a will by which he devised certain lands in that state, to the Defendant in error, who then was, and ever has been, a British subject, resident in Great Britain. The question is, whether being thus an alien, the Defendant in error can take and hold the lands by devise? And, it will be contended, that his title is completely protected by the Treaty of Peace, concluded between the United States and Great Britain, in the year 1783.
</p>
<p>CHASE, Justice: I recollect, that in Harrison's case, a decision in favor of such a devisee's title was given, by a court in Maryland. It is a matter, however, of great moment; and ought to be deliberately and finally settled.</p>

<p>Suggestions of policy and conveniency cannot be considered in the judicial determination of a question of right: the Treaty with France, whatever that is, must have its effect. By the 19th article, it is declared, that French vessels, whether public and of war, or private and of merchants, may, on any urgent necessity, enter our ports, and be supplied with all things needful for repairs. In the present case, the privateer only underwent a repair; and the mere re-placement of her force cannot be a material augmentation; even if an augmentation of force could be deemed (which we do not decide) a sufficient cause for restitution.</p>

<p class="parties">The United States<br/>v.<br/>La Vengeance</p>
<p class="date">August Term, 1796.</p>
<div class="num" id="p1">
<span class="num">1</span>
<p class="indent">Error from the Circuit Court for the district of New York. It appeared on the return of the record, that La Vengeance, a French privateer, had captured and carried into New York, a Spanish ship, called La Princessa de Asturias; and that thereupon Don Diego Pintardo, the owner of the prize, filed a Libel in the District Court, complaining of the capture; alledging that La Vengeance was illegally fitted out within the United States; and praying restitution and damages: but on a claim, exhibited in behalf of the owners of the privateer, the District Court dismissed the Libel with costs; and, upon appeal to the Circuit Court, that decree was affirmed. The fate of Pintardo's Libel determined, likewise, the fate of an information filed ex officio, by the District Attorney, claiming the privateer as a forfeture, upon the same allegation, that she had been illegally armed and equipped in the United States, in violation of the act of Congress: and in both these decisions the parties acquiesced.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p2">
<span class="num">2</span>
<p class="indent">But a third proceeding had been instituted against the privateer, in which the District Attorney filed, ex officio, an information, stating 'that Aquila Giles, Marshal of the said district, had seized to the use of the United States, as forfeited, a certain schooner, or vessel, called La Vengeance, with her tackle, apparel, and furniture, the property of some person, or persons, to the said Attorney unknown; for that certain cannons, muskets, and gun-powder, to wit, 2 cannon, 20 muskets, and 50 boxes of gun-powder, were between the 22nd of May, 1794, and the 22nd of May, 1795,<a class="footnote" href="#fn-s" id="fn-s_ref">*</a> exported in the said schooner, or vessel, from the said United States, to wit, from Sandy-Hook, in the state of New Jersey (that is to say, from the city of New York in the New York district) to a foreign country, to wit, to Port-de-Paix, in the island of St. Domingo, in the West-Indies, contrary to the prohibitions of the act, in such case made and provided,' etc: And praying judgment of forfeiture accordingly. A claim was filed on behalf of the owners of the privateer, denying the exportation of cannon or muskets; and alledging that the gun-powder constituted part of the equipment of the Semillante, a frigate belonging to the Republic of France, and had been taken from her and put on board the privateer, to be carried to Port-de-Paix, by order of the proper officer of the said Republic. It was, also, alledged, that the schooner, after her arrival at Port-de-Paix, was bona fide sold to one Jaques Rouge, a citizen of the French Republic, in whose behalf the claim was instituted.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p3">
<span class="num">3</span>
<p class="indent">After argument, the District Judge decreed, that the schooner should be forfeited; but, upon appeal to the Circuit Court, the decree was reversed, and Judge Chace certified that the judgment of reversal was founded on the following facts: '1st. That from 18 to 20 muskets, were carried in the said schooner La Vengeance in the month of March or April, 1795, from the United States of America, to a foreign country, to wit, to Port-de-Paix, in the West Indies: But that such muskets were the private property of French passengers on board of the said schooner, carried out for their own use, and not by way of merchandize.' 2nd. 'That upwards of 40 boxes of gun-powder were carried at the same time, from the said United States, in the said schooner to Port-de-Paix, aforesaid: But that such gun-powder was taken from on board the Semilliante frigate, lying in the harbour of New York, was a part of her equipment, did not appear ever to have been landed in the said United States, was carried out for the use of the French Republic, was delivered to the commander in chief at Port-de-Paix - and was not exported by way of trade or merchandize.'</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p4">
<span class="num">4</span>
<p class="indent">From this judgment of the Circuit Court, a writ of error was brought on behalf of the United States, the general errors were assigned, and the Defendant in error pleaded in nullo est erratum. The issue was argued on the 10th of August, by Lee, Attorney General of the United States, for the Plaintiff in error, and by Du Ponceau, for the Defendant:<a class="footnote" href="#fn-s-1" id="fn-s-1_ref">*</a> but no exception was taken, by the former, in reference to the merits of the cause.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Lee, Attorney General:</p>
<div class="num" id="p5">
<span class="num">5</span>
<p class="indent">There are two grounds on which this writ of error is to be supported-1st. That it is a crininal cause; and, therefore, it should never have been removed to the Circuit Court, the judgment of the District Court being final in criminal causes: And 2nd. That even if it could be considered as a civil suit, it is not a suit of Admiralty and Maritime jurisdiction; and, therefore, the Circuit Court should have remanded it to be tried by a jury in the District Court.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p6">
<span class="num">6</span>
<p class="indent">1st. Point. All causes are either civil or criminal; and this is a criminal cause, as well on account of the manner of prosecution, as on account of the matter charged. Thus, Informations are a proceeding at common law, and classed with criminal prosecutions, 4 Bl. Gom. 303; and the act of Congress which was framed to protect the United States, at a critical moment, from a serious injury, inflicts for the offence of violating its provisions, a forfeiture of the vessel employed in exporting arms or ammunition, and a fine of one thousand dollars. It is true, that it may be considered, in part, as a proceeding in rem; but still it is a criminal proceeding. There are but two kinds of information known in England, one in the Exchequer touching matters of Revenue, the other in the King's Bench, touching the punishment of misdemeanors. 3 Bl. Com. 262. Now, the revenue of the United States is not at all concerned in this case; nor would the Court of Exchequer take cognizance of a similar case in England. If, therefore, the United States do not claim La Vengeance for debt, nor as a mere exercise of arbitrary will, but on account of some offence, some crime, that has been committed; it follows, of course, that the process used to enforce the claim, must, under any denomination, be, in fact, a criminal process; and, in all criminal causes, whether the trial is by a jury, or otherwise, the judgment of the District Court is final. Though penal suits have sometimes been construed civil actions; it has only been done where individuals have been concerned, and, in one instance, to admit the testimony of a Quaker, on affirmation; but none of the exceptions to the general rule will reach the present case. 1 Wills 125. 2 Stra. 1227. Cowp. 382.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p7">
<span class="num">7</span>
<p class="indent">2nd. Point. The ninth section of the Judicial act declares, that 'the trials of issues in fact, in the District Courts, in all causes, except civil causes of Admiralty and Maritime jurisdiction, shall be by jury.' If there are criminal causes of Admiralty and Maritime jurisdiction they would not be within the exception, and must be tried by jury. But this criticism is not insisted upon; since the present case cannot, in any sense, be deemed a civil suit of Admiralty and Maritime jurisdiction. The principles regulating Admiralty and Maritime jurisdiction in this country, must be such as were consistent with the common law of England, at the period of the revolution. How, then, would a similar case be considered in England? Blackstone says, 'all admiralty causes must be causes arising wholly upon the sea, and not within the precincts of any county.' 3 Bl. Com. 106. And Coke had previously remarked, 'that altum mare is out of the jurisdiction of the common law, and within the jurisdiction of the Lord Admiral.' Now, the offence here charged is that of exporting arms and ammunition out of the United States to Port-de-Paix. The act itself, indeed, without the intervention of the statute, would, doubtless, have been lawful; but an act of exportation, from the force of the term, must be commenced here; and if done part on land, and part on sea, the authorities decide, that the admiralty cannot claim the jurisdiction. It is not made criminal to receive arms and ammunition at sea, but to export them from the United States, within which the offensive act must, therefore, originate. If, then, this is not a cause of Admiralty and Maritime jurisdiction, though it should be allowed to be a civil cause, still the trial ought to have been by jury. It may be proper to add, that the act of Congress (sect. 4.) expressly adopts in this case, the mode of prosecuting to recover the forfeitures and penalties incurred under the act for more efectually collecting the impost, etc. (passed the 4th of August, 1790, s. 67.) which declares that on filing a claim 'the court shall proceed to hear and determine the cause according to law:' but there is nothing in this provision, that can be construed to exclude a jury trial; any more than in the form of a commission of Oyer and Terminer, which empowers the Judges 'to hear and determine,' and yet they always hear and determine, as to the facts, through the medium of a jury; nor does the mere institution of a new mode of proceeding necessarily rescind and annul, every pre-existing process applicable to the same subject. If, upon the whole, there has been a mis-trial, and a representation should be presented to the proper department, the forfeiture would not be allowed to enrich the Treasury; but as a judicial question, it is more proper that the error should be judicially corrected. The Circuit Court ought to have remanded the cause to the District Court, taken in either of the views it exhibits: if it was a criminal cause, strictly speaking, it ought to have been remanded, because it had not been tried by a jury, and because the judgment of the District Court is, in such case, definitive: if it was a civil suit, but not of Admiralty or Maritime jurisdiction, it ought to have been remanded, because, in such case, the issue had not been tried by jury: And in either case, whether criminal or civil, this court has a superintending and efficient control over the judgments and decrees of the Circuit Court.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p8">
<span class="num">8</span>
<p class="indent">The Chief Justice informed the opposite counsel, that as the court did not feel any reason to change the opinion, which they had formed upon opening the cause, they would dispense with any further argument; and on the 11th of August, he pronounced the following judgment.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p9">
<span class="num">9</span>
<p class="indent">By the Court. We are perfectly satisfied upon the two points that have been agitated in this cause. In the first place, we think, that it is a cause of Admiralty and Maritime Jurisdiction. The exportation of arms and ammunition is, simply, the offence; and exportation is entirely a water transaction. It appears, indeed, on the face of the libel, to have commenced at Sandy Hook; which, certainly, must have been upon the water. In the next place, we are unanimously of opinion, that it is a civil cause: It is a process of the nature of a libel in rem; and does not, in any degree, touch the person of the offender.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p10">
<span class="num">10</span>
<p class="indent">In this view of the subject, it follows, of course, that no jury was necessary, as it was a civil cause; and that the appeal to the Circuit Court was regular, as it was a cause of Admiralty and Maritime jurisdiction. Therefore,</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p11">
<span class="num">11</span>
<p class="indent">Let the decree of the Circuit Court be affirmed with costs.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p12">
<span class="num">12</span>
<p class="indent">But on opening the court the next day, THE CHIEF JUSTICE directed the words 'with costs' to be struck out of the entry, as there appeared to have been some cause for the prosecution. He observed, however, that, in doing this, the Court did not mean to be understood, as, at all, deciding the question, whether, in any case, they could award costs against the United States, but left it entirely open for future discussion.</p>
</div>
<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote" id="fn-s">
<a class="footnote" href="#fn-s_ref">*</a>
<p> The information was founded on the act of congress, passed the 22d May 1794, prohibiting, for one year ennsuing, the exportation of arms and ammunition.</p>
</div>
<div class="footnote" id="fn-s-1">
<a class="footnote" href="#fn-s-1_ref">*</a>
<p> The case having been opened, and some general principles stated by the attorney-general, on a preceding day, the court were led to suppose that he did not mean to enter into any farther discussion, and declared an opinion; but being afterwards informed, that, on account of the importance of the subject, a further argument was expected; they gave this opportunity.</p>

<p>On the third point, that the owners of the privateer are responsible for the conduct of their agents, the officers and crew, <span class="star-pagination">*335</span> to all the world; and that the measure of such responsibility is the full value of the property injured, or destroyed.<sup>[*]</sup></p>
<p>On the fourth point, that whatever might, originally, have been the irregularity in attaching the Industry and her cargo, it is compleatly obviated, since the captors had a power to sell the prize; and by their own agreement, they have consented that the proceeds of the sale should abide the issue of the present suit.</p>
<p>The decree of the Circuit Court affirmed.</p>
<h2>NOTES</h2>
<p>[*]  CHASE, and IREDELL, Justices, agreed that the owners were responsible, but differed as to the extent, observing that the privateer's men were justifiable in abandoning, to save themselves from captivity; but that the revoval of the money into the privateer, and the subsequent scutling of the brig, were unlawful acts.</p>

VIRGINIA.</h1></center>
<center><p><b>Supreme Court of United States.</b></p></center>
<center></center>
<p>On the 12th of August, the CHIEF JUSTICE delivered the following opinion.</p>
<p>BY THE COURT: Â— After a particular examination of the powers vested in this Court, in causes of Equity, as well as in causes of Admiralty and Maritime jurisdiction, we collect a general rule for the government of our proceedings; with a discretionary authority, however, to deviate from that rule, where its application would be injurious or impracticable. The general rule prescribes to us an adoption of that practice, which is founded on the custom and usage of Courts of Admiralty and Equity, constituted on similar principles; but still, it is thought, that we are also authorised to make such deviations as are necessary to adapt the process and rules of the Court to the peculiar circumstances of this country, subject to the interposition, alteration, and controul, of the Legislature<sup>[*]</sup>.</p>
<p>We have, therefore, agreed to make the following general Orders; and the Counsel, in the present case, will take his measures accordingly.</p>
<p>1. ORDERED, That when process at Common Law, or in Equity, shall issue against a State, the same shall be served upon the Governor, or Chief Executive Magistrate, and the Attorney-General, of such State.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*321</span> 2. ORDERED, That process of subpÂœna issuing out of this Court, in any suit in Equity, shall be served on the Defendant sixty days before the return day of the said process: and, further, that if the Defendant, on such service of the subpÂœna, shall not appear at the return day contained therein, the complainant shall be at liberty to proceed ex parte.</p>
<p>Lewis then observed, that the subpÂœna in this case, had been issued on the same principles; but as the orders could only operate in futuro, he thought it best to withdraw his motion for a distringas, and to pray that an alias subpÂœna might be awarded; which was, accordingly, done.</p>

<p><span class="star-pagination">*324</span> ELSWORTH, Chief Justice.</p>
<p>The question, how far a statement of facts by the Circuit Court is conclusive, having been already argued in another cause<sup>[*]</sup>, we are prepared to give an opinion upon that point; but will reserve for further consideration, the objection, that the present decree is not such a statement of facts, as the law contemplates.</p>
<p>If causes of equity or admiralty jurisdiction are removed hither, accompanied with a statement of facts, but without the evidence, it is well; and the statement is conclusive as to all the facts, which it contains. This is unanimously the opinion of the court.</p>
<p>If such causes are removed with a statement of the facts, and also with the evidence; Â— still the statement is conclusive, as to all the facts contained in it. This is the opinion of the court; but not unanimously.</p>
<p>WILSON, Justice.</p>
<p>I consider the rule established by the second proposition to be of such magnitude, that being in the minority on the decision, I am desirous of stating, as briefly as I can, the principles of my dissent.</p>
<p>The decision must, indeed, very materially affect the jurisdiction of all the courts of the United States, particulary of the Supreme Court, as well as the general administration of justice. It becomes more highly important, as it respects the rights and pretensions of foreign nations, who are usually interested in causes of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction.</p>
<p>It appears, however, that two opinions have been formed on this question Â— how far those facts involved in the investigation of a cause of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction, that were <span class="star-pagination">*325</span> given in evidence in the Circuit Court, should, also, appear in this court, on a writ of error or appeal? For my part, I concur in the opinion, that, notwithstanding the provisions of the judicial act, an appeal is the natural and proper mode of removing an admiralty cause; and, in that case, there can be no doubt, that all the testimony which was produced in the court below, should also be produced in this court. Such an appeal is expressly fanctioned by the Constitution; it may, therefore, clearly in the first view of the subject, be considered as the most regular process; and as there are not any words in the judicial act restricting the power of proceeding by appeal, it must be regarded as still permitted and approved. Even, indeed, if a positive restriction existed by law, it would, in my judgment, be superseded by the superior authority of the constitutional provision.</p>
<p>The clauses in the act which more immediately relate to this subject, are the 21st and 22d sections. The material words are these: S. 21, "From final decrees in a District Court in causes of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction, where the matter in dispute exceeds, the sum or value of 300 dollars, exclusive of costs, an appeal shall be allowed to the next Circuit Court to be held in such District." S. 22. "Final decrees and judgments in civil actions in a District Court, where the matter in dispute exceeds the sum or value of 50 dollars, exclusive of costs, may be re-examined and reversed or affirmed in a Circuit Court, holden in the same District, upon a writ of error, whereto shall be annexed and returned therewith at the day and place therein mentioned, an authenticated transcript of the record, and assignment of errors, and prayer for reversal, &amp;c. And upon a like process may final judgments and decrees in civil actions, and suits in equity in a Circuit Court, brought there by original process, or removed there from courts of the several States, or removed there by appeal from a District Court, where the matter in dispute exceeds the value of 2000 dollars, exclusive of costs, be re-examined and reversed or affirmed in the Supreme Court, &amp;c."</p>
<p>Though the term "civil causes" is often descriptively applied, in contradistinction to "criminal causes;" yet, it is not uncommon to apply it, likewise, in contradistinction to causes of Maritime and Admiralty jurisdiction; and, if we carefully compare the two sections to which I have referred, I think the latter distinction will plainly appear to be the genuine object of the Legislature. Thus, in the 21st section, provision is made for removing causes of Admiralty and Maritime jurisdiction by appeal from the District to the Circuit Court; and immediately afterwards, in the 22d section, another provision is made for removing final decrees and judgments in civil actions <span class="star-pagination">*326</span> by writ of error from a District to a Circuit Court. Here, then, is a direct use of the term "civil actions," in contradistinction to "admiralty causes;" and, pursuing the distinct nature of the respective subjects, with technical precision, we find that an appeal is allowed in admiralty causes; and the remedy by writ of error is strictly confined, in this part of the section at leaft, to civil actions.</p>
<p>There would, perhaps, be little difficulty in the case, if the act stopped here. But the 22d section, after mentioning a writ of error, proceeds to declare, that "upon a like process," the final judgments and decrees of the Circuit Court in civil actions, and suits at equity, whether originally instituted there, or removed thither, from the State Court; or by appeal from the District Courts, may be re-examined in the Supreme Court: And it has been urged, that an admiralty cause is a civil suit, and that such a suit being removed by appeal to the Circuit Court, can only be finally transferred to this court by a like process; that is by a writ of error. If, however, causes of admiralty jurisdiction are fairly excluded from the first member of the 22d section, that provides for a removal from the District to the Circuit Court, impartiality and consistency of construction must lead us likewise to exclude them from this member of the section, that provides for a removal from the Circuit to the Supreme Court. By so doing, the two sections of the law can be reconciled; and, by so doing, without including admiralty causes, every description of suit may be reasonably satisfied.</p>
<p>But, if admiralty causes are not to be removed by writ of error from the Circuit Court, to which we see they may be transferred from the District Court by appeal, it has been asked, how they are to be brought hither for final adjudication? It is true, the act of Congress makes no provision on the subject; but, it is equally true, that the constitution (which we must suppose to be always in the view of the Legislature) had previously declared that in certain enumerated cases, including admiralty and maritime cases, "the Supreme Court shall have appellate jurisdiction, both as to law and fact, with such exceptions, and under such regulations as the Congress shall make." The appellate jurisdiction, therefore, flowed, as a consequence, from this source; nor had the Legislature any occasion to do, what the Constitution had already done. The Legislature might, indeed, have made exceptions, and introduced regulations upon the subject; but as it has not done so, the case remains upon the strong ground of the Constitution, which in general terms, and on general principles, provides and authorises an appeal; the process that, in its very nature, (as <span class="star-pagination">*327</span> I have before remarked) implies a re-examination of the fact, as well as the law.</p>
<p>This construction, upon the whole, presents itself to my mind; not only as the natural result of a candid and connected consideration of the Constitution and the act of Congress; but as a position in our system of jurisprudence, essential to the security and the dignity of the United States. And if it is of moment to our domestic tranquillity, and foreign relations, that causes of Admiralty and Maritime jurisdiction, should, in point of fact as well as of law, have all the authority of the decision of our highest tribunal; and if, at the same time, so far from being prohibited, we find it sanctioned by the supreme law of the land; I think the jurisdiction ought to be sustained.</p>
<p>ELSWORTH, Chief Justice.</p>
<p>I will make a few remarks in support of the rule.</p>
<p>The Constitution, distributing the judicial power of the United States, vests in the Supreme Court, an original as well as an appellate jurisdiction. The original jurisdiction, however, is confined to cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, and those in which a State shall be a party. In all other cases, only an appellate jurisdiction is given to the court; and even the appellate jurisdiction is, likewise, qualified; inasmuch as it is given "with such exceptions, and under such regulations, as the Congress shall make." Here then, is the ground, and the only ground, on which we can sustain an appeal. If Congress has provided no rule to regulate our proceedings, we cannot exercise an appellate jurisdiction; and if the rule is provided, we cannot depart from it. The question, therefore, on the constitutional point of an appellate jurisdiction, is simply, whether Congress has established any rule for regulating its exercise?</p>
<p>It is to be considered, then, that the Judicial Statute of the United States speaks of an Appeal and of a Writ of Error; but it does not confound the terms, nor use them promiscuously. They are to be understood, when used, according to their ordinary acceptation, unless something appears in the act itself to controul, modify, or change, the fixed and technical sense which they have previously borne. An appeal is a process of civil law origin, and removes a cause entirely; subjecting the fact as well as the law, to a review and re-trial: but a writ of error is a process of common law origin, and it removes nothing for re-examination but the law. Does the Statute observe this obvious distinction? I think it does. In the 21st section there is a provision for allowing an appeal in Admiralty and maritime causes from the District to the Circuit Court; but it is declared that the matter in dispute must exceed the value of 300 Dollars, or no appeal can be sustained; and yet in <span class="star-pagination">*328</span> the preceeding section, we find, that Decrees and Judgments in civil actions may be removed by writ of error from the District to the Circuit Court, though the value of the matter in dispute barely exceeds 50 dollars. It is unnecessary, however, to make any remark on this apparent diversity: The only question is, whether the civil actions, here spoken of, include causes of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction? Now, the term civil actions would, from its natural import, embrace every species of suit, which is not of a criminal kind; and when, it is considered, that the District Court has a criminal as well as a civil jurisdiction, it is clear, that the term was used by the Legislature, not to distinguish between Admiralty causes, and other civil actions, but to exclude the idea of removing judgments in criminal prosecutions, from an inferior to a superior tribunal. Besides, the language of the first member of the 22d. section seems calculated to obviate every doubt. It is there said, that final Decrees and judgments in civil actions in a District Court may be removed into the Circuit Court upon a writ of error and since there cannot be a decree in the District Court in any case, except cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction, it follows of course, that such cases must be intended, and that if they are removed at all, it can only be done by writ of error.</p>
<p>In this way, therefore, the appellate jurisdiction of the Circuit Court is to be exercised; but it remains to enquire, whether any provision is made, for the exercise of the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court; and, I think, there is, by unequivocal words of reference. Thus, the 22d section of the act declares, that "upon a like process," that is upon a writ of error, final judgments and decrees in civil actions (a description still employed in contradistinction to criminal prosecutions) and suits in equity in the Circuit Court, may be here re-examined and reversed or affirmed. Among the causes liable to be thus brought hither upon a writ of error, are such as had been previously removed into the Circuit Court, "by appeal from a District Court," which can only be causes of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction.</p>
<p>It is observed, that a writ of error is a process more limited in its effects than an appeal: but, whatever may be the operation, if an appellate jurisdiction can only be exercised by this court conformably to such regulations as are made by the Congress, and if Congress has prescribed a writ of error, and no other mode, by which it can be exercised, still, I say, we are bound to pursue that mode, and can neither make, nor adopt, another. The law may, indeed, be improper and inconvenient; but it is of more importance, for a judicial determination, to ascertain what the law is, than to speculate upon what it ought to be. If, however, the construction, that a statement, <span class="star-pagination">*329</span> ment of facts by the Circuit Court is conclusive, would amount to a denial of justice, would be oppressively injurious to individuals, or would be productive of any general mischief, I should then be disposed to resort to any other rational exposition of the law, which would not be attended with these deprecated consequences. But, surely, it cannot be deemed a denial of justice, that a man shall not be permitted to try his cause two or three times over. If he has one opportunity for the trial of all the parts of his case, justice is satisfied; and even if the decision of the Circuit Court had been made final, no denial of justice could be imputed to our government; much less can the imputation be fairly made, because the law directs that in cases of appeal, part shall be decided by one tribunal, and part by another; the facts by the court below, and the law by this court. Such a distribution of jurisdiction has long been established in England.</p>
<p>Nor is there anything in the nature of a fact, which renders it impracticable or improper to be ascertained by a judge; and, if there were, a fact could never be ascertained in this court, in matters of appeal. If, then, we are competent to ascertain a fact when assembled here, I can discern no reason why we should not be equally competent to the task, when sitting in the Circuit Court; nor why it should be supposed, that a judge is more able, or more worthy, to ascertain the facts in a suit in equity (which, indisputably, can only be removed by writ of error) than to ascertain the facts in a cause of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction.</p>
<p>The statute has made a special provision, that the mode of proof, by oral testimony, and examination of witnesses, shall be the same in all the Courts of the United States, as well in the trial of causes in equity and of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction, as of actions at common law: But it was perceived, that, although the personal attendance of witnesses could easily be procured in the District or Circuit Courts, the difficulty of bringing them from the remotest parts of the union to the seat of government, was insurmountable; and, therefore, it became necessary, in every description of suits, to make a statement of the facts in the Circuit Court definitive, upon an appeal to this court.</p>
<p>If, upon the whole, the original constitutional grant of an appellate jurisdiction is to be enforced in the way that has been suggested, then all the testimony must be transmitted, reviewed, re-examined, and settled here; great private and public inconveniency, would ensue; and it was useless to provide that "the Circuit Courts should cause the facts on which they found "their sentence or decree fully to appear upon the record."</p>
<p>But, upon the construction contained in the rule laid down <span class="star-pagination">*330</span> by the Court, there cannot, in any case, be just cause of complaint, as to the question of fact, since it is ascertained by an impartial and enlightened tribunal; and, as to the question of law, the re-examination in this court is wisely meant and calculated to preserve unity of principle, in the administration of justice throughout the United States.<sup>[*]</sup></p>
<p>On the 12th of August, the CHIEF JUSTICE delivered the opinion of the court upon the point, whether there was, in this cause, such a statement of facts, as the Legislature contemplated?</p>
<p>BY THE COURT: Â— The decree states, that certain conveyances are fraudulent; and had it stopped with that general declaration, some doubt might reasonably be entertained, whether it was not more properly an inference, than the statement of a fact; since fraud must always principally depend upon the quo animo. But the court immediately afterwards proceed to describe the fraud, or quo animo, declaring, that "the conveyances were intended to defraud the complainant, and to prevent his obtaining satisfaction for a just demand;" which is not an inference from a fact, but a statement of the fact itself. It is another fact illustrative of this position, that "the grantee was a party and privy to the fraud."</p>
<p>We are, therefore, of opinion, that the Circuit Court have sufficiently caused the facts, on which they decided, to appear from the pleadings and decree, in conformity to the act of Congress.</p>
<p>The decree affirmed.</p>

<p><span class="star-pagination">*332</span> BY THE COURT: It appears, that the damages have been assessed in the courts below, in relation to the value of the goods that were captured: but the Plaintiffs in error were not trespassers ab initio; and, acting only as agents, they should be made answerable for no more than actually came into their hands. The accounts of sales are regularly collected and annexed to the record. We are, therefore, at no loss for a criterion: And we think that the decree should be so modified, as to charge them with the amount of sales, after deducting the duties on the goods, if the duties were paid by them.</p>
<p>The Decree was in the following words: Â— ORDERED, That the decree of the Circuit Court for Georgia district, pronounced on the 5th of May, 1795, be reversed, so far as the same respects the said Hills, May and Woodbridge; and it is further ordered, that the said Hills, May and Woodbridge, pay to the said Walter Ross, thirty-two thousand and ninety dollars and fifty-eight cents, the net amount of the sales of the cargo of the said ship, and five thousand six hundred and five dollars and twelve cents, interest thereon, from the 6th day of June 1794, to the twelfth day of August 1796, making together the sum of thirty-seven thousand six hundred and ninety-five dollars and seventy cents, and that the said Hills, May and Woodbridge, do pay the costs of suit Â— and a special mandate, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="indent">This was a writ of Error to the High Court of Appeals, of the State of Maryland, to remove the proceedings in a cause, involving a construction of the treaty of peace between the United States and Great Britain, which that Court had decided against the title claimed under the Treaty, by reversing and annulling a previous judgment given in the General Court of the State, in favor of the claim. The only objection arising on the record, was-whether a paper money payment of a British debt into the treasury of Maryland, during the war, by virtue of a law of the state, was a bar to the creditor's recovery at this time? And the solemn adjudication in Ware vs. Hylton et al. ant. p. 199. having settled that point, Dallas, for the Defendant in error, submitted the case, without argument, to the Court, who, in general terms, reversed the judgment of the High Court of Appeals, and affirmed the judgment of the General Court.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p4">
<span class="num">4</span>
<p class="indent">It then became a question, to which of the State Courts the Mandate should be sent, and what costs should be allowed.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p5">
<span class="num">5</span>
<p class="indent">E. and W. Tilghman, for the Plaintiff in error, contended, that the judgment of the Court of Appeals being reversed, it was to be regarded as if it had never existed; and that, therefore, the mandate must issue to the General Court, whose judgment was to be carried into effect. They insisted, also, that the costs in both the Courts of Maryland, and in this Court should be allowed.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p6">
<span class="num">6</span>
<p class="indent">Dallas, on the other side, stated, that by the 25th. section of the Judicial Act, the writ of error was to have the same effect in this case, as if the judgment, or decree, complained of, had been rendered or passed in a Circuit Court, and that the proceeding upon the reversal was also to be the same, except that after once being remanded, this Court may proceed to a final decision, and award execution. In the case, then, of a reversal of a Judgment of the Circuit Court, the 24th, section of the Judicial Act provides, that on reversals in the Supreme Court, they shall proceed to render such judgment, or pass such Decree, as the Inferior Court should have done; and shall send a special mandate to the Circuit Court to award execution thereupon. If, therefore, the Decree of a Circuit, reversing the Decree of a District, Court, were reversed, the mandate would be sent to the former, and not to the latter, and by a parity of reasoning in the present instance, the writ should be sent to the Court of Appeals, and not to the General Court. The construction seems to be strengthened by that part of the 25th. section, which contemplates, that the cause might be remanded to the State Court more than once; as, it is not probable, that the Court whose judgment is affirmed, would require a second order; and, it is surely proper, that the Court, whose judgment is reversed, should be apprised of the event. As to costs, Dallas contended, that at least the costs of the Court, whose judgment was in favor of the Defendant in Error, ought not to be charged against him.</p>

<p>Though I was silent on the occasion, I concurred in opinion with Judge Wilson upon the second rule laid down in Wiscart v. D'Auchy; and, of course, the court were divided, four to two, upon the decision. I thought, indeed, that excluding a consideration of the evidence (which, virtually, amounts to a statement of facts) was shutting the door against light and truth; and was leaving the property of the country too much to the discretion and judgment of a single Judge. But conceiving myself bound by the rule, and that, in some shape, the facts must be made to appear on the record, I have always since thought it my duty to make a statement, where the counsel would not, or could not, agree in forming one.</p>
<p>As to the present point, though there is no express determination, it was the subject of discussion among the Judges at their chamber; an opinion was formed, but not delivered, by the same majority, that established the second rule in Wiscart versus D'Auchy; and the reasoning of the Chief Justice in support of that rule, went clearly to this case. I do nor, therefore, think, that any new argument can be necessary. However disposed I might have been originally to give the most liberal construction to the act of Congress, the decision of the Court precludes me from considering the evidence, at this time, as a statement of facts; and if there is no statement of facts, the consequences seems naturally to follow, that there can be no error.</p>
<p>THE COURT concurring in the representation made by Judge PATERSON, they proceeded, without further argument on the principal question, to</p>
<p>Affirm the Decree.</p>
<p>E. Tilghman suggested, however, that the damages were very high, and that, in fact, an allowance for counsel fees was included, though it did not appear on the record.</p>
<p>Du Ponceau, urged, that the court could not travel out of the record to ascertain a fact. In the case where an allowance for counsel's fees had been struck out, that charge and all the items on which damages had been awarded, were stated in an account annexed to the record.<sup>[*]</sup></p>
<p>CHASE, Justice:</p>
<p>An account of items, as a foundation to award damages, was exhibited in the court below: but it is a sufficient answer here, that the allowance does not appear on the record.</p>
<p>THE COURT concurred in this opinion; and Du Ponceau prayed an encrease of damages for the delay occasioned by bringing this writ of error, contending, that under the 23d section of the <span class="star-pagination">*338</span> Judicial Act, damages for delay were peremptorily prescribed, and that the discretion of the court only went to the award of single or double costs.</p>
<p>But, BY THE COURT: Â— The prize was sold by the agreement of the parties, the Captor and the French Consul; but the money was afterwards stopped in the hands of the Marshal, upon a monition issued by a third person (the original owner of the prize) who was not a party to the agreement. The decree must be affirmed without an encrease of damages; and the interest to the present day, must run upon the debt only, and not on the damages.</p>
<p>Du Ponceau, next prayed an allowance of 12 dollars and 50 cents, the cost of a printed state of the case for the use of the Judges.</p>
<p>But THE COURT observed, that, however convenient it might be, there was no rule authorising the charge; and, therefore, it could not be allowed.<sup>[*]</sup></p>

  Jennings and Venner, Plaintiffs in Error, versus the brig ||  Writ of Error
    Perseverance and her cargo, or the monies arising       || from the Circuit
    therefrom, in the hands of William Peck, Esq.            &gt; Court, for the
    Marshal of the district of Rhode Island, and Louis      ||    district of
    Arcambal, Claimant and Defendant in Error.              ||  Rhode Island.
</p>
<p>Proceedings in the District Court, 20th September, 1794.</p>
<p>THE now Plaintiffs in error, subjects of the King of Great Britain, file their Libel, complaining of the capture made on the 27th of July preceding, of their brig Perseverance and her cargo, on the high feas, on a voyage from Turks Island, to St. John's New Brunswick.</p>
<p>They state that she was captured by two armed vessels, each of about 35 tons burthen, one called the Sanspareil, the other the Senora, brought into the district of Rhode Island, under the care of John Baptiste Bernard, prize-master, sold by his order at Providence, for 5028 dollars, and the proceeds lodged in the hands of the Marshal of the district where they now are.</p>
<p>They complain that the Senora was originally sitted out, and the force of the Sanspareil was encreased and augmented, by adding to the number of guns and gun carriages, at Charleston, South Carolina, with intent to cruize, &amp;c.</p>
<p>That at the time of capture, there were on board both the captured vessels, divers citizens of the United States, to wit, on board the Sanspareil 12, and on board the Serona 21, all of whom were aiding and assisting at the capture.</p>
<p>That there was no person on board of either of the capturing vessels duly commissioned to make captures, &amp;c.</p>
<p>They pray restitution of the vessel and cargo, or the proceeds thereof.</p>
<p>PROCESS SERVED IN DUE FORM.</p>
<p>FIRST MONDAY IN NOVEMBER, 1794.</p>
<p>John Baptiste Bernard, prize-master, appears and pleads to the jurisdiction of the court Â— he grounds his plea upon the following reasons:</p>
<p>1st. That the legality of the capture had already been determined under the authority of the United States* and agreeably to the practice of nations, and in the mode required at the special instance of the Libellants, by their public Consul, resident in the said district of Rhode Island.</p>
<p>2d. That the custody of the proceeds of the prize had come to the Marshal in due course of law, and not under the authority of the court Â— therefore the disposal thereof was not under its jurisdiction.</p>
<p>3d. That the sale of the prize having been made on land, Admiralty had no jurisdiction.</p>
<p>4th. That there was an adequate remedy at common law, by an action against the Marshal for money had and received.</p>
<p>5th. That the prize was made from British subjects in open war, on the high feas, by the crew of the schooner Sanspareil, belonging to citizens of the French Republic, commanded by a French citizen, manned with more than two thirds of her crew by French seamen and marines, and bearing a commission of war under the French Republic.</p>
<p>Concludes to the jurisdiction only, prays that the court will take no further cognizance, but that the libel be dismissed.</p>
<p>No replication or further pleadings appear on the record, the decree of the District Court appears to have been given on the libel and plea only, and is in the following words:</p>
<p>Nov. 6th, 1794. `Upon mature consideration of the allegations in the `libel contained, and of the plea of the claimants against the jurisdiction `of the court thereon, and of the arguments of the counsel, &amp;c. it `appears to me that the reasons assigned, or most of them, are to the merits `of the cause, and not to the jurisdiction of the court, that they are `altogether insufficient to take the cognizance and jurisdiction of the `court from the present cause as set forth in the said libel, and therefore `I do sustain the jurisdiction of the court thereon.'</p>
<p>* By documents annexed to, and making a part of the record, it appears, that previous to this suit being instituted, the Libellants, represented by the British consul, preferred the same complaints that are contained in their libel to the Governor of Rhode Island, who, in consequence of the said complaint, and in pursuance of instructions from the Executive of the United States, which are also annexed to the record, did hear the merits of the said complaint in a solemn judicial form, upon evidence produced and examined on both sides, and finally dismissed the said complaint, on the ground of its being unsupported by evidence. After this decree no rule to answer over appears to have been prayed by the libellants, no further pleadings appear upon the record, but immediately after the said decree, an entry is made in these words:</p>
<p>`This cause was continued to the next February term, to be heard on `the merits.'</p>
<p>The cause is then continued successively, by consent of the parties, to August term 1795, when the Judge prohounced his final decree; the record of which is as follows.</p>
<p>`This cause having been continued, by consent of the parties, from `term to term, ever since November term, in the year one thousand seven `hundred and ninety-four, for trial upon the merits Â— it was now `further moved by the counsel for the libellants, that the same be further `continued to next November term, to procure further evidence, `this motion was opposed by the counsel for the claimant:, for that the `cause had been continued three terms, beyond which a further indulgence `would be unreasonable. Upon a full hearing thereof, it seemed `to the court, that the cause ought not to be further continued, and the `judgment of the court was, that the said motion for a continuance be `over-ruled Â— Whereupon the cause being called for hearing upon the `merits, the libellants declined and refused to offer any proofs or arguments `in support of their said libel, and thereupon I do adjudge, that `the said libel be dismissed and do further adjudge, order and decree, `that the proceeds arising from the sales of the said bring Perseverance `and her cargo, in the hands of the said William Peck, amounting to `5028 dollars, be by him, the said William Peck, restored, given up, `and paid to the said John Baptiste Bernard, claimant in the said cause, `and respondent to the said libel, first deducting therefrom the duties paid `into the custom-house on the said cargo, and the commission arising on `the sales of said brig and cargo, together with such other expenses as `this court may allow or decree Â— and I do further order, adjudge and `decree that the said libellants pay to the said John Baptiste Bernard, `claimant in this cause, as damages occasioned by the detention of said `monies arising from the sales of the said brig Perseverance, after said `deduction so to be made as aforesaid, the interest of the same from the `24th day of September, in the year 1794, to the day of the date of this `decree, at the rate of six per cent. per annum, as the same shall be cast `and reported by the clerk of this court, upon the sum to be restored and `paid by the said William Peck, together with 300 dollars in full of all `other damages and costs sustained or expended in and about this cause."</p>
<p>First Monday in August, 1795.</p>
<p>Upon which an appeal was interposed by the Libellants.</p>
<p>PROCEEDINGS IN THE CIRCUIT COURT.</p>
<p>The first proceedings in this court are on the 20th of June 1796, when Louis Arcambal, Vice Consul of the French Republic, appears in the cause and files his claim, praying that the libel be dismissed, and the proceeds of the prize be delivered up to him with damages and costs.</p>
<p>He is admitted as claimant without any opposition. No further pleadings appear to have taken place in this court. On the 25th of June, 1796, the court proceeds to decree on the appeal in these words:</p>
<p>`Decreed, that so much of the decree of the District Court as decreed `that the libel be dismissed, be and hereby is affirmed, and that the residue `of the said decree be and hereby is reversed Â— and it is further ordered `and decreed, that the proceeds arising from the sales of the said `brig Perseverance in the hands of William Peck, amounting to 5028 `dollars, be by him restored and paid to Louis Arcambal, Vice Consul `of the French Republic, admitted by this court as claimant in this `cause for the use of the owners, officers, and crew of the armed schooner `Sanspareil, first deducting therefrom the duties paid into the custom-house `on the said cargo, and the commission on the sales Â— it is further `ordered and decreed, that the said libellants pay to the said Louis `Arcambal for the use of the owners, officers and crew aforesaid, for `damages occasioned by the detention of the said monies arising from `the sales of the said brig Perseverance and her cargo (after the deduction `aforesaid) 800 dollars, and also the interest, at the rate of six per `cent per annum, on the money in the hands of the said William Peck, `(after the deductions aforesaid) from the 24th of September, 1794, to `the date of this decree, together with the costs in the District Court, and `this court.'</p>
<p>Whereupon a writ of error is prayed by Thomas Jennings and John L. Venner, and allowed.</p>
<p>No assignment of errors appears to have been filed in the Court below, according to law[*]; the facts on which the Circuit Court founded their decree, do not appear either from the pleadings and decree itself, or from a statement made by the parties or by the court.</p>
<p>It is intended by the Defendants in error to object to any error in fact being assigned or argued by the Plaintiffs, agreeably to the 22d section of the judiciary act, and for the following reasons:</p>
<p>1. That it was the duty of the Plaintiffs in error, to see that the facts were made to appear on the record, otherwise the court will presume that the facts found by the Circuit Court were such as warranted the inference of law, which they thought proper to draw from them. That on the authority of the cases of the United States v. La Vengeance, Pintado v. Berard, and Wiscart v. Dauehy, determined at the last Supreme Court, this court cannot, without the consent of the parties, go into the examination of the evidence annexed to the record.</p>
<p>2. That the Defendants cannot give their consent to going to a hearing upon the evidence, because this matter has been kept depending in various shapes, for a period of almost three years, at the instance of the Plaintiffs, who have had three hearings upon the merits. 1st. Before the Governor of Rhode Island. 2d. Before the District Court. 3d. Before the Circuit Court.</p>
<p>3. Because the Executive of the United States, had competent authority, by the usage of nations and the law of the land, to decide, whether or not there was ground for restitution in the present case; and whether its jurisdiction be exclusive of, or concurrent with, the judicial courts, its decision, obtained on the application of the libellants, is a bar to the present suit, and even if the Governor of Rhode Island, had no legal jurisdiction or cognizance of the case, his decision ought to be final, as the award of an arbitrator, or amicable judge, agreed upon by the parties.</p>
<p>If, nevertheless, the Court should be of a contrary opinion, the cause will remain to be examined on the evidence, which is annexed to the record, and is too lengthy to admit of an analysis in this statement, and from that evidence the following points will arise.</p>
<p>1st. A point of fact: Whether the charges exhibited in the libel are supported, and if so,</p>
<p>2d. The point of law: Whether the facts so stated in the libel are a sufficient ground in law for a judicial restitution.</p>
<p>Upon the whole, the Defendants in Error pray that the decree of the Circuit Court may be affirmed with costs and damages for the delay,</p>
<p>[*] The general error has been assigned since the record came up. Admitted nunc pro tunc. to wit, the lawful interest of the State of Rhode Island, being six per centum per annum, on the balance in the hands of the Marshal of the said district, and also on the sum of eight hundred dollars awarded as damages by the said Circuit Court, to be computed from the 25th of June, 1796, the date of the said decree.</p>

<p class="indent">Error from the Circuit Court, for the District of Rhode Island. The case was as follows: On the 10th of March, 1792, Brown and Francis, merchants, of Providence, in Rhode Island, drew four sets of bills of exchange on Thomas Dickason and Co. merchants, of London, payable at 365 days sight, to Benjamin Page, or order, for the aggregate sum of L. 3000 sterling. Page being at Canton on the 28th of March, 1793, endorsed these bills to Van Braam, the Defendant in error, and on the same day, as the agent of Brown and Francis, drew another set of bills of exchange, upon Thomas Dickason and Co. payable, also, at 365 days sight, to Van Braam, or order, for L. 3000 sterling. 3N the 9th of April, 1793, Page, in the same character of agent, drew a similar set of bills, in favor of Van Braam, or order, for L. 400 sterling. 3Ne bill of each set was presented to Thomas Dickason and Co. in London, for acceptance, on the 31st of December, 1793, but were then protested for non-acceptance, of which Brown and Francis had notice on the 1st of July, 1794, though the bills and protests were not actually returned to them. The bills were again presented for payment on the 15th of January, 1795, (that is 10 days after they were actually due) and protested for non-payment, of which Brown and Francis had notice on the 1st of Paril, 1795. This action was instituted in the Circuit Court of November Term, 1796, to recover the amount of the protested bills, with interest, damages and charges; and the declaration contained a special count on each bill, together with a general indebitatus assumpsit for 40,000 dollars, money had and received by the Defendants, to the use of the Plaintiff. On the return of the record it appeared, that Francis had died subsequent to the service of the original writ; that Brown came into court, and, after suggesting the death of Francis, pleaded the general issue; and that the Plaintiff having, likewise, suggested the death of Francis 'prayed judgment against John Brown, the surviving Defendant.' There was no joinder in issue, continuance, or other pleading; but immediately after the above prayer for judgment, the record proceeds, in this form: 'And the said John Brown made default: Whereupon, this cause being submitted to the court, and the court having fully heard the parties by their counsel, and mature deliberation being thereon had, it is considered by the court now here, that the said Andreal E. Van Braam Houchgeest, do recover against the said John Brown, the surviving partner as aforesaid, the sum of thirty four thousand four hundred and fifty five dollars, and twenty seven cents damages, and costs of suit, taxed at sixteen dollars and fifty two cents.' To the record of this judgment, the following memorandum was annexed: 'Nota Bene. The above sum, as ordered by the court, includes the principal and interest from the 15th January, 1795, to the 19th November, 1796, and ten per cent damages, and twenty nine dollars, and twenty two cents, charges of protest.'</p>

<div class="num" id="p6">
<span class="num">6</span>
<p class="indent">For the Plaintiff in Error. 1st Error assigned: It appears from the record, that there was a discontinuance of the cause, by an omission of the Plaintiff below, and no verdict or judgment can cure the defect. The Defendant had come in, and tendered an issue upon every count in the declaration; and, without a joinder of issue, or any species of replication, the suggestion of the death of Francis, is the only thing that occurs between the Defendant's plea, thus traversing the whole cause of action, and the judgment against him by default. It does not appear, that the Plaintiff himself was in court; nor, indeed, under all the circumstances of the record can it be conclusively ascertained, for whom judgment ought to have been given. It is true, that by the courtesy of the bar, the similiter might, perhaps, have been entered at any time, while the cause was depending in the original jurisdiction; but till it was entered, the Defendant by pleading had done everything that law or reason could exact from him; and it is too late to enter it, when the cause is removed upon a writ of error. In deciding on this exception, the Court will be governed by the law of Rhode Island, by virtue of the reference made in the thirty fourth section of the Judicial Act, to the laws of the several States, as rules of decision in trials at common law, in the Courts of the United States, where they apply. But the law of Rhode Island must not be construed to recognize any loose system of practice, introduced upon the principles of mutual indulgence for the personal accommodation of attornies. By an act of the state it is declared, that in all cases, for which the Legislature has made no positive provision, the laws of England shall furnish the rule of decision. If, therefore, any custom, usage, or practice, shall be in opposition to an express statute of Rhode Island; or where there is no statute on the subject, if it shall oppugn the principles of the common law of England, it is void, and ought to be disregarded. In the present instance, there is no express statute; but the discontinuance is fatal at common law; and, therefore, fatal by the law of Rhode Island. There can be no judgment by default, after an appearance, much less after pleading; but the Plaintiff should have entered the similiter, and then he would have been entitled to make out his case before a jury, whether the defendant attended, or not, to support his plea. As the record stands it cannot be understood what was tried, an issue in fact, or a demurrer in law<a class="footnote" href="#fna" id="fna_ref">a</a></p>

<p class="indent">2nd. Error assigned. By the law of Rhode Island,<a class="footnote" href="#fnb" id="fnb_ref">b</a> it is declared, 'that when any bill or bills of exchange shall be returned from any parts beyond sea, duly protested for nonacceptance, or non-payment, the person or persons to whom the same was (or were) payable, shall be entitled to have and recover of the drawer or drawers, endorser or endorsers of the bill or bills of exchange, ten per cent damages, over and above the principal sum, for which such protested bill, or bills of exchange so protested, was or were drawn, and also lawful interest from the time such bill or bills of exchange so protested, were purchased, until final judgment for the same be obtained, and also legal charges of protesting said</p>

<p class="indent"> Paterson, Justice. I shall certainly consider myself bound in some cases, by the practice of the State Courts; and, therefore, I wish to get a practical exposition of the statute, to ascertain whether the judgment by default can be considered as good for nothing, after there has been such a discontinuance as the present.</p>

<p class="indent">Chase, Justice. I shall be governed, in forming my opinion, by what the common law says must be the effect of a judgment by default; without regarding the practice of the State.

<p class="indent">'bill (or bills) with costs of suit.' It is agreed, that, under this law, damages might have been recovered upon the protest for non-acceptance merely; but then the bills and protest for non-acceptance, must have been returned in a reasonable time; whereas they were not returned till a year had elapsed; the bills were protested for non-payment; and in point of fact, it is conceded, that the action is brought upon the protest for non-payment, and not upon the protest for non-acceptance. The notice of the non-acceptance will not alter the case; for the bills with the protest should have been returned to the drawers, so as to put it in their power to take them up, and to pursue their remedy over against the drawee, in case he had their affects in his hands at the time of protest. Then considering the case upon the protest for non-payment, no damages ought to be allowed, unless the bills were duly protested; and it appears, from the Plaintiff's own shewing, that they were not protested for ten days after they had become payable, which is not so soon as it might have been from the nature of the case, or as it ought to have been according to the law of merchants, by which only three days grace are allowed. It is true, that this protest may be in time for one purpose at common law, for instance, to maintain an action against the drawer, who had no assets in the hands of the drawee, at the time of protest; and yet the bills shall not be deemed duly protested for another purpose, by statute, for instance, to entitle the payee to recover damages.</p>

<div class="num" id="p10">
<span class="num">10</span>
<p class="indent">It will be urged, however, that the allowance of damages, only appears by the nota bene subjoined to the judgment of the court below, and that this ought not to be taken into consideration as a part of the record. But what constitutes a record, is a very different thing, in different states. The mode of stating the judgment, or the reasons for it, will, likewise, admit of great latitude and diversity. If the purport of the nota bene had been incorporated with the judgment, there would have been no ground for cavil; and where is the substantial difference, whether the judge delivers the explanation himself, or directs it (which, for aught that appears, may be the fact) to be entered by the clerk? If the court had confined its view to the mere formal part of the record in the case of Bingham Plaintiff in error versus Cabot, (ant. p. 19.) the ground of reversing the judgment below could never have appeared; and if the nota bene is reversed here, it cannot be determined what has been tried by the court below. But, after all, the allowance of damages must necessarily be inferred from the record, independent of the nota bene. Thus, the declaration sets forth and demands the principal interest, cost and damages, accruing by virtue of certain bills of exchange; and the demand being reducible to certainty by figures, this court can follow the court below, and by mere calculation, from data existing on the record, correct any error that has been committed. Since, then, there is a judgment for more than the principal, interest, and costs upon the bills of exchange, the surplus must be error; and the nota bene only serves to explain how that surplus has arisen.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p11">
<span class="num">11</span>
<p class="indent">3rd. Error assigned. The damages ought not to have been assessed by the court. It is admitted, that where a demand appears to a certainty upon the record, or may be reduced to a certainty by the use of figures, the court may itself make the calculation, or refer it to the proper officer to be done. 3 Leon. 213. 1 Hen. Black 541. If, therefore, the declaration had demanded nothing more than appears on the face of the bills, the present exception could not prevail; because the specific sum to be adjudged might be conclusively ascertained by adding, upon a simple process of figures, the amount of the interest to the principal; though even that doctrine has been controverted in a very recent case. 4. T. Rep. 275. But the demand is not only for the principal and interest, but, likewise, for damages, which are altogether uncertain; depending upon the fact, that the bills have been returned duly protested; and that fact involving a complicated investigation into the period of the return, as well as into the time and mode of protest. Even, indeed, with respect to the interest, a similar uncertainty arises under the provision of the Rhode Island law; since interest is to be allowed from the time of purchasing the bills; and, therefore, the time of purchasing the bills was a fact to be ascertained, before any calculation could be made. But exclusive of these points, necessarily connected with the bills, the Defendant under the general issue, which he had tendered, was entitled to bring a great variety of matters into his defence. As there is much diversity in the laws on this subject, some allowing 20 per cent. others only 10 per cent damages, and some no specific damages at all, the place of drawing the bills may be material. Nor can it be said, that the judgment by default, even if it had been regularly entered, would admit all that is demanded in the declaration; it admits the cause of action as stated, but does not admit the quantum of the demand. The Defendant might, therefore, have shown an endorsement after the bills were dishonored, and a subsequent payment, on the principle laid down in Term Report, 82. for, an endorsement in such case is not conclusive against the drawer. 12.

<p class="indent">It is not contended, that, under the principles of the English law, or the usage of New England, the form of a writ of enquiry is indispensable, to ascertain damages upon every judgment by default; but wherever matters of fact can be separated from matters of law, it will be agreed to be a general and favorite practice, to allot the assessment of damages to a jury. The ancient authorities are, it is true, exceedingly crude in relation to the distribution of jurisdiction between judges and juries; but we have received the doctrine in its modern, perfect, and as such, are deeply interested in adhering to it. So forcible is the modern example of the English courts, that the judges have refused even to value foreign money; 4 T. Rep. 493; and a motion for referring a bill of exchange, drawn for Irish sterling, to the matter, in order to see what was due, for principal interest and costs, has been recently rejected in Westminster Hall. 5 T. Rep. 87. It is here, indeed, to be remarked, that the bills of exchange, in the present instance, were drawn for British sterling money; which is, surely, as much to be denominated foreign money in an American court, as Irish sterling can be so denominated in an English court.<a class="footnote" href="#fn-s" id="fn-s_ref">*</a> Besides, it is to be considered, that in England damages are compensatory; while in Rhode Island, in most of the other states in the Union, and in many foreign countries, damages are in the nature of a penal sum, given by statute; and not a solitary authority can be produced, where any court has referred a bill of exchange to the Prothonotary, to add by way of damages, any sum beyond the precise computation of interest.</p>

<p class="indent">The doctrine having, then, been thus settled in England, the question arises, whether the statutes of Rhode Island have made any difference in the common law? By the act, regulating the proceedings in the courts of that State (page 59.) it is provided, 'That in all cases, both at the inferior and superior courts, where judgment shall pass by default, discontinuance, nihil dicit, non sum informatus, or demurrer, where damages are to be enquired into and assessed, damages shall be enquired into and assessed by the court, or otherwise, by a writ of enquiry, at the descretion of the courts.' This provision may be regarded in two points of view; 1st, Considering it, upon the ground of the opposite construction, whether it furnishes a rule for the Federal Courts, from which they can derive any new authority; and 2nd. Considering it, upon the ground of our construction, whether the assessment of the damages ought not to have been referred to a jury. 1st. On the first of these grounds of consideration, there is no key to an explanation, but the act of Congress; which declares that the laws of the several States, except where the Constitution, treaties or statutes of the United States shall otherwise require or provide, shall be regarded as rules of decision in trials at common law in the courts of the United States, in cases where they apply.' Now, though this is an adoption of the laws of Rhode Island, where they apply, it cannot be considered as a recognition of all the modes of practice, which may have been introduced to determine the rights of a party; compelling the Federal Courts, whatever may be the extravagance of those modes, to be in all respects as erratic as the courts of the States. For instance; though where the State law regulates the descent of real property, the Circuit Court must decide conformably to the lex loci; yet if the State Legislature had instituted the ordeal, or trial by battle, to ascertain who was the right heir, the Judges of the Circuit Court would not, surely, erect themselves into such a tribunal, and preside at such a mockery. If the Federal Courts should attempt to alter the fundamental laws of descent, the citizens of Massachusetts, or Rhode Island, would have reason to complain, and the complaint would certainly be heard; but if, disdaining to sanctify the errors of clerks, and the blunders of yearlings (to whom too often the business of keeping and making up a record is confided) the Federal Courts should discountenance and reject the errors and irregularities of the practice of the State Courts, every suitor would gratefully acknowledge the obligation. There is, perhaps, occasion to lament, that errors in jurisprudence have too long kept the citizens of the Eastern States in darkness, ignorant of their rights and duties; and it is one of the beneficial consequences, that may be fairly expected from the establishment of the national government, that such amendments will every where be introduced into the practice of the law, as are confident with substantial justice, legislative acts, and ancient usages, approved by experience, or favored by local peculiarities. Take the law and practice of Rhode Island, however, to be such as they are described by the opposite counsel, they cannot prevail over an express law of Congress. In this case, there can be no denial that the plea tendered an issue in fact; and all trials of issues in fact must, says the judicial act, be by jury. 2nd. But it is not necessary to insist further on this ground, since a true construction of the Rhode Island law itself, must give the assessment of damages to a jury. The law says that, in certain cases, 'damages shall be enquired into and assessed by the court, or otherwise, by a writ of enquiry, at the discretion of the courts.' If, then, discretion here means a found legal discretion, and not mere will, whim and caprice, it must be applied to a discernment and corresponding allotment of the cases, in which the law authorises a court to fix the quantum of debt, and in which it demands the interference of a jury for the assessment of damages. The opposite construction leads to the absurdest consequences. The Judge might, at pleasure, submit a promissory note to a jury for the mere calculation of interest; and undertake himself to assess the damages in an action for a libel, when judgment has been given on demurrer for the plaintiff. In the latter instance, he would be obliged to try the truth of the allegation and the credibility of the witnesses, and to decide the extent of the injury which the libel has produced; and if a judgment thus preposterously rendered should be brought hither, this court would be bound to affirm it: But there is surely no case, consistently with the scope of the judicial act, where the Circuit Court can decide a point of law, without affording an opportunity upon the record, for its being examined, affirmed, or reversed on a writ of error. In equity causes, it is provided, that the facts on which the decree of the Circuit Court is founded, shall be made to appear upon the record; and in common law causes the principle equally applies, that a Judge ought not to be allowed to travel over ground, where he can never be traced. Then, if the discretion mentioned in the Rhode Island act is a legal discretion to ascertain the distributive jurisdiction between Judges and Juries, and not an authority for the former to blend and usurp the powers of the latter; and if the Judges in this case have decided what the Jury ought to have assessed; it is an error in point of law, which this court is competent to correct. Whatever may be the practice of the lawyers of Rhode Island, it is but a construction of the law, and not the law itself; and if it is an erroneous construction, this court, so far from being bound to adopt, is bound to reject, it. Nor is the error cured by any statute of Jeossaile. The case from 7 Vin. Abr. p. 308. pl. 24. only shows that the want of a formal writ of error was cured, where the damages appeared to have been, in fact, assessed by a jury: but there is no reason in the case itself, or in the cases there cited, that if damages had not been assessed at all, or had been assessed by an improper tribunal, the error would not be fatal.</p>

<p class="indent">For the Defendant in error. 1st. Error assigned. It will be proper to premise, on general principles, that great difficulties must have arisen in organising the Federal Courts, so as to prevent an injurious clashing with the jurisdiction and practice of the various State Courts. From these difficulties there could be found no other mode of escaping, than by adopting, for the government of the Federal Courts, the same law and practice that prevailed in the respective States, in which those courts, from time to time, exercised their functions. The policy of the measure was likewise supported by its tendency to make the new government fit easy on the public mind, and to facilitate the administration of justice throughout the Union. For, as the law and forms of the respective State Courts had been adopted in order to accomplish substantial justice, according to the peculiar and local circumstances of each State; and as the people were content under the operation of those municipal regulations; it was natural to presume, that by adopting the same rule for the Federal Courts, the same salutary effect would be produced. But, on the other hand, it is obvious that any project for a general system of jurisprudence, co-extensive with the Union, could only have engendered discontents, and must have been abortive. To have attempted a theory of law and practice entirely novel, would have occasioned endless perplexity; and to have superseded the settled practice of some States, in order to introduce the practice of others; to compel, for instance, the lawyers of Massachusetts, to study and enforce the practice of the lawyers of South Carolina, would have occasioned endless jealousy and inconvenience. From these considerations the Congress wisely enacted, 'That the laws of the several States, except where the constitution, treaties, or statutes, of the United States shall otherwise require or provide, shall be regarded as rules of decision in trials at common law in the courts of the United States, in cases where they apply.' This adoption of the State laws, extends as well to the unwritten, as to the written law; to the law arising from established usage and judicial determinations, as well as to the law created by positive acts of the Legislature. And the act for regulating process, in language equally general adopts 'in each State respectively, such forms and modes as are used or allowed in the Supreme Courts of the same<a class="footnote" href="#fn-s-1" id="fn-s-1_ref">*</a>.' The only question, therefore, to ascertain the legal correctness of the present record, is what are the laws and modes adopted by the State of Rhode Island, in relation to the controverted points? It is immaterial, how far the answer shall be inconsistent with certain dogma of the English common law, or at variance with the municipal regulations of any other State; it is enough to show that such are the laws and modes of Rhode Island, and that they are competent to all the purposes of justice.</p>

<p class="indent">With respect, then, to the assignment of error, because there was a discontinuance of the suit, a reference to the uniform practice of Rhode Island, must furnish a decisive refutation. Both in the Court of Common pleas, and the Superior Court of that State, the Court proceeds to call the parties in the actions depending on the Docket. If either party neglects to appear, in whatever state of the pleadings, his non-appearance is noted by the clerk, and judgment is rendered for the other party. If, as in the present instance, a plea has been pleaded; and, on calling over the Docket, the Plaintiff appears, and the Defendant does not, the judgment is entered for the Plaintiff without regarding the plea. If, on the other hand, the Defendant had appeared, and the Plaintiff had not, judgment would have been entered, in favor of the former, for costs. But, if both had appeared, whenever called by the Court, the similiter could be entered at any time, and it is usual to enter it at the time of qualifying the Jury. Even, however, where an issue has been regularly joined, the Court never proceed to try it, unless both parties appear; but enter judgment, as above stated, against the delinquent.<a class="footnote" href="#fn-s-2" id="fn-s-2_ref">*</a> Thus, it is plain, that the non-attendance of the Defendant, is considered in the practice of Rhode Island as an abandonment of his plea: Nor is the practice without sanction from the books of English law; which show how a departure of a party in despite of the Court, will be recorded, and how in almost any stage of a suit, it may be a ground for rendering judgment against him. 7 Vin.

<p class="indent">2nd. Error assigned. The allowance of damages only appears on the nota bene annexed to the record, which was an act of supererogation on the part of the clerk, and ought to be treated as mere surplusage. If, however, the Court were right in assessing the damages themselves, the assessment stands in the place of a writ of enquiry; and surely the principles on which a Jury give their verdict, can never be the foundation for a writ of error. Bills of Exchange and Protests are coeval with the 13th, century; and from the time of introducing a Protest to the present day, its only use has been to enable the drawer of the protested bill to take his funds out of the hands of the Drawee: but if no funds were in the hands of the drawee, then the fate of the bill must have been anticipated, no injury can be done to the drawer, and no notice will be necessary. It is true, that if the Drawee had failed with effects in his hands, between the time of the bills becoming due, and the time of protest, the Drawer would be discharged from any responsibility to the holder of the bills; but this fact, operating as a discharge, must be proved on the part of him, who wishes to take advantage of it; since prima facie, whatever may be the date of the protest, the drawer is responsible for the amount of the bills.<a class="footnote" href="#fn-s-3" id="fn-s-3_ref">*</a> Ld. Raymond 12 Mod. 15. Show. 317 Con. B. of E. 9. I Term Rep. 405. Dong. 55. 654. But, independent of this general principle, the bills were duly protested, in time and manner, according to the law of merchants; and as the Rhode Island act does not designate any particular process of protest, that law must have been contemplated as furnishing a rule to decide the question. It is manifest, then, from all the authorities as well as from the reason of the case, that in order to be duly protested according to the law of merchants, it is not necessary to be done within the three days of grace, or any other specific term. The usances on Bills of Exchange differ, in different countries; and the case in Showers' Reports p. proves that a bill may be duly protested even 30 days after it has become due, if the drawer does not show, that he has sustained some damage by the delay.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p17">
<span class="num">17</span>
<p class="indent">3rd. Error assigned. It may be thought by some to be a subject for regret, that Rhode Island has not discovered the superior merits of the systems resting on the English common law, or invented by the jurisprudential skill of her sister states: but, as it has so happened, it will not be disputed, that within her jurisdiction whatever is her law, and not what is the law of other countries or states, must furnish the rule for decision. On the cases in which there exists a necessity of employing writs of enquiry, the diversity of theory and practice has been great, at different periods of juridical history, and at different places, influenced by the principles of the British laws. In some of the States, writs of enquiry are executed on every occasion, even to fix a mere computation of interest, but in New England, and especially in Massachusetts and Rhode Island, a writ of enquiry never issues, but at the request of the parties, or by the discretion of the court, in whose presence it is invariably executed. No language can be more forcible to exclude the opposite construction, than the language of the Rhode Island act, which declares, 'that in all cases where judgment shall pass by default, etc. where damages are to be enquired into and assessed, it shall be done by the court, or otherwise, at their discretion.' The practice founded on this law, and co-eval with it in commencement, furnishes the best exposition. Thus, the judges assign a day after every term, to assess damages in defaulted cases; and, however preposterous it may be deemed by those who practice upon another plan, it is not the less true, that they constantly exercise the power of assessment in trover, in cases of special contract, and even in actions of slander. Suppose that the statute had said, in explicit terms, the court shall assess damages, and not a jury, could a writ of inquiry be issued? And if the Legislature could give the jurisdiction to the court, the uniform construction that they have given it, except where a writ of enquiry is awarded by their own discretion, or requested by a party, ought not to be arbitrarily rejected. Then, if the State Court had the power, the Circuit Court sitting in Rhode Island, also, possessed it; and, in their discretion, were bound either to exercise it themselves, or to refer it to a jury. Neither party asked for a writ of enquiry; but, in the words of the record, 'the cause being submitted to the court,'<a class="footnote" href="#fn-s-4" id="fn-s-4_ref">*</a> the court saw no more reason to issue a writ of enquiry to ascertain the damages specifically given by law, than to ascertain the interest at the legal rate; and after the judgment by default, nothing could be submitted to the court, but the damages. This, therefore, was the matter tried; and it sufficiently appears, without the aid of the excrescent nota bene. Besides, on this point, as well as on the point of discontinuance, the English authorities countenance the Rhode Island law and practice. Thus, on a demurrer in law, the justices may award damages for the party by their discretion, or award a writ to enquire of damages at their election. 7 Vin. Abr. p. 301. pl 4. Where judgment is by default, the court may give the damages, without putting the party to the trouble of a writ of enquiry. Ibid p. 308. pl. 22. The court may not only assess damages originally, but increase the damages previously assessed by a jury. Ib. p. 270. pl. 7. 9. It is the course of the court to give interest for damages upon a single bill, or bills of exchange, etc. and there needs no writ of enquiry. Ibid. p. 307. pl. 16. Nay, a writ of enquiry is considered, in some cases merely founding in damages, as a mere instrument to inform the conscience of the court, 'who, if they please (says Chief Justice Wilmot) may themselves assess the damages.' 3 Wils. 61. 2 Wils. 244. S. P. The modern cases, likewise, show the latitude to which the court extend this part of their jurisdiction; and it is the established practice to refer it to the Prothonotary, to ascertain damages and costs, and calculate interest on a promissory note, or bill of exchange, after judgment by default.

<p>Ingersoll and Dallas, for the Plaintiff in error. Lewis and E. Tilghman, for the Defendant in error.<sup>[*]</sup></p>
<p>The Plaintiff in error was a native of Massachusetts, formerly resident in Boston, where he contracted the debt in question to the Defendant in error, who was, also a native, and had always continued a resident, of that state. Some years afterwards the Plaintiff in error removed into Pennsylvania, became a resident citizen of the state, took the benefit of her bankrupt law (which, in its terms and operation, was analogous to the bankrupt laws of England) and duly obtained a certificate of conformity from the commissioners. Subsequent to this discharge, he returned, on a transient visit, to Boston; and, being there arrested by the Defendant in error, for the old debt, he caused the suit to be removed from the State into the Circuit Court, and pleaded his certificate in bar to the action: but the court (consisting of Judge IREDELL, and the District Judge) over-ruled the plea, and gave judgment for the Plaintiff below: whereupon the present writ of error was brought.<sup>[*]</sup></p>
<p>The argument of the case had been considerably advanced, when a contagious fever made its appearance again in Philadelphia, and the business of the court was unavoidably suspended. But at February Term, 1797, the court having decided, <span class="star-pagination">*370</span> in the case of Bingham versus Cabot, et al. that in order to sustain the jurisdiction of the Federal Court, it must be set forth in the process, that the parties are citizens of different states; and that form having been omitted in the present suit, this and several other writs of error were struck off the docket.</p>
<h2>NOTES</h2>
<p>[*]  It appeared, during the discussion, that a great diversity existed in the law and practice of the several States, upon this subject; and that a decision, directly contrary to that of the Circuit Court of Massachusetts, had been given in the Circuit Court of Rhode Island, composed a Judge Wilson and the District Judge.</p>
<p>[]  The following extract from Huberus was translated for, and read in, this cause; and, I am persuaded, that its insertion here will be approved by the prosession.
</p>
<p>HUBERUS, 2 Vol. B. 1. Tit. 3 ps 26. Â— "It often happens that contracts entered into in one place, take effect in different governments, or are judicially decided upon in other places, than those in which they were entered into.</p>
<p>It is also well known, that when the Roman Empire was destroyed, the Christian world was divided into many nations, not united under any common head, nor connected by any uniformity of regulations.</p>
<p>It is not wonderful that we do not find any thing upon this subject in the Roman law; when the government of the Roman people, was extended over a great part of the habitable globe, the frequent conflict and contrariety of laws could not occur; the rule was one and the same.</p>
<p>However the fundamental rules by which this question ought to be decided, appear to be derived from the Roman law, although the inquiry itself appears to belong rather to the law of nations, than to the civil law; as what different nations observe between themselves, it is obvious forms the law of nations.</p>
<p>In order to render this very intricate business plain and clear, we will lay down three maxims, which, being fully established, as it appears to us they may easily be, the deduction of the consequences, necessary to an entire understanding of the subject, will be of no great difficulty.</p>
<p>They are these: 1st. The laws of every empire have force within the limits of that government, and are obligatory upon all who are within its bounds.</p>
<p>2d. All persons within the limits of a government are considered as subjects, whether their residence is permanent or temporary.</p>
<p>3d. By the courtesy of nations, whatever laws are carried into execution, within the limits of any government, are considered as having the same effect every where, so far as they do not occasion a prejudice to the rights of the other governments, or their citizens.</p>
<p>It appears, therefore, upon this occasion, that we ought to consult, not the civil law only, but what is to be inserred from the mutual convenience, and the tacit consent of different people, because as the laws of one people cannot have any force or effect directly with another people, so, on the other hand, nothing would be more inconvenient in the promiscuous intercourse and practice of mankind, than that what was valid by the laws of one place, should be rendered of no effect elsewhere, by a diversity of law, which is the reason of the third maxim, of which heretofore no doubt appears to have been entertained.</p>
<p>With respect to the second maxim, some have thought otherwise, who deny that foreigners are subject to the law of the place.</p>
<p>I acknowledge there are exceptions to the rule, which I will notice hereafter; but this position we hold as most certain, that whoever live within the bounds of a government, are to be accounted its subjects. This is evident from considering the nature of a republic, and the universal custom among all nations, of controlling all those by their laws, who live among them, exemplified, as Grotius mentions, 2. c.u.n. 5. in the instance of personal arrest practised every where.</p>
<p>Whoever makes a contract in any particular place, is subjected to the laws of the place as a temporary citizen.</p>
<p>Nor indeed are they supported or justified by any reason, in compelling foreigners to abide by the decisions of the law where they happened to be, except on the general principle that the jurisdiction of a government is considered as competent to the control of all those, who are within its limits.</p>
<p>From these considerations the following position arises. All business and transactions in court, and out of court, whether testamentary or other conveyances, or acts, which are regularly done according the law of any particular place, are valid even where a different law prevails, and where, had they been so transacted, they would not have been valid. On the contrary, transactions and acts which are executed, contrary to the laws of a country, as they are void at first, never can be good and valid, and this applies, not only with respect to those who have their residence in the place of the contract; but those, who were there only occasionally; under this exception only, that if the rulers of another people would be affected by any peculiar inconvenience of an important nature, by giving this effect to transactions performed in another country, according to the laws of the place they are in, such particular place is not bound to give effect to those proceedings, or to consider them as valid within their jurisdiction. It is worth while to exemplify the principle by examples and instances.</p>
<p>In Holland a last will and testament may be made before a notary, and two witnesses: In Friezeland it is of no effect unless established and witnessed by seven witnesses.</p>
<p>A Batavian makes a will in Holland according to the law of the place, under which the goods, situated and found in Friezeland are demanded; ought the Judges of Friezeland to grant the demand founded upon the will made in Holland? The laws of Holland cannot bind the people of Friezeland, therefore to decide according to the first maxim, the will would not be good in Friezeland; but by the third maxim its validity is supported, and by that judgment is given in its favour. But a Frisian makes a journey into Holland, and there executes a will according to the law of the place, contrary to the law of Friezeland, and returns and dies there; Is the will good? it is good according to the second maxim; because while he was in Holland, though but for a temporary purpose, he was bound by the law of the place, and an act good, where done, ought to prevail every where, according to the third maxim, and that, without any distinction between moveable and immoveable estate, and so the law is practised. On the other hand, the Frizian makes his will in his own country, before a notary, with two witnesses, it is carried into Holland, and demand made of the goods found there: It will not be granted, because not made in a valid manner at first, being made contrary to the laws of the place. It would be the same thing if the Batavian, was to make such a will in Friezeland, although in Holland it would have been good; for it is true, that such a deed would not be good in its commencement, for the reasons just stated.</p>
<p>What we have said with respect to wills applies equally to conveyances to take effect during the life of the grantor: Provided a contract is made according to the law of the place, in which it is entered into, throughout in court, and out of court, even in those places where such a mode or contracting is not allowed, it will be supported. For example: In a certain place particular kinds of merchandize are prohibited, if sold there the contract is void Â— but if the same merchandize were sold elsewhere, in a place, where there was not any prohibition, and a suit is brought in a place where they were prohibited, the purchaser will be condemned and the suit maintained, because the contract was good in its origin, where made. But if the merchandize sold in another place, where they were prohibited, were delivered, the purchaser would not be condemned, because it would be contrary to the law and convenience of the government where they were sold, and an action would not be countenanced wherever instituted, even to compel the delivery; for, if on the delivery being made the purchaser would not pay the price, he would be bound, if at all, not by the contract, but that having got the goods of another, it would be unreasonable that he should enrich himself at the expence and loss of another.</p>
<p>The rule is equally applicable to adjudged cases. A sentence pronounced in any place, or a pardon granted by those who had jurisdiction, has equal effect every where. Nor is it lawful for the magistrates of another commonwealth, to prosecute, or suffer to be prosecuted, a second time, one who has been absolved or pardoned, although without a sufficient reason. Still however under this exception, that no evident danger or inconvenience result from it to the other commonwealth, as an instance within our own memory may exemplify. Titius having struck a man on the head, on the borders (within the limits) of Friezeland, who the following night discharged a great deal of blood at thenose, and, after having supped and drank heartily, died. Titius escaped into Transylvania. Being apprehended there as it appears voluntarily, he was tried and acquitted, upon the suggestion that the man did not die of the wound. This sentence was sent into Friezeland, and he applied for a discharge from the prosecution as having been acquitted. Â— Although the manner of trial was not very exceptionable, yet the court of Friezeland was much disgusted at the idea of excusing the delinquent, and giving effect to the foreign proceedings, although demanded by the Transylvanians; because the flight into the neighbouring government, and the pretended process appeared too evidently calculated to clude the jurisdiction of Friezeland; which is the exception under the third maxim. The same principle is observed in judgments respecting civil matters as is evident from the following example within our memory. A citizen of Harlem made a contract with one in Groningen and submitted himself to the Judges of Groningen. Being cited by virtue of this submission, and not appearing he was condemned, as contumacious. Execution of the sentence being demanded, it was doubted whether it ought to be granted in a Frizian court. The reason of doubting was, that by force of the submission, if he was not found in the foreign territory, they could not proceed against him as contumacious, as we shall fee elsewhere; not without prejudice to our jurisdiction and also of our citizens, could effect be given to such sentences. However it was allowed at that time, certain magistrates concurring, that it should not be permitted to the Frizians to examine by what principle the sentence passed at Groningen could be justified, but only whether it was valid according to the law of the place. Others were governed by the following reason, that the magistrate at Harlem on request had granted a citation which he ought rather not to have done, and the Amsterdam magistrate denies the execution of the sentence passed against the absent, being cited to the court of Friezeland by an edict founded on the terms of the submission and condemned without being heard; and that such proceedings ought not to affect any one. With this opinion I concur, on account of the restriction contained in the third axiom.</p>
<p>Again: It has been made a question, whether if a contract is entered into at any supposed place, abroad, and an action is commenced with us, and the rule was different here, and there, either in allowing or denying the action, which law is to govern? For instance. A Frizian becomes a debtor in Holland on account of merchandize sold there, and is sued in Friezeland after the expiration of two years; the act of limitation is pleaded which bars such actions with us after a lapse of two years; the creditor replies that in Holland, where the contract was made, such prescription and limitation do not exist; and therefore is not to be urged against him in this case. But it was otherwise decided once between justice Bleckenfeldt against G.Y. and again between John Jenollin against N.B. both before the great holidays in 1680. For the same reason, if a debtor resident in Friezeland executed an instrument in Holland before a magistrate which may there entitle him to an execution, but not by common right, no execution can issue here, but the merits of the original demand must be examined. The reason is, that acts of limitation, and modes of execution, do not belong to the essence of the contract, but to the time and manner of bringing suits, which is a distinct thing, and therefore, it is established upon the best ground, that in entering a judgment, the law of the place where it is rendered, is to govern, although, it respects a contract made elsewhere Â— Sandius B. 1. Tit. 12. Def. 5. where he says that in the execution of a sentence given abroad, the law of the place, in which the execution is asked, is to govern, not the law of the place, where the judgment was given.</p>
<p>The contract of matrimony is also regulated by the same rules. If it is regular and valid in that place where it was contracted and celebrated, it is binding every where, under the same exception of not doing prejudice to others Â— to which exception may be added, if incest should be permitted any where, or marriage in the second degree, which indeed is scarcely supposable.</p>
<p>In Friezeland matrimony is, when a man and woman agree to marry and voluntarily take each other for man and wife, although no ceremony is performed at church. In Holland, matrimony cannot be contracted in that manner. The Frizians, however, without doubt, enjoy among the Hollanders the rights of married people, in the particulars of dower, jointure, the rights of children to inherit the property of their parents, &amp;c.</p>
<p>In like manner if a Brabanter, who should marry under a dispensation from the Pope within the prohibited degrees, should remove here, the marriage would be considered as valid: yet if a Frizian marries the daughter of his brother in Brabant, and celebrates the nuptials there, returning here he would not be acknowledged as a married man, because, in this way our law might be cluded by bad examples, and this induces me to make an observation upon this point. It often happens, that young people desirous of forming improper connexions, and to sanction their illicit intercourse with the ceremony of marriage, go into East Friezeland, or other places, in which the consent of curators or guardians is not necessary to marriage, according to the Roman laws. There they celebrate marriage and presently return to their country Â— I think, that this is a manifest fraud or evasion of our law, and therefore that the magistrates here, are not obliged by the law of nations to acknowledge such marriages or to hold them as valid; especially with respect to those, who transfers and evade their own laws knowingly and intentionally. Moreover, not only, the contract of marriage itself, properly and regularly celebrated in one place, is good in all places, but the rights and incidents which attend it where celebrated, attend it elsewhere. In Holland married people have a communion of all their goods, unless it be otherwise expressly covenanted by them; this will be the effect, as to goods situated in Friezeland, although there marriage only occasions a common risque of profit and loss, not of the goods themselves; therefore the Frizians remain after the marriage each one, both husband and wife, separate owners of their goods situated in Holland. When however the married couple remove from the one state or province to the other, whatever is afterwards acquired or falls to either, is not in common, but held by distinct right, and what was before made common between them, will be either in common or otherwise as they direct: as Sandius lays it down who tells us, B. 2. de is tit. 5. def. 10. there was a dispute among the learned doctors whether immoveable goods, situated in another country, were to be affected and regulated by the rules as we have laid it down.</p>
<p>The reason of the doubt was, that the laws of one commonwealth, cannot affect the integral parts, the territory of another commonwealth; Â— to this two answers may be given. First, That it cannot be done by the immediate force and operation of a foreign law, but with the concurring consent of the supreme power in the other government, which gives an effect to foreign laws exercised upon property within its own jurisdiction, without any prejudice being received to its sovereignty or the rights of its citizens, regarding the mutual convenience of the two nations or governments, which is the foundation of all these rules. The other answer is, that it is not so much by force of law, as by the consent of the parties reciprocally communicating their rights to each other, by which means a change or modification of property may arise, not less from matrimony than any other contract.</p>
<p>The place, however, where the contract is entered into, is not to be exclusively considered: if the parties had in contemplation another place at the time of the contract, the laws of the latter, will be preferred in the construction of the contract.</p>
<p>Every one is considered as having contracted in that place, in which he bound himself to pay or perform any thing b. 21. de. O. &amp; A. and the place where matrimony is contracted is not so much the place where the ceremony is performed, as where they expect and intend to live and settle. It happens daily, that men in Friezeland, natives or sojourners, marry wives in Holland, which they immediately bring into Friezeland. And if at the time of the marriage, they intended immediately to settle in Friezeland, there will not in such case be a community of goods. Although they make no special marriage contract, not the law of Holland, but of Friezeland, will govern: the latter, not the former, is the place of their contract.</p>
<p>There is a further application of the restriction so often mentioned. The effects of a contract entered into at any place, will be allowed according to the law of that place, in other countries, if no inconvenience results therefrom to the citizens of that other country, with respect to the law which they demand, and the sovereignty of the latter place, is not bound, nor indeed can it so far extend the law of another territory. For example, the oldest and first hypothecation (mortgage) of a moveable, is to be preferred even against a third possessor, by the law of CÃ¦sar, and in Friezeland, not among the Batavians; therefore if any one upon such an Hypothecation proceeds to demand the article from a third person, he shall not be heard, but his suit rejected; because the right of the third person to that chattel, shall not be taken away, by the law of another jurisdiction or territory. Let us enlarge this rule to the following extent:</p>
<p>If the law of the place in another government is contrary to the law of our state, in which also a contract is made, inconsistent with a contract celebrated and made in another place, it is reasonable in such case, that we should observe our own law, rather than a foreign law. For example:</p>
<p>In Holland, matrimony is contracted with this agreement, that the wife shall not be responsible for the debts contracted by the husband only; although this is a private contract, it is said to be valid in Holland, to the prejudice of the creditors, with whom the husband shall afterwards contract debts, but in Friezeland such a kind of contract would not be binding unless published, nor would ignorance of the necessity of making it public, be an excuse according to the law of CÃ¦sar and equity. The husband contracts debts in Friezeland, and the wife is sued as jointly responsible, and liable for one half of the debt: She pleads her marriage contract Â— the creditors reply that this contract is contrary to the laws of Friezeland, because not published Â— and this is the rule with us, where the marriage was contracted here; as I lately gave my opinion when consulted upon the point. But those who contracted in Holland, and in whose favour the debts were contracted there, were non-suited, notwithstanding their suit was brought in Friezeland, because, as far as respected them, the law of the place, where the marriage was contracted, not the laws of the two countries, came into consideration.</p>
<p>From the rules laid down in the beginning, the following axiom may be deduced. Personal rights or disabilities obtained, or communicated, by the laws of any particular place, are of a nature which accompany, the person wherever he goes, with this effect, that in all places, he either enjoys the immunities or exemptions, or is subject to the disabilities imposed by the law of the country where, they at any time happen to be, on characters of that description</p>
<p>Therefore, those who with us are under tutors or curators as young men, prodigals, married women, are every where reputed, as persons subject to curators, and whatever the law of any place considers as the right or disabilities of persons of that description, they may suffer exercise and enjoy; hence, he who is excused the consequences of crimes, or contracts on account of his want of age, in Friezeland, cannot make binding contracts in Holland, and one declared, prodigal here, contracting elsewhere, will not be bound. Again, in some provinces, one above the age of twenty-one years, may convey his real estate; such a person may do the same in those places where twenty-five is the period of full age; because whatever the laws and judicial proceedings in any place, decide as to their subjects, other people allow to have the same effect with them, unless a prejudice or inconvenience, would result to them, or their laws.</p>
<p>There are persons who understand these personal rights to the following extent, that whoever, in a certain place, is of full age, or a minor, a child, or put out of the controul of the father, will enjoy the same rights, and be subject to the same disabilities, as in the place where he became such a character, or was so reputed; and whether the same thing would, or would not, have happened in his own country, still that the same consequence necessarily follows. It appears to me, that this is laying down the rule too broad, and would subject us to a burthensome inconvenience by the laws of our neighbours. An example will make the thing plain: A child not emancipated or exempted from the power of his Father, and who has nor ceased to be one of his family, cannot make a will in Friezeland. He goes into Holland, and there makes a will Â— is it valid? I think it valid in Holland, by the first and second rules, that the laws regulate as to all those within its limits, nor is it reasonable, that the people there, respecting a business done there, neglecting their own laws, should judge according to the laws of other people, but that will would not be valid in Friezeland, by the third rule, because by that means nothing would be more easy than to elude our laws, and our citizens might elude them every day. But in other places out of Friezeland, the will would be valid even where by their laws a child while one of the Father's family could not make a will, because there the reason would not apply, that their citizen had gone to Holland to elude their law in fiaudem legis.</p>
<p>The example I have given respects an act prohibited at home on account of a personal disability. Â— We will give another act allowed at home, but prohibited abroad, where done; Â— some time since decided in our Supreme Court Â— Rudolph Monsema aged 17 years and 14 days, was born, and lived at Groningen, after that he went abroad to learn the business of a Druggist, he made a will, which he might have made in Friezeland, but at Groningen, says D. Nauta the Reporter, it is not lawful for an infant to make a will under to, or in the time of his last illness, or for more than half his patrimony. The young man died of that sickness leaving his Father his heir, and leaving nothing to his Mother's relations, who contended that the will was void as made against the law of the place. The heirs insisted that a personal quality accompanies the person every where, and, as he could have made this will at home, he could make it abroad. But it was decided against the will, although there was no intention to a void the law, but the judgment was not universally approved Nauta himself dissenting. M S. 134. An. 1643. d. 27. Oct. Â—</p>
<p>The foundation of all this doctrine we have said, and we insist upon it, is the subjection that men owe to the laws of every country within which they are at any time; from whence it follows, that an act valid or void, in its beginning, and where it first takes place, must be the same elsewhere.</p>
<p>But this observation does not apply equally to immoveable property, since it is considered not as depending altogether upon the disposition of every maker or owner of a family Â— but the Commonwealth affixes certain rights as resulting from real property, and is interested in its disposal; nor could a nation without a great inconvenience suffer its real property to be conveyed with these incident rights, by the laws of another country, and contrary to its own laws Â— therefore a Frisian having fields and houses in the province of Groningen, cannot make a will disposing of them, because it is prohibited there to make a will of real estate; the Frisianlaw not affecting lands which constitute integral parts of a foreigu territory.</p>
<p>But this does not contradict the rule, that we have before laid down, that if a will is made accordingly to the ceremonies of the place, where the Testator resides, it will be good with respect to his property in another country, if a will could be made there, because the diversity of laws in that respect, does not affect the soil, but directs the manner of making the will, which, being rightly done, may pass real estate in another country, so far as may not interfere with any incidents, connected with the ownership of real property in the country where it is situated. This rule takes place in common conveyances Â— things annexed to the freehold in Friezeland, fold in Holland, in a manner prohibited in Friezeland, but allowed in Holland, are well fold Â— corn growing in Friezeland is sold in Holland according to the Lasts, as it is called, the sales are void, because it is prohibited in Freizeland, whether prohibited in Holland or not, because it is annexed to the freehold, and is a part of it.</p>
<p>The same rule held with regard to the succession to an intestate estate. Â— If the deceased was Father of a family, whose property was in different provinces, as far as respects the real estate, it would descend according to the laws of the place where situated; but with respect to the personal property, it would go according to the law of the place where the intestate lived, and of which he was an inhabitant Â— for which see Sandium lib. 4. Decis. Tit. 8. Def. 7.</p>
<p>These observations are of a nature that require more full explanation, seeing there are not wanting writers, who think otherwise in some particulars, whom you will see respectfully spoken of by Sandium in his reports of causes; to which add Rodenbergius treatise of laws, in the title of the Marriage Contract."</p>

<center><h1>FENEMORE, Plaintiff in Error,<br/>
versus<br/>
The UNITED STATES.</h1></center>
<center><p><b>Supreme Court of United States.</b></p></center>
<center></center>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*360</span> The cause was argued at the last term, upon an issue joined, after an assignment of the general errors, and the plea of in nullo est erratum, by Ingersoll and E. Tilghman, for the Plaintiff in error, and by Lee (the Attorney General) for the United States.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*363</span> On the 7th of August 1787, the Judges delivered their opinions to the following effect:</p>
<p>CHASE, Justice.</p>
<p>The judgment of the Circuit Court ought to be affirmed. Here is the case of a plain fraud. A man sets up a claim, exhibits colourable vouchers to support it, deceives the public officer, obtains a certificate that his claim is just, and, finally, converts that certificate into transferable stock. The transaction is rank from the beginning to the end; and the jury have properly found not only the fraud, but the value of the certificate obtained by it. The United States, by adopting the present mode of proceeding, have precluded themselves from ever disputing hereafter, the validity of the certificate; and they will never, perhaps, be able to indemnify themselves against the subsequent payments of interest, unless Fenemore remains solvent, and accessible to legal process. But, surely, it ought never to have been a subject of argument in a court of justice, whether, on stating a manifest fraud practised upon the public credit and treasury, the United States is entitled to recover an equivalent for the pecuniary injury, from the avowed delinquent.</p>
<p>IREDELL, Justice.</p>
<p>I am clearly of the same opinion. Upon strict technical rules, I had, at first, some doubts, whether the inconsistency of the counts in the declaration would not be fatal: but on the appearance of the rule entered into by consent, for the very purpose of obviating objections on that ground, my mind was perfectly satisfied. The only question, therefore, that remains to be decided, turns upon the right of the <span class="star-pagination">*364</span> United States, to affirm the original transaction; and, if they have that right, it follows, inevitably, that they ought to recover from the Defendant an equivalent for the value of the certificate, which was surreptitiously obtained. I have no difficulty in saying, that the right exists; and that, the public interest, involved in the credit of a public paper medium, required the exercise of the right in a case of this kind. The circulation of the certificate should be unimpaired; but the Defendant ought, at least, to be made responsible in his purse for the fraud. The defence is, indeed, an extraordinary one: it is an atempt to make the very act of fraud, an instrument, or shield, of protection. But, I trust, no man will ever be able to defend himself in an American court of justice upon the ground of his own turpitude. As, therefore, every exception to form has been obviated by consent, and as the special verdict finds every material fact to justify the judgment of the court below, I think that judgment ought to be affirmed.</p>
<p>CUSHING, Justice.</p>
<p>The cause is susceptible of little doubt. The United States had a right to affirm the original transaction, and to proceed, as they have done, for the recovery of the value of the certificate and the interest.</p>
<p>ELSWORTH, Chief Justice.</p>
<p>Giving a reasonable effect to the rule, which the parties themselves have entered into, all objection, as to the form and inconsistencies of the declaration, is obviated. Then, it is to be considered, that the United States had an option, either to affirm, or disaffirm, the original contract; and by the present action they have chosen to affirm it. The special verdict fairly authorised the court below to give judgment for the value of the certificate on the first and second counts, and for the amount of the money received as interest on the third count. With respect, however, to the right of disaffirmance, I with to be understood, as limiting it to the continuance of the certificate in the hands of the original party for, if the certificate had passed into the hands of a bona fide purchaser, even a court of equity would, I think, refuse to invalidate it; and, I am sure, public policy would forbid the attempt.</p>
<p>PATERSON, Justice.</p>
<p>As I joined in giving the judgment of the Circuit Court, it gives me pleasure to be relieved from the necessity of delivering any opinion on the present occasion. But, though I have no doubt on the case now to be decided, it appears to me to be another, and a great, question, how far a bill in equity would reach all the points involved in the original transaction.</p>
<p>Judgment Affirmed.</p>

<center><h1>BROWN Plaintiff in Error,<br/>
versus<br/>
BARRY.</h1></center>
<center><p><b>Supreme Court of United States.</b></p></center>
<center></center>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*366</span> From the judgment of the Circuit Court, the present writ of error was brought, a variety of exceptions were taken to the record, and after argument by Lee, Attorney General, for the Plaintiff in error, and by E. Tilghman, for the Defendant, the opinion of THE COURT was delivered by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, in the following terms.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*367</span> ELSWORTH, Chief Justice.</p>
<p>In delivering the opinion of the court, I shall briefly consider the exceptions to the record, in the order in which they have been proposed at the bar.</p>
<p>1. The first exception states, that the act of the Legislature of Virginia, passed in the year, 1748, on which the action is founded, as an action of debt, was not in force, when the bill of exchange was drawn, to wit, on the 11th of February 1793. The question is, whether two subsequent acts of the Legislature of that State, passed at a session in 1792 (namely, one of November, declaring the repeal of the act of 1748, and another of December, declaring a suspension of that repeal till October 1793) did in fact, repeal, and leave repealed, the said act of 1748? This, it is contended, must have been their effect, as ascertained and limited by two other statutes, namely, one of 1789, declaring, that the repeal of a repealing act shall not revive the act first repealed; the other of 1783, declaring, that statutes should take effect from the day, on which they in fact passed, unless another day was named. It must be taken, however, that the act of 1748, remained in force; and that, until after the bill was drawn, for the following reasons. 1. The act, suspending the repealing act of November 1792, is not within the act of 1789, which declares, that the repeal of a repealing act shall not revive the act first repeated. The suspension of an act for a limited time, is not a repeal of it: And the act of 1789, being in derogation of the common law, is to be taken strictly. 2. The repealing act, and the act suspending it, acts of the same session, are, according to the British construction of statutes, and the rule, which appears to have prevailed in Virginia, parts of the same act, and have effect from the same day: and, taken together as parts of the same act, they only amount to a provision, that a repeal of the act of 1748, should take place at a day then future. The act of 1785, declaring the commencement of acts to be from the day, on which they in fact pass, does not apply here; for, by the third section of the act of 1789, it is provided, that when a question shall arise, whether a law passed during any session changes, or repeals, a former law during the same session, which is the present case, the same construction shall be made, as if the act of 1785, had never been passed, that is, both acts being of the same session, shall have the same commencement, on the first day of the session. 3. The manifest intent of the suspending act was, that the act, repealed by the repealing act, should continue in force till a day then future, the first of October, 1793. It could have had no other intent. And the intention of the Legislature, when discovered, must prevail, any rule of construction declared by previous acts to the contrary notwithstanding. Thus, <span class="star-pagination">*368</span> the act of 1748, clearly was in force when the bill was drawn.</p>
<p>II. The second exception states, that there is no averment of a protest for non-acceptance of the bills.</p>
<p>This exception is invalid on two grounds. 1. It does not appear, that the bill was not accepted, so that there could have been such protest; and, if accepted, it would have been immaterial for the Plaintiff to shew, that it was so, as his right of action could in no measure depend on that fact. The silence of the declaration as to the question, whether the bill was accepted or not, does not vitiate it; the action being on a protest for non-payment. 2. As to bills drawn in the United States and payable in Europe, of which this is one; the custom of merchants in this country does not ordinarily require, to recover on a protest for non-payment, that a protest for non-acceptance should be produced, though the bills were not accepted. I say the custom of merchants in this country; for the custom of merchants somewhat varies in different countries, in order to accommodate itself to particular courses of business, or other local circumstances.</p>
<p>III. The third exception states, that the judgment is for too large a sum, the bill having been taken for sterling, when, by the act of 1775 it ought to have been taken for current money of Virginia. That act requires, that if the consideration of a bill be a pre-existing currency debt, or be current money paid at the time of the draft, the bill shall express the amount of the debt, or currency paid, which was the real consideration. And that on failure so to do, the bill, though it may be expressed for sterling, as in this case, shall be taken to be for current money. The bill is thus expressed, "For value received in "current money;" but it does not say how much. The jury, however, have, by their special verdict, ascertained, that the real consideration of the bill was an engagement to draw other sterling bills. Now it is clear, that the consideration in fact, though variant from the face of a bill, is regarded by the act, and must be sought for, to give the act effect. Upon inquiry the jury have found the consideration to be such as to take the case out of the statute. In this bill then, the words added to value received, viz. "in current money," were immaterial and without effect: And, therefore, the words in the declaration, as descriptive of the bills, might be disregarded by the jury and the court.</p>
<p>IV. The fourth exception states, that the action is for foreign money, and its value is not averred. The verdict cures this. The jury have found the value, their verdict being in dollars. The value of sterling money, here sued for, had been long ascertained in Virginia by statute, and was certain enough.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*369</span> V. The fifth exception states, that the declaration is in the debet, as well as the detinet, though for foreign money.</p>
<p>The reason of the rule, that debet for foreign money is ill, is the uncertainty of its value; and, therefore, both the answers given to the fourth, apply to this present, exception.</p>
<p>Let the judgment of the Circuit Court be affirmed.</p>

<p class="indent">The proposition being now adopted by the constitutional number of States, Lee Attorney-general, submitted this question to the Court, Whether the Amendment did, or did not, supersede all suits depending, as well as prevent the institution of new suits, against any one of the United States, by citizens of another State?</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p4">
<span class="num">4</span>
<p class="indent">W. Tilghman and Rawle, argued in the negative, contending, that the jurisdiction of the Court was unimpaired, in relation to all suits instituted, previously to the adoption of the amendment. They promised, that it would be a great hardship, that persons legally suing, should be deprived of a right of action, or be condemned to the payment of costs, by an amendment of the Constitution ex post facto; 4 Bac. Abr. 636 7. pl. 5. And that the jurisdiction binder, before regularly established, the amendment notwithstanding the words 'shall not be construed,' etc. must be considered, in fact, as introductory of a new system of judicial authority. There are, however, two objections to be discussed: 1st. The amendment has not been proposed in the form prescribed by the Constitution, and, therefore, it is void. Upon an inspection of the original roll, it appears that the amendment was never submitted to the President for his approbation. The Constitution declares that 'every order, resolution, or vote, to which the concurrence of the Senate and House of Representatives may be necessary (except on a question of adjournment) shall be presented to the President of the United States; and before the same shall take effect, shall be approved by him, or being disapproved by him, shall be repassed by two thirds of the Senate and House of Representatives, etc.' Art. 1. s.7. Now, the Constitution, likewise declares, that the concurrence of both Houses shall be necessary to a proposition for amendments. Art. 5. And it is no answer to the objection, to observe, that as two thirds of both Houses are required to originate the proposition, it would be nugatory to return it with the President's negative, to be repassed by the same number; since the reasons assigned for his disapprobation might be so satisfactory as to reduce the majority below the constitutional proportion. The concurrence of the President is required in matters of infinitely less importance; and whether on subjects of ordinary legislation, or of constitutional amendments, the expression is the same, and equally applies to the act of both Houses of Congress.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p5">
<span class="num">5</span>
<p class="indent">2nd. The second objection arises from the terms of the amendment itself. The words 'commenced or prosecuted,' are properly in the past time; but, it is clear, that they ought not to be so gramatically restricted; for, then, a citizen need only discontinue his present suit, and commence another, in order to give the court cognizance of the cause. To avoid this evident absurdity, the words must be construed to apply only to suits to be 'commenced and prosecuted.' The spirit of the constitution is opposed to every thing in the nature of an ex post facto law can be passed by the Legislature of any individual State. Ibid. s. 10. It is true, that an amendment to the Constitution cannot be controuled by those provisions; and if the words were explicit and positive, to produce the retrospective effect contended for, they must prevail. But the words are doubtful; and, therefore, they ought to be so construed, as to conform to the general principle of the Constitution.<a class="footnote" href="#fn-s" id="fn-s_ref">*</a> In 4 Bac. Abr. 650. pl.64. it is stated, that 'a statute shall never have an equitable construction, in order to overthrow an estate;' but, if the opposite doctrine prevails, it is obvious that many vested rights will be affected, many estates will be overthrown. For instance; Georgia has made and unmade grants of land, and to compel a resort to her courts, is, in effect, overthrowing the estate of the grantees. So, in the same book (p. 652.pl.91. 92.) it is said, that 'a statute ought to be so construed, that no man, who is innocent, be punished or endamaged;' and 'no statute shall be construed in such manner, as to be inconvenient or against reason:' whereas the proposed construction of the amendment would be highly injurious to innocent persons; and, driving them from the jurisdiction of this court saddled with costs, is against every principle of justice, reason, and convenience. Presuming, then, that there will be a disposition to support any rational exposition, which avoids such mischievous consequences, it is to be observed, that the words 'commenced and prosecuted' are sinonimous. There was no necessity for using the word 'commenced,' as it is implied and included in the word 'prosecuted;' and admitting this glossary, the amendment will only affect the future jurisdiction of the court. It may be said, however, that the word 'commenced' is used in relation to future suits, and that the word 'prosecuted' is applied to suits previously instituted. But it will be sufficient to answer, in favor of the benign construction, for which the Plaintiffs contend, that the word 'commencing' may, on this ground, be confined to actions originally instituted here, and the word 'prosecuted' to suits brought hither by writ of error, or appeal. For, it is to be shown, that a state may be sued originally, and yet not in the Supreme Court, though the Supreme Court will have an appellate jurisdiction; as where the laws of a state authorize such suits in her own courts, and there is drawn in question the validity of a treaty, or statute of, or authority exercised under, the United States, and the decision is against their validity. 1 Vol. p. 58. s.13. p. 63. s. 25. Upon the whole, the words of the amendment are ambiguous and obscure; but as they are susceptible of an interpretation, which will prevent the mischief of an ex post facto Constitution (worse than an ex post facto law, in as much as it is not so easily rescinded, or repealed) that interpretation ought to be preferred.</p>

<p class="indent">Lee, Attorney General. The case before the court, is that of a suit against a state, in which the Defendant has never entered an appearance: but the amendment is equally operative in all the cases against states, where there has been an appearance, or even where there have been a trial and judgment. An amendment of the constitution, and the repeal of a law, are not, manifestly, on the same footing: Nor can an explanatory law be expounded by foreign matter. The amendment, in the present instance, is merely explanatory, in substance, as well as language. From the moment those who gave the power to sue a state, revoked and annulled it, the power ceased to be a part of the constitution; and if it does not exist there, it cannot in any degree be found, or exercised, else where. The policy and rules, which in relation to ordinary acts of legislation, declare that no ex post facto law shall be passed, do not apply to the formation, or amendment, of a constitution. The people limit and restrain the power of the legislature, acting under a delegated authority; but they impose no restraint on themselves. They could have said by an amendment to the constitution, that no judicial authority should be exercised, in any case, under the United States; and, if they had said so, could a court be held, or a judge proceed, on any judicial business, past or future, from the moment of adopting the amendment? On general ground, then, it was in the power of the people to annihilate the whole, and the question is, whether they have annihilated a part, of the judicial authority of the United States? Two objections are made: 1st, That the amendment has not been proposed in due form. But has not the same course been pursued relative to all the other amendments, that have been adopted?<a class="footnote" href="#fn-s-1" id="fn-s-1_ref">*</a> And the case of amendments is evidently a substantive act, unconnected with the ordinary business of legislation, and not within the policy, or terms, of investing the President with a qualified negative on the acts and resolutions of Congress. 2nd, That the amendment itself only applies to future suits. But whatever force there may be in the rules for construing statutes, they cannot be applied to the present case. It was the policy of the people to cut off that branch of the judicial power, which had been supposed to authorize suits by individuals against states; and the words being so extended as to support that policy, will equally apply to the past and to the future. A law, however, cannot be denominated retrospective, or ex post facto, which merely changes the remedy, but does not affect the right: In all the states, in some form or other, a remedy is furnished for the fair claims of individuals against the respective governments. The amendment is paramount to all the laws of the union; and if any part of the judicial act is in opposition to it, that part must be expunged. There can be no amendment of the constitution, indeed, which may not, in some respect, be called ex post facto; but the moment it is adopted, the power that it gives, or takes away, begins to operate, or ceases to exist.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p7">
<span class="num">7</span>
<p class="indent">The Court, on the day succeeding the argument, delivered an unnanimous opinion, that the amendment being constitutionally adopted, there could not be exercised any jurisdiction, in any case, past or future, in which a state was sued by the citizens of another state, or by citizens, or subjects, of any foreign state.</p>

<p> Chase, Justice. The words 'commenced and prosecuted,' standing alone, would embrace cases both past and future.</p>
<p>W. Tilghman. But if the court can construe them, so as to confine their operation to future cases, they will do it, in order to avoid the effect of an ex post facto law, which is evidently contrary to the spirit of the constitution.</p>

<div class="footnote" id="fn-s-1">
<a class="footnote" href="#fn-s-1_ref">*</a>
<p> Chase, Justice. There can, surely, be no necessity to answer that argument. The negative of the President applies only to the ordinary cases of legislation: He has nothing to do with the proposition, or adoption, of amendments to the Constitution.</p>

<center><p><b>Supreme Court of United States.</b></p></center>
<center></center>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*402</span> In February term 1797, E. Tilghman, for the Defendant.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*404</span> ELSWORTH, Chief Justice.</p>
<p>There have been two exceptions taken to the record in the present case: 1. That the judgment of the inferior Court is so defective, that a Writ of Error will not lie upon it. It is evident, however, that the judgment is not merely interlocutory; but is in its nature final, and goes to the whole merits of the case. Though imperfect and informal, it is a judgment on which an execution could issue; and as the Defendant below might be thus injured by it, we are unanimously of opinion, that he is entitled to a Writ of Error.</p>
<p>2. The second exception is, that the judgment is not for a sum of sufficient magnitude to give jurisdiction to this Court. On this exception there exists a diversity of sentiment, but it is the prevailing opinion, that we are not to regard the verdict, or judgment, as the rule for ascertaining the value of the matter in dispute between the parties. By the judicial Statute, it is provided that certain decisions of the Circuit Courts, in certain <span class="star-pagination">*405</span> cases, may be reversed on a Writ of Error in the Supreme Court; but it is declared that the matter in dispute must exceed the sum or value of 2000 Dollars. To ascertain, then, the matter in dispute, we must recur to the foundation of the original controversy Â— to the matter in dispute when the action was instituted. The descriptive words of the law point emphatically to this criterion; and in common understanding the thing demanded (as in the present instance the penalty of a Bond) and not the thing found, constitutes the matter in dispute between the parties.</p>
<p>The construction, which is thus given, not only comports with every word in the law, but enables us to avoid an inconvenience, which would otherwise affect the impartial administration of justice. For, if the sum, or value, found by a verdict, was considered as the rule to ascertain the magnitude of the matter in dispute, then, whenever less than 2000 dollars was found, a Defendant could have no relief against the most erroneous and injurious judgment, though the Plaintiff would have a right to a removal and revision of the cause, his demand (which is alone to govern him) being for more than 2000 dollars. It is not to be presumed that the Legislature intended to give any party such an advantage over his antagonist; and it ought to be avoided, as it may be avoided, by the fair and reasonable interpretation, which has been pronounced.</p>
<p>IREDELL, Justice.</p>
<p>I differ from the opinion, which is entertained by a majority of the Court on the second exception; though, if the merits of the cause had been involved, I should have declined expressing my sentiments. As, however, the question is a general question of construction, and is of great importance, I think it a duty, briefly, to assign the reasons of my dissent.</p>
<p>The true motive for introducing the provision, which is under consideration, into the judicial act, is evident. When the Legislature allowed a Writ of Error to the Supreme Court, it was considered, that the Court was held permanently at the seat of the National Government, remote from many parts of the Union; and that it would be inconvenient and oppressive to bring suitors hither for objects of small importance. Hence, it was provided, that unless the matter in dispute exceeded the sum, or value, of 2000 dollars, a Writ of Error should not be issued. But the matter in dispute here meant, is the matter in dispute on the Writ of Error. In the original suit, indeed, I agree, that the demand of the party furnishes the rule of valuation; but the Writ of Error is of the nature of a new suit; and whatever may have been formerly the question on the merits, if we think the Plaintiff is not entitled to recover more than <span class="star-pagination">*406</span> 1800 dollars, the Court has not jurisdiction of a cause of such value, and cannot, of course, pronounce a judgment in it.</p>
<p>At common law, indeed, the penalty of the bond was alone regarded; and though, in a case like the present, only one shilling damages should be given by the Jury, the judgment at common law would be rendered for the whole penalty; so that the suffering party would be obliged to resort to a Court of Equity for relief. The Legislature, however, has deemed it expedient to guard against the mischief, and, at the same time, to prevent a circuity of action, by impowering the common law Courts to render judgment, in causes brought to recover the forfeiture annexed to any articles of agreement, covenant, bond, or other specialty, for so much as is due, according to equity. From the time of passing the act, the Plaintiff can recover no more under the penalty of the bond, than the damages assessed, or adjudged; and if a Court of common law is thus empowered to regard the matter in dispute, independent of the strict common law forfeiture of the penalty, this ought to be deemed, to every legal intent, the proper mode of settling and ascertaining the value, or amount, to which the words of the law shall be applied, in the case of a Writ of Error.</p>
<p>The objection, which seemed, principally, to operate against this doctrine, in the mind of the Court, as well as of the Bar, was its tendency to entitle one party to a Writ of Error, and to exclude the other: but the objection cannot arise in this case, as both parties would be alike estopped by the insufficiency of the sum. A new law, however, of a scope so extensive, cannot be expected to provide for every possible case; and it is no reason why a plain provision should not operate, that another provision may be necessary to avoid an inconvenience, or to establish equality between the parties.</p>
<p>I must, therefore, repeat my opinion, that although the Plaintiff's demand is to be regarded in the original action; yet, that the sum actually rendered by the Judgment, is to furnish the rule for fixing the matter in dispute upon a Writ of Error. And the sum actually rendered, being less than 2000 dollars, the Court cannot, I think, exercise a jurisdiction in the present cause.</p>
<p>CHASE, Justice.</p>
<p>On the first exception to this record, there is no diversity of opinion; and I, also, agree with the majority of the Court in the decision upon the second exception, though for reasons different from those that have been assigned.</p>
<p>This is a question of jurisdiction; and the law vests the jurisdiction, if the matter in dispute between the parties exceeds the sum, or value, of 2000 dollars. Whenever the objection arises on the amount of the matter in dispute, it is not, in my <span class="star-pagination">*407</span> opinion, to be settled here, by what appears on the Writ of Error, but it is to be settled in the inferior Court, according to the circumstances appearing there, in each particular case. There is no common, uniform, rule that can be applied to the subject. I do not think, that the demand of the Plaintiff ought to be made the sole criterion; for, then, every Plaintiff might entitle himself, in every case, to a Writ of Error, by laying his damages proportionally high: and I think that the amount rendered by the judgment would be found, in the far greater number of cases, to be the true rule. It must be acknowledged, however, that in actions of tort, or trespass, from the nature of the suits, the damages laid in the declaration, afford the only practicable test of the value of the controversy.</p>
<p>Enquiring, therefore, what was in dispute in the present case, we find, that the action was brought on a bond, with a condition for performing two acts, and the non-performance of both acts constitutes the breach assigned. The record is distorted by great irregularities; but every part of the pleadings, verdict, and judgment, that is not conformable to the common law, I reject as not belonging to the case, which is neither founded on the statute of 8 &amp; 9 W. 3. c. 10. nor on the act of the Assembly of Virginia. Considered, therefore, as an action at common law, the penalty is forfeited on the non-performance of either of the acts, which are the subject of the condition. The judgment of the Court is rendered for that penalty; and though it is stated, that the judgment shall be discharged, on payment of a smaller sum, such a stipulation is inconsistent with the nature of a common law judgment; it must be treated as mere surplusage; and in this view of the case, I am of opinion that the Court has jurisdiction.</p>
<p>ELSWORTH, Chief Justice.</p>
<p>I will repeat and explain one expression, which was used in delivering the opinion of the Court, and which seems to have been misunderstood.</p>
<p>It was not intended to say, that on every such question of jurisdiction, the demand of the Plaintiff is alone to be regarded; but that the value of the thing put in demand furnished the rule. The nature of the case must certainly guide the judgment of the Court; and whenever the law makes a rule, that rule must be pursued. Thus, in an action of debt on a bond for Â£100, the principal and interest are put in demand, and the Plaintiff can recover no more, though he may lay his damages at Â£10,000. The form of the action, therefore, gives in that case the legal rule. But in an action of trespass, or assault and battery, where the law prescribes no limitation as to the amount to be recovered, and the Plaintiff has a right to estimate his damages at any sum, the damage stated in the declaration is the thing put in <span class="star-pagination">*408</span> demand, and presents the only criterion, to which, from the nature of the action, we can resort in settling the question of jurisdiction.</p>
<p>The proposition then is simply this: Where the law gives no rule, the demand of the Plaintiff must furnish one; but where the law gives the rule, the legal cause of action, and not the Plaintiff's demand, must be regarded.</p>
<p>The objections over-ruled, and JUDGMENT affirmed.<sup>[*]</sup></p>
<h2>NOTES</h2>
<p>[*]  Besides the exceptions above stated, several errors were assigned, which had been argued at a former term, in the absence of the Chief Justice. The Court, after deciding the question of jurisdiction, called on the Counsel to proceed in the argument on those errors; but E. Tilghman observed, that the Court had been so evidently against him, that he would not press the subject further.</p>

<center><p><b>Supreme Court of United States.</b></p></center>
<center></center>
<p>CHASE, Justice.</p>
<p>The decision of one question determines (in my opinion) the present dispute. I shall, therefore, state from the record no more of the case, than I think necessary for the consideration of that question only.</p>
<p>The Legislature of Connecticut, on the 2d Thursday of May 1795, passed a resolution or law, which, for the reasons assigned, set aside a decree of the court of Probate for Harford, on the 21st of March 1793, which decree disapproved of the will of Normand Morrison (the grandson) made the 21st of August 1779, and refused to record the said will; and granted a new hearing by the said Court of Probate, with liberty of appeal therefrom, in six months. A new hearing was had, in virtue of this resolution, or law, before the said Court of Probate, who, on the 27th of July 1795, approved the said will, and ordered it to be recorded. At August 1795, appeal was then had to the superior court at Harford, who at February term 1796, affirmed the decree of the Court of Probate. Appeal was had to the Supreme Court of errors of Connecticut, who, in June 1796, adjudged, that there were no errors. More than 18 months elapsed from the decree of the Court of Probate (on the 1st of March 1793) and thereby Caleb Bull and wife were barred of all right <span class="star-pagination">*387</span> of appeal, by a statute of Connecticut. There was no law of that State whereby a new hearing, or trial, before the said Court of Probate might be obtained. Calder and wife claim the premises in question, in right of his wife, as heiress of N. Morrison, physician; Bull and wife claim under the will of N. Morrison, the grandson.</p>
<p>The Council for the Plaintiffs in error, contend, that the said resolution or law of the Legislature of Connecticut, granting a new bearing, in the above case, is an ex post facto law, prohibited by the Constitution of the United States; that any law of the Federal government, or of any of the State governments, contrary to the Constitution of the United States, is void; and that this court possesses the power to declare such law void.</p>
<p>It appears to me a self-evident proposition, that the several State Legislatures retain all the powers of legislation, delegated to them by the State Constitutions; which are not EXPRESSLY taken away by the Constitution of the United States. The establishing courts of justice, the appointment of Judges, and the making regulations for the administration of justice, within each State, according to its laws, on all subjects not entrusted to the Federal Government, appears to me to be the peculiar and exclusive province, and duty of the State Legislatures: All the powers delegated by the people of the United States to the Federal Government are defined, and NO CONSTRUCTIVE powers can be exercised by it, and all the powers that remain in the State Governments are indefinite; except only in the Constitution of Massachusetts.</p>
<p>The effect of the resolution or law of Connecticut, above stated, is to revise a decision of one of its Inferior Courts, called the Court of Probate for Harford, and to direct a new hearing of the case by the same Court of Probate, that passed the decree against the will of Normand Morrison. By the existing law of Connecticut a right to recover certain property had vested in Calder and wife (the appellants) in consequence of a decision of a court of justice, but, in virtue of a subsequent resolution or law, and the new bearing thereof, and the decision in consequence, this right to recover certain property was divested, and the right to the property declared to be in Bull and wife, the appellees. The sole enquiry is, whether this resolution or law of Connecticut, having such operation, is an ex post facto law, within the prohibition of the Federal Constitution?</p>
<p>Whether the Legislature of any of the States can revise and correct by law, a decision of any of its Courts of Justice, although not prohibited by the Constitution of the State, is a question of very great importance, and not necessary NOW to be determined; because the resolution or law in question does not go so far. I cannot subscribe to the amnipotence of a State <span class="star-pagination">*388</span> Legislature, or that it is absolute and without controul; although its authority should not be expressly restrained by the Constitution, or fundamental law, of the State. The people of the United States erected their Constitutions, or forms of government, to establish justice, to promote the general welfare, to secure the blessings of liberty; and to protect their persons and property from violence. The purposes for which men enter into society will determine the nature and terms of the social compact; and as they are the foundation of the legislative power, they will decide what are the proper objects of it: The nature, and ends of legislative power will limit the exercise of it. This fundamental principle flows from the very nature of our free Republican governments, that no man should be compelled to do what the laws do not require; nor to refrain from acts which the laws permit. There are acts which the Federal, or State, Legislature cannot do, without exceeding their authority. There are certain vital principles in our free Republican governments, which will determine and over-rule an apparent and flagrant abuse of legislative power; as to authorize manifest injustice by positive law; or to take away that security for personal liberty, or private property, for the protection whereof the government was established. An ACT of the Legislature (for I cannot call it a law) contrary to the great first principles of the social compact, cannot be considered a rightful exercise of legislative authority. The obligation of a law in governments established on express compact, and on republican principles, must be determined by the nature of the power, on which it is founded. A few instances will suffice to explain what I mean. A law that punished a citizen for an innocent action, or, in other words, for an act, which, when done, was in violation of no existing law; a law that destroys, or impairs, the lawful private contracts of citizens; a law that makes a man a Judge in his own cause; or a law that takes property from A. and gives it to B: It is against all reason and justice, for a people to entrust a Legislature with SUCH powers; and, therefore, it cannot be presumed that they have done it. The genius, the nature, and the spirit, of our State Governments, amount to a prohibition of such acts of legislation; and the general principles of law and reason forbid them. The Legislature may enjoin, permit, forbid, and punish; they may declare new crimes; and establish rules of conduct for all its citizens in future cases; they may command what is right, and prohibit what is wrong; but they cannot change innocence into guilt; or punish innocence as a crime; or violate the right of an antecedent lawful private contract; or the right of private property. To maintain that our Federal, or State, Legislature possesses such powers, if they had not been expressly restrained; would, <span class="star-pagination">*389</span> in my opinion, be a political heresy, altogether inadmissible in our free republican governments.</p>
<p>ALL the restrictions contained in the Constitution of the United States on the power of the State Legislatures, were provided in favour of the authority of the Federal Government. The prohibition against their making any ex post facto laws was introduced for greater caution, and very probably arose from the knowledge, that the Parliament of Great Britain claimed and exercised a power to pass such laws, under the denomination of bills of attainder, or bills of pains and penalties; the first inflicting capital, and the other less, punishment. These acts were legislative judgments; and an exercise of judicial power. Sometimes they respected the crime, by declaring acts to be treason, which were not treason, when committed;<sup>[*]</sup> at other times, they violated the rules of evidence (to supply a deficiency of legal proof) by admitting one witness, when the existing law required two; by receiving evidence without oath; or the oath of the wife against the husband; or other testimony, which the courts of justice would not admit;<sup>[Â†]</sup> at other times they inflicted punishments, where the party was not, by law, liable to any punishment;<sup>[Â‡]</sup> and in other cases, they inflicted greater punishment, than the law annexed to the offence.<sup>[Â†]</sup> Â— The ground for the exercise of such legislative power was this, that the safety of the kingdom depended on the death, or other punishment, of the offender: as if traitors, when discovered, could be so formidable, or the government so insecure! With very few exceptions, the advocates of such laws were stimulated by ambition, or personal resentment, and vindictive malice. To prevent such, and similar, acts of violence and injustice, I believe, the Federal and State Legislatures, were prohibited from passing any bill of attainder; or any ex post facto law.</p>
<p>The Constitution of the United States, article 1, section 9, prohibits the Legislature of the United States from passing any ex post facto law; and, in section 10, lays several restrictions on the authority of the Legislatures of the several states; and, among them, "that no state shall pass any ex post facto law."</p>
<p>It may be remembered, that the legislatures of several of the states, to wit, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, and North and South Carolina, are expressly prohibited, by their state Constitutions, from passing any ex post facto law.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*390</span> I shall endeavour to shew what law is to be considered an ex post facto law, within the words and meaning of the prohibition in the Federal Constitution. The prohibition, "that no state shall pass any ex post facto law," necessarily requires some explanation; for, naked and without explanation, it is unintelligible, and means nothing. Literally, it is only, that a law shall not be passed concerning, and after the fact, or thing done, or action committed. I would ask, what fact; of what nature, or kind; and by whom done? That Charles 1st. king of England, was beheaded; that Oliver Cromwell was Protector of England; that Louis 16th, late King of France, was guillotined; are all facts, that have happened; but it would be nonsense to suppose, that the States were prohibited from making any law after either of these events, and with reference thereto. The prohibition, in the letter, is not to pass any law concerning, and after the fact; but the plain and obvious meaning and intention of the prohibition is this; that the Legislatures of the several states, shall not pass laws, after a fact done by a subject, or citizen, which shall have relation to such fact, and shall punish him for having done it. The prohibition considered in this light, is an additional bulwark in favour of the personal security of the subject, to protect his person from punishment by legislative acts, having a retrospective operation. I do not think it was inserted to secure the citizen in his private rights, of either property, or contracts. The prohibitions not to make any thing but gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debts, and not to pass any law impairing the obligation of contracts, were inserted to secure private rights; but the restriction not to pass any ex post facto law, was to secure the person of the subject from injury, or punishment, in consequence of such law. If the prohibition against making ex post facto laws was intended to secure personal rights from being affected, or injured, by such laws, and the prohibition is sufficiently extensive for that object, the other restraints, I have enumerated, were unnecessary, and therefore improper; for both of them are retrospective.</p>
<p>I will state what laws I consider ex post facto laws, within the words and the intent of the prohibition. 1st. Every law that makes an action done before the passing of the law, and which was innocent when done, criminal; and punishes such action. 2d. Every law that aggravates a crime, or makes it greater than it was, when committed. 3d. Every law that changes the punishment, and inflicts a greater punishment, than the law annexed to the crime, when committed. 4th. Every law that alters the legal rules of evidence, and receives less, or different, testimony, than the law required at the time of the commission of the offence, in order to convict the offender. <span class="star-pagination">*391</span> All these, and similar laws, are manifestly unjust and oppressive. In my opinion, the true distinction is between ex post facto laws, and retrospective laws. Every ex post facto law must necessarily be retrospective; but every retrospective law is not an ex post facto law: The former, only, are prohibited. Every law that takes away, or impairs, rights vested, agreeably to existing laws, is retrospective, and is generally unjust, and may be oppressive; and it is a good general rule, that a law should have no retrospect: but there are cases in which laws may justly, and for the benefit of the community, and also of individuals, relate to a time antecedent to their commencement; as statutes of oblivion, or of pardon. They are certainly retrospective, and literally both concerning, and after, the facts committed. But I do not consider any law ex post facto, within the prohibition, that mollifies the rigor of the criminal law, but only those that create, or aggravate, the crime; or encrease the punishment, or change the rules of evidence, for the purpose of conviction. Every law that is to have an operation before the making thereof, as to commence at an antecedent time; or to save time from the statute of limitations; or to excuse acts which were unlawful, and before committed, and the like; is retrospective. But such laws may be proper or necessary, as the case may be. There is a great and apparent difference between making an UNLAWFUL act LAWFUL; and the making an innocent action criminal, and punishing it as a CRIME. The expressions "ex post facto laws," are technical, they had been in use long before the Revolution, and had acquired an appropriate meaning, by Legislators, Lawyers, and Authors. The celebrated and judicious Sir William Blackstone, in his commentaries, considers an ex post facto law precisely in the same light I have done. His opinion is confirmed by his successor, Mr. Wooddcson; and by the author of the Federalist, who I esteem superior to both, for his extensive and accurate knowledge of the true principles of Government.</p>
<p>I also rely greatly on the definition, or explanation of EX POST FACTO LAWS, as given by the Conventions of Massachusetts, Maryland, and North Carolina; in their several Constitutions, or forms of Government.</p>
<p>In the declaration of rights, by the convention of Massachusetts, part 1st. sect. 24, "Laws made to punish actions done before the existence of such laws, and which have not been declared CRIMES by preceeding laws, are unjust, &amp;c."</p>
<p>In the declaration of rights, by the convention of Maryland, art. 15th, "Retrospective laws punishing facts committed before the existence of such laws, and by them only declared criminal, are oppressive, &amp;c."</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*392</span> In the declaration of rights by the convention of North Carolina, art. 24th, I find the same definition, precisely in the same words, as in the Maryland constitution.</p>
<p>In the declaration of Rights by the convention of Delaware, art. 11th, the same definition was clearly intended, but inaccurately expressed; by saying "laws punishing offences (instead of actions, or facts) committed before the existence of such laws, are oppressive, &amp;c."</p>
<p>I am of opinion, that the fact, contemplated by the prohibition, and not to be affected by a subsequent law, was some fact to be done by a Citizen, or Subject.</p>
<p>In 2nd Lord Raymond 1352, Raymond, Justice, called the stat. 7 Geo. 1st. stat. 2 par 8, about registering Contracts for South Sea Stock, an ex post facto law; because it affected Contracts made before the statute.</p>
<p>In the present case, there is no fact done by Bull and wife Plaintiffs in Error, that is in any manner affected by the law or resolution of Connecticut: It does not concern, or relate to, any act done by them. The decree of the Court of Probate of Harford (on the 21st, March) in consequence of which Calder and wife claim a right to the property in question, was given before the said law or resolution, and in that sense, was affected and set aside by it; and in consequence of the law allowing a hearing and the decision in favor of the will, they have lost, what they would have been entitled to, if the Law or resolution, and the decision in consequence thereof, had not been made. The decree of the Court of probate is the only fact, on which the law or resolution operates. In my judgment the case of the Plaintiffs in Error, is not within the letter of the prohibition; and, for the reasons assigned, I am clearly of opinion, that it is not within the intention of the prohibition; and if within the intention, but out of the letter, I should not, therefore, consider myself justified to continue it within the prohibition, and therefore that the whole was void.</p>
<p>It was argued by the Counsel for the plaintiffs in error, that the Legislature of Connecticut had no constitutional power to make the resolution (or law) in question, granting a new hearing, &amp;c.</p>
<p>Without giving an opinion, at this time, whether this Court has jurisdiction to decide that any law made by Congress, contrary to the Constitution of the United States, is void; I am fully satisfied that this court has no jurisdiction to determine that any law of any state Legislature, contrary to the Constitution of such state, is void. Further, if this court had such jurisdiction, yet it does not appear to me, that the resolution (or law) in question, is contrary to the charter of Connecticut, or its constitution, which is said by counsel to be composed of its <span class="star-pagination">*393</span> acts of assembly, and usages, and customs. I should think, that the courts of Connecticut are the proper tribunals to decide, whether laws, contrary to the constitution thereof, are void. In the present case they have, both in the inferior and superior courts, determined that the Resolution (or law) in question was not contrary to either their state, or the federal, constitution.</p>
<p>To shew that the resolution was contrary to the constitution of the United States, it was contended that the words, ex post facto law, have a precise and accurate meaning, and convey but one idea to professional men, which is, "by matter of after fact; by something after the fact." And Co. Litt. 241. Fearnes Con. Rem. (Old Ed.) 175 and 203. Powell on Devises 113, 133. 134. were cited; and the table to Coke's Reports (by Wilson) title ex post facto, was referred to. There is no doubt that a man may be a trespasser from the beginning, by matter of after fact; as where an entry is given by law, and the party abuses it; or where the law gives a distress, and the party kills, or works, the distress.</p>
<p>I admit, an act unlawful in the beginning may, in some cases, become lawful by matter of after fact.</p>
<p>I also agree, that the words "ex post facto" have the meaning contended for, and no other, in the cases cited, and in all similar cases; where they are used unconnected with, and without relation to, Legislative acts, or laws.</p>
<p>There appears to me a manifest distinction between the case where one fact relates to, and affects, another fact, as where an after fact, by operation of law, makes a former fact, either lawful or unlawful; and the case where a law made after a fact done, is to operate on, and to affect, such fact. In the first case both the acts are done by private persons. In the second case the first act is done by a private person, and the second act is done by the legislature to affect the first act.</p>
<p>I believe that but one instance can be found in which a British judge called a statute, that affected contracts made before the statute, an ex post facto law; but the judges of Great Britain always considered penal statutes, that created crimes, or encreased the punishment of them, as ex post facto laws.</p>
<p>If the term ex post facto law is to be construed to include and to prohibit the enacting any law after a fact, it will greatly restrict the power of the federal and state legislatures; and the consequences of such a construction may not be foreseen.</p>
<p>If the prohibition to make no ex post facto law extends to all laws made after the fact, the two prohibitions, not to make anything but gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debts; and not to pass any law impairing the obligation of contracts, were improper and unnecessary.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*394</span> It was further urged, that if the provision does not extend to prohibit the making any law after a fact, then all choses in action; all lands by Devise; all personal property by bequest, or distribution; by Elegit; by execution; by judgments, particularly on torts; will be unprotected from the legislative power of the states; rights vested may be divested at the will and pleasure of the state legislatures; and, therefore, that the true construction and meaning of the prohibition is, that the states pass no law to deprive a citizen of any right vested in him by existing laws.</p>
<p>It is not to be presumed, that the federal or state legislatures will pass laws to deprive citizens of rights vested in them by existing laws; unless for the benefit of the whole community; and on making full satisfaction. The restraint against making any ex post facto laws was not considered, by the framers of the constitution, as extending to prohibit the depriving a citizen even of a vested right to property; or the provision, "that private property should not be taken for PUBLIC use, without just compensation," was unnecessary.</p>
<p>It seems to me, that the right of property, in its origin, could only arise from compact express, or implied, and I think it the better opinion, that the right, as well as the mode, or manner, of acquiring property, and of alienating or transferring, inheriting, or transmitting it, is conferred by society; is regulated by civil institution, and is always subject to the rules prescribed by positive law. When I say that a right is vested in a citizen, I mean, that he has the power to do certain actions; or to possess certain things, according to the law of the land.</p>
<p>If any one has a right to property such right is a perfect and exclusive right; but no one can have such right before he has acquired a better right to the property, than any other person in the world: a right, therefore, only to recover property cannot be called a perfect and exclusive right. I cannot agree, that a right to property vested in Calder and wife, in consequence of the decree (of the 21st. of March 1783) disapproving of the will of Morrison, the Grandson. If the will was valid, Mrs. Calder could have no right, as heiress of Morrison, the physician; but if the will was set aside, she had an undoubted title.</p>
<p>The resolution (or law) alone had no manner of effect on any right whatever vested in Calder and wife. The Resolution (or law) combined with the new hearing, and the decision, in virtue of it, took away their right to recover the property in question. But when combined they took away no right of property vested in Calder and wife; because the decree against the will (21st. March 1783) did not vest in or transfer any property to them.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*395</span> I am under a necessity to give a construction, or explanation of the words, "ex post facto law," because they have not any certain meaning attached to them. But I will not go farther than I feel myself bound to do; and if I ever exercise the jurisdiction I will not decide any law to be void, but in a very clear case.</p>
<p>I am of opinion, that the decree of the Supreme Court of Errors of Connecticut be affirmed, with costs.</p>
<p>PATERSON, Justice.</p>
<p>The Constitution of Connecticut is made up of usages, and it appears that its Legislature have, from the beginning, exercised the power of granting new trials. This has been uniformly the case till the year 1762, when this power was, by a legislative act, imparted to the superior and county courts. But the act does not remove or annihilate the pre-existing power of the Legislature, in this particular; it only communicates to other authorities a concurrence of jurisdiction, as to the awarding of new trials. And the fact is, that the Legislature have, in two instances, exercised this power since the passing of the law in 1762. They acted in a double capacity, as a house of legislation, with undefined authority, and also as a court of judicature in certain exigencies. Whether the latter arose from the indefinite nature of their legislative powers, or in some other way, it is not necessary to discuss. From the best information, however, which I have been able to collect on this subject, it appears, that the Legislature, or general court of Connecticut, originally possessed, and exercised all legislative, executive, and judicial authority; and that, from time to time, they distributed the two latter in such manner as they though proper; but without parting with the general superintending power, or the right of exercising the same, whenever they should judge it expedient. But be this as it may, it is sufficient for the present to observe, that they have on certain occasions, exercised judicial authority from the commencement of their civil polity. This usage makes up part of the Constitution of Connecticut, and we are bound to consider it as such, unless it be inconsistent with the Constitution of the United States. True it is, that the awarding of new trials falls properly within the province of the judiciary; but if the Legislature of Connecticut have been in the uninterrupted exercise of this authority, in certain cases, we must, in such cases, respect their decisions as flowing from a competent jurisdiction, or constitutional organ. And therefore we may, in the present instance, consider the Legislature of the state, as having acted in their customary judicial capacity. If so, there is an end of the question. For if the power, thus exercised, comes more properly within the description of a judicial than of a legislative power; and if by usage or the <span class="star-pagination">*396</span> Constitution, which, in Connecticut, are synonimous terms, the Legislature of that state acted in both capacities; then in the case now before us, it would be fair to consider the awarding of a new trial, as an act emanating from the judiciary side of the department. But as this view of the subject militates against the Plaintiffs in error, their counsel has contended for a reversal of the judgment, on the ground, that the awarding of a new trial, was the effect of a legislative act, and that it is unconstitutional, because an ex post facto law. For the sake of ascertaining the meaning of these terms, I will consider the resolution of the General court of Connecticut, as the exercise of a legislative and not a judicial authority. The question, then, which arises on the pleadings in this cause, is, whether the resolution of the Legislature of Connecticut, be an ex post facto law, within the meaning of the Constitution of the United States? I am of opinion, that it is not. The words, ex post facto, when applied to a law, have a technical meaning, and, in legal phraseology, refer to crimes, pains, and penalties. Judge Blackstone's description of the terms is clear and accurate. "There is, says he, a still more unreasonable method "than this, which is called making of laws, ex post facto, "when after an action, indifferent in itself, is committed, the "Legislator, then, for the first time, declares it to have been "a crime, and inflicts a punishment upon the person who has "committed it. Here it is impossible, that the party could "foresee that an action, innocent when it was done, should "be afterwards converted to guilt by a subsequent law; he "had, therefore, no cause to abstain from it; and all punishment "for not abstaining, must, of consequence, be cruel and "unjust." 1 Bl. Com. 46. Here the meaning, annexed to the terms ex post facto laws, unquestionably refers to crimes, and nothing else. The historic page abundantly evinces, that the power of passing such laws should be withheld from legislators; as it is a dangerous instrument in the hands of bold, unprincipled, aspiring, and party men, and has been two often used to effect the most detestable purposes.</p>
<p>On inspecting such of our state Constitutions, as take notice of laws made ex post facto, we shall find, that they are understood in the same sense.</p>
<p>The Constitution of Massachusetts, article 24th of the Declaration of rights:</p>
<p>"Laws made to punish for actions done before the existence of such laws, and which have not been declared crimes by preceding laws, are unjust, oppressive, and inconsistent with the fundamental principles of a free government."</p>
<p>The Constitution of Delaware, article 11th of the Declaration of Rights:</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*397</span> "That retrospective laws punishing offences committed be fore the existence of such laws, are oppressive and unjust, and ought not to be made."</p>
<p>The Constitution of Maryland, article 15th of the Declaration of Rights:</p>
<p>"That retrospective laws, punishing facts committed before the existence of such laws, and by them only declared criminal, are oppressive, unjust, and incompatible with liberty; wherefore no ex post facto law ought to be made."</p>
<p>The Constitution of North Carolina, article 24th of the Declaration of Rights:</p>
<p>"That retrospective laws, punishing facts committed before the existence of such laws, and by them only declared criminal, are oppressive, unjust, and incompatible with liberty; wherefore no ex post facto law ought to be made."</p>
<p>From the above passages it appears, that ex post facto laws have an appropriate signification; they extend to penal statutes, and no further; they are restricted in legal estimation to the creation, and, perhaps, enhancement of crimes, pains and penalties. The enhancement of a crime, or penalty, seems to come within the same mischief as the creation of a crime or penalty; and therefore they may be classed together.</p>
<p>Again, the words of the Constitution of the United States are, "That no State shall pass any bill of attainder, ex post "facto law, or law impairing the obligation of contracts." Article 1st. section 10.</p>
<p>Where is the necessity or use of the latter words, if a law impairing the obligation of contracts, be comprehended within the terms ex post facto law? It is obvious from the specification of contracts in the last member of the clause, that the framers of the Constitution, did not understand or use the words in the sense contended for on the part of the Plaintiffs in Error. They understood and used the words in their known and appropriate signification, as referring to crimes, pains, and penalties, and no further. The arrangement of the distinct members of this section, necessarily points to this meaning.</p>
<p>I had an ardent desire to have extended the provision in the Constitution to retrospective laws in general. There is neither policy nor safety in such laws; and, therefore, I have always had a strong aversion against them. It may, in general, be truly observed of retrospective laws of every description, that they neither accord with found legislation, nor the fundamental principles of the social compact. But on full consideration, I am convinced, that ex post facto laws must be limited in the manner already expressed; they must be taken in their technical, which is also their common and general, acceptation, and are not to be understood in their literal sense.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*398</span> IREDELL, Justice.</p>
<p>Though I concur in the general result of the opinions, which have been delivered, I cannot entirely adopt the reasons that are assigned upon the occasion.</p>
<p>From the best information to be collected, relative to the Constitution of Connecticut, it appears, that the Legislature of that State has been in the uniform, uninterrupted, habit of exercising a general superintending power over its courts of law, by granting new trials. It may, indeed, appear strange to some of us, that in any form, there should exist a power to grant, with respect to suits depending or adjudged, new rights of trial, new privileges of proceeding, not previously recognized and regulated by positive institutions; but such is the established usage of Connecticut, and it is obviously consistent with the general superintending authority of her Legislature Nor is it altogether without some sanction for a Legislature to act as a court of justice. In England, we know, that one branch of the Parliament, the house of Lords, not only exercises a judicial power in cases of impeachment, and for the trial of its own members, but as the court of dernier resort, takes cognizance of many suits at law, and in equity: And that in construction of law, the jurisdiction there exercised is by the King in full Parliament; which shews that, in its origin, the causes were probably heard before the whole Parliament. When Connecticut was settled, the right of empowering her Legislature to superintend the Courts of Justice, was, I presume, early assumed; and its expediency, as applied to the local circumstances and municipal policy of the State, is sanctioned by a long and uniform practice. The power, however, is judicial in its nature; and whenever it is exercised, as in the present instance, it is an exercise of judicial, not of legislative, authority.</p>
<p>But, let us, for a moment, suppose, that the resolution, granting a new trial, was a legislative act, it will by no means follow, that it is an act affected by the constitutional prohibition, that "no State shall pass any ex post facto law." I will endeavour to state the general principles, which influence me, on this point, succinctly and clearly, though I have not had an opportunity to reduce my opinion to writing.</p>
<p>If, then, a government, composed of Legislative, Executive and Judicial departments, were established, by a Constitution, which imposed no limits on the legislative power, the consequence would inevitably be, that whatever the legislative power chose to enact, would be lawfully enacted, and the judicial power could never interpose to pronounce it void. It is true, that some speculative jurists have held, that a legislative act against natural justice must, in itself, be void; but I cannot think that, under such a government, any Court of Justice would possess a power to declare it so. Sir William Blackstone, having put the strong case of an act of Parliament, which <span class="star-pagination">*399</span> authorise a man to try his own cause, explicitly adds, that even in that case, "there is no court that has power to defeat the intent of the Legislature, when couched in such evident and express words, as leave no doubt whether it was the intent of the Legislature, or no." 1 Bl. Com. 91.</p>
<p>In order, therefore, to guard against so great an evil, it has been the policy of all the American states, which have, individually, framed their state constitutions since the revolution, and of the people of the United States, when they framed the Federal Constitution, to define with precision the objects of the legislative power, and to restrain its exercise within marked and settled boundaries. If any act of Congress, or of the Legislature of a state, violates those constitutional provisions, it is unquestionably void; though, I admit, that as the authority to declare it void is of a delicate and awful nature, the Court will never resort to that authority, but in a clear and urgent case. If, on the other hand, the Legislature of the Union, or the Legislature of any member of the Union, shall pass a law, within the general scope of their constitutional power, the Court cannot pronounce it to be void, merely because it is, in their judgment, contrary to the principles of natural justice. The ideas of natural justice are regulated by no fixed standard: the ablest and the purest men have differed upon the subject; and all that the Court could properly say, in such an event, would be, that the Legislature (possessed of an equal right of opinion) had passed an act which, in the opinion of the judges, was inconsistent with the abstract principles of natural justice. There are then but two lights, in which the subject can be viewed: 1st. If the Legislature pursue the authority delegated to them, their acts are valid. 2d. If they transgress the boundaries of that authority, their acts are invalid. In the former case, they exercise the discretion vested in them by the people, to whom alone they are responsible for the faithful discharge of their trust: but in the latter case, they violate a fundamental law, which must be our guide, whenever we are called upon as judges to determine the validity of a legislative act.</p>
<p>Still, however, in the present instance, the act or resolution of the Legislature of Connecticut, cannot be regarded as an ex post facto law; for, the true construction of the prohibition extends to criminal, not to civil, cases. It is only in criminal cases, indeed, in which the danger to be guarded against, is greatly to be apprehended. The history of every country in Europe will furnish flagrant instances of tyranny exercised under the pretext of penal dispensations. Rival factions, in their efforts to crush each other, have superseded all the forms, and suppressed all the sentiments, of justice; while attainders, on the principle of retaliation and proscription, have marked all the <span class="star-pagination">*400</span> vicissitudes of party triumph. The temptation to such abuses of power is unfortunately too alluring for human virtue; and, therefore, the framers of the American Constitutions have wisely denied to the respective Legislatures, Federal as well as State, the possession of the power itself: They shall not pass any ex post facto law; or, in other words, they shall not inflict a punishment for any act, which was innocent at the time it was committed; nor increase the degree of punishment previously denounced for any specific offence.</p>
<p>The policy, the reason and humanity, of the prohibition, do not, I repeat, extend to civil cases, to cases that merely affect the private property of citizens. Some of the most necessary and important acts of Legislation are, on the contrary, founded upon the principle, that private rights must yield to public exigences. Highways are run through private grounds. Fortifications, Light-houses, and other public edifices, are necessarilly sometimes built upon the soil owned by individuals. In such, and similar cases, if the owners should refuse voluntarily to accommodate the public, they must be constrained, as far as the public necessities require; and justice is done, by allowing them a reasonable equivalent. Without the possession of this power the operations of Government would often be obstructed, and society itself would be endangered. It is not sufficient to urge, that the power may be abused, for, such is the nature of all power, Â— such is the tendency of every human institution: and, it might as fairly be said, that the power of taxation, which is only circumscribed by the discretion of the Body, in which it is vested, ought not to be granted, because the Legislature, disregarding its true objects, might, for visionary and useless projects, impose a tax to the amount of nineteen shillings in the pound. We must be content to limit power where we can, and where we cannot, consistently with its use, we must be content to repose a salutary confidence. It is our consolation that there never existed a Government, in ancient or modern times, more free from danger in this respect, than the Governments of America.</p>
<p>Upon the whole, though there cannot be a case, in which an ex post facto law in criminal matters is requisite, or justifiable (for Providence never can intend to promote the prosperity of any country by bad means) yet, in the present instance the objection doesnot arise: Because, 1st. if the act of the Legislature of Connecticut was a judicial act, it is not within the words of the Constitution; and 2d. even if it was a legislative act, it is not within the meaning of the prohibition.</p>
<p>CUSHING, Justice.</p>
<p>The case appears to me to be clear of all difficulty, taken either way. If the act is a judicial act, it is not touched by the Federal Constitution: and, if it is a legislegislative <span class="star-pagination">*401</span> act, it is maintained and justified by the ancient and uniform practice of the state of Connecticut.</p>

<center></center>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*412</span> The amended rule was argued, by Lewis and Hoffman (the Attorney-General of New-York.)</p>
<p>WASHINGTON, Justice.</p>
<p>The first question that occurs, from the arguments on the present occasion, respects the nature of the rights, that are contested in the suits, depending in the Circuit Court. Without entering into a critical examination of the Constitution and laws, in relation to the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, I lay down the following as a safe rule: That a case which belongs to the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, on account of the interest that a state has in the controversy, must be a case, in which a State is either nominally, or substantially, the party. It is not sufficient, that a State may be consequentially affected; for, in such case (as where the grants of different States are brought into litigation) the Circuit Court has clearly a jurisdiction. And this remark furnishes an answer to the suggestions, that have been founded on the remote interest of the State, in making retribution to her grantees, upon the event of an eviction.</p>
<p>It is not contended that the States are nominally the parties; nor do I think that they can be regarded as substantially, the parties, to the suits: nay, it appears to me, that they are not even interested, or affected. They have a right either to the soil, or to the jurisdiction. If they have the right of soil, they may contest it, at any time, in this Court, notwithstanding a decision in the present suits; and though they may have parted with the right of soil, still the right of jurisdiction is unimpaired. A decision, as to the former object, between individual Citizens, can never affect the right of the State, as to the latter object: it is res inter alios acia. For, suppose the Jury in some cases should find in favor of the title under New-York; and, in others, they should find in favor of the title under Connecticut, how would this decide the right of jurisdiction? And on what principle can private citizens, in the litigation of their private claims, be competent to investigate, determine, and fix, the important rights of sovereignty?</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*413</span> The question of jurisdiction remaining, therefore, unaffected by the proceedings in these suits, is there no other mode by which it may be tried? I will not say, that a State could sue at law for such an incorporeal right, as that of sovereignty and jurisdiction; but even if a Court of law would not afford a remedy, I can see no reason why a remedy should not be obtained in a Court of Equity. The State of New-York might, I think, file a bill against the State of Connecticut, praying to be quieted as to the boundaries of the disputed territory; and this Court, in order to effectuate justice, might appoint commissioners to ascertain and report those boundaries. There being no redress at law, would be a sufficient reason for the interposition of the equitable powers of the Court; since, it is monstrous to talk of existing rights, without applying correspondent remedies.</p>
<p>But as it is proposed to remove the suits under consideration from the Circuit Court into this Court, by writs of certiorari, I ask whether it has ever happened, in the course of judicial proceedings, that a certiorari has issued from a superior, to an inferior, court, to remove a cause merely from a defect of jurisdiction? I do not know that such a case could ever occur. If the State is really a party to the suit in the inferior Court, a plea to the jurisdiction may be there put in; or, perhaps, without such a plea, this Court would reverse the judgment on a writ of error: And if the State is not a party, there is no pretence for the removal.</p>
<p>A certiorari, however, can only issue, as original process, to remove a cause, and change the venue, when the Superior Court is satisfied, that a fair and impartial trial will not otherwise be obtained; and it is sometimes used, as auxiliary process, where, for instance, diminution of the record is alledged, on a writ of error: But in such cases, the Superior Court must have jurisdiction of the controversy. And as it does not appear to me, that this Court has exclusive, or original, jurisdiction of the suits in question, I am of opinion that the rule must be discharged.</p>
<p>PATERSON, Justice.</p>
<p>The rule to shew cause, why a venire should not be awarded to summon a jury from some district, other than that of Connecticut or New-York, cannot be supported. It has, indeed, been abandoned. The argument proceeds on the ground of removing the cause into this Court, as having exclusive jurisdiction of it, because it is a controver-versy between States. The constitution of the United States, and the act of Congress, although the phraseology be somewhat different, may be construed in perfect conformity with each other. The present is a controversy between individuals respecting their right or title to a particular tract of land, and <span class="star-pagination">*414</span> cannot be extended to third parties or states. Its decision will not affect the State of Connecticut or New-York; because neither of them is before the court, nor is it possible to bring either of them, as a party, before the Court, in the present action. The state, as such, is not before us. Besides, if the cause should be removed into this Court, it would answer no purpose; for I am not able to discern by what authority, we could change the venue, or direct a jury to be drawn from another District. As to this particular there is no divolution of power either by the constitution or law. The authority must be given; Â— we cannot usurp or take it.</p>
<p>If the point of jurisdiction be raised by the pleadings, the Circuit Court is competent to its decision; and, therefore, the cause cannot be removed into this Court previously to such decision. To remove a cause from one Court to another, on the allegation of the want of jurisdiction, is a novelty in judicial proceedings. Would not the certiorari to remove, be an admission of the jurisdiction below?</p>
<p>Neither of the motions is within the letter or spirit of the constitution or law.</p>
<p>How far a suit may, with effect, be instituted in this Court to decide the right of jurisdiction between two States, abstractedly from the right of soil, it is not necessary to determine. The question is a great one; but not before us.</p>
<p>I regret the incompetency of this Court to give the aid prayed for. No prejudice or passion, whether of a state or personal nature, should insinuate itself in the administration of justice. Jurymen, especially, should be above all prejudice, all passion, and all interest in the matter to be determined. But it is the duty of judges to declare, and not to make the law.</p>
<p>CUSHING, Justice.</p>
<p>These motions are to be determined, rather by the constitution and the laws made under it, than by any remote analogies drawn from English practice.</p>
<p>Both by the constitution and the judicial act, the Supreme Court has original jurisdiction, where a State is a party. In this case, the State does not appear to be a party, by any thing on the record. It is a controversy or suit between private citizens only; an action of ejectment, in which the defendant pleads to the jurisdiction, that the land lies in the State of New-York, and issue is taken on that fact.</p>
<p>Whether the land lies in New-York or Connecticut, does not appear to affect the right or title to the land in question. The right of jurisdiction and the right of soil may depend on very different words, charters, and foundations. A decision of that issue, can only determine the controversy as between the private citizens, who are parties to the suit, and the event, only <span class="star-pagination">*415</span> give the land to the Plaintiff or Defendant; but could have no controuling influence over the line of jurisdiction; with respect to which, if either State has a contest with the other, or with individuals, the State has its remedy, I suppose, under the constitution and the laws, by proper application, but not in this way; for she is not a party to the suits.</p>
<p>If an individual will put the event of his cause in a plea of this kind, on a fact, which is not essential to his right; I cannot think, it can prejudice the right of jurisdiction appertaining to a State.</p>
<p>I agree with the rest of the Court, that neither of the motions can be granted.</p>
<p>BY THE COURT: Let the rule be discharged.</p>

<p><span class="star-pagination">*419</span> The general errors being assigned, and issue being joined on the plea in nullo est erratum, the cause was argued by Lee, the Attorney General, Howell (of Rhode-Island) and Ingersoll, for the Plaintiff in error; and by E. Tilghman, Dexter (of Massachusetts) and Robbins (of Rhode-Island) for the Defendant in error.<sup>[*]</sup></p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*424</span> The opinion of the Court, after some days deliberation, was delivered by the Chief Justice, in the following terms.</p>
<p>ELLSWORTH, Chief Justice.</p>
<p>This cause comes up on a bill of exceptions, on the face of which three exceptions appear.</p>
<p>1. First, that bills of exchange, which had been non-accepted, and protested for non-payment, were admitted in evidence unaccompanied by protests for non-acceptance.</p>
<p>According to a general rule, laid down by this Court, in the case of Barry and Brown, from Virginia, and from which rule there appear no special circumstances to exempt the present case, this exception will not hold.</p>
<p>2. A further exception is, that the Judge in his charge to the Jury, held, that the two letters from the Defendants to the Plaintiff below, of the 20th and 21st of January 1796, which were set up to prove an undertaking, or guarrantee, might be explained by parol testimony; of which kind of testimony some had passed to the jury, without objection, but for what purpose does not now appear, as there were divers Counts, some of which parol testimony might have supported.</p>
<p>The undertaking declared upon, in the Count, to which the verdict applies, being for the duty of another, it must, to save it from the statute of frauds, and perjuries, be in writing, and wholly so. The two letters, therefore, which are relied upon as the written agreement, cannot be added to, or varied, by parol testimony. Nor can they be so far explained by parol testimony, as to affect their import, with regard to the supposed <span class="star-pagination">*425</span> undertaking. The charge then, of the Judge, that "they might be explained by parol testimony," expressed as a general rule, and without any qualifications, or restrictions, was too broad; and may have misled the jury. On this ground there must be a reversal.</p>
<p>3. It is, therefore, unnecessary to decide the remaining question Â— Whether the two letters did, of themselves, import an undertaking, or guarrantee? It may be proper to suggest, however, that a majority of the Court, at present, incline to the opinion that they do not.<sup>[*]</sup></p>
<p>Judgment reversed, and a Venire de novo awarded.</p>
<h2>NOTES</h2>
<p>[*]  ELLSWORTH, Chief Justice. On this point, I would wish to see any authorities that distinguish between solemn instruments, and loose commercial memoranda. There is seemingly a distinction in principle; though I do not recollect, that it is expressly recognized by any writer on the law. I will, for instance, state this case; Â— A and B being at a wharf, the former says to the latter, "I will sell you my ship John." B asks an hour to think of the proposition; goes home; and shortly after sends a note to A in these words Â— "I will take your ship John:" May not the party go beyond the note, to explain, by existing circumstances, the word take, which, according to existing circumstances, will equally embrace a purchase, a charter-party, and a capture? This exemplification will serve to convey my general idea; and it, evidently, includes many caes of daily occurrence in commercial transactions.</p>
<p>[]  On opening the case, Howell observed, that it was necessary, he presumed, to call on the Judge, who presided at the trial, to acknowledge his seal affixed to the bill of exceptions.
</p>
<p>ELLSWORTH, Chief Justice. The bill of exceptions is part of the record, and comes up with it. For that reason, the acknowledgment of the Judge's seal is unnecessary. But if the bill of exceptions had not been tacked to the record, such an acknowledgment might have been proper.</p>

IRVINE.</h1></center>
<center><p><b>Supreme Court of United States.</b></p></center>
<center></center>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*456</span> The CHIEF JUSTICE, on the last day of the term, delivered the opinion of the court as follows:</p>
<p>ELLSWORTH Chief Justice.</p>
<p>It appears that William Douglass, for services rendered, acquired under the King's Proclamation of 1763, a right to 5000 acres of unappropriated land in America; which right he assigned to Charles Sims, the lessor of the Plaintiff below. And although by the terms of the proclamation, the personal application of Douglass was requisite to obtain a land warrant on the said right, yet the laws of Virginia, passed subsequent to her independence, dispensed with such personal application, and made a warrant issuable to the assignee, Sims, he being an inhabitant of that state on the 3d of May, 1779. A warrant he accordingly obtained, and the same duly located on Montour's Island, the land in question; which his warrant was more than sufficient to cover, and which, from its description as an island, was perfectly aparted and distinguished from all other land. By which means Sims acquired to the said island a complete equitable title, and one which needed only a patent of confirmation to render it a complete legal title. A confirmation of this equitable title, as effectual as that of any patent could have been, was afterwards comprised in the compact between Virginia and Pennsylvania, and in the ratification of the same by the legislative act of the latter. The terms therein of "reserve and confirmation" of the "rights" which had been previously acquired under Virginia, in the territory thereby relinquished to Pennsylvania, must, from the nature of the transaction, be expounded favorably for those rights, and so that titles, before substantially good, should not <span class="star-pagination">*457</span> after a change of jurisdiction, be defeated or questioned for formal defects.</p>
<p>It further appears, that Sims, since the said compact and ratification, has, without any laches that would prejudice his claim, obtained a legal survey of the said land under Pennsylvania. In which state, payment, or as in this case consideration passed, and a survey though unaccompanied by a patent, give a legal right of entry, which is sufficient in ejectment. Why they have been adjudged to give such right, whether from a defect of Chancery powers, or for other reasons of policy or justice, is not now material. The right once having become an established legal right, and having incorporated itself as such, with property and tenures, it remains a legal right notwithstanding any new distribution of judicial powers, and must be regarded by the common law courts of the United States, in Pennsylvania, as a rule of decision.</p>
<p>The JUDGMENT of the Circuit Court affirmed.</p>
<p>IREDELL,<sup>[*]</sup> Justice.</p>
<p>Though I concur with the other Judges of the Court in affirming the Judgment of the Circuit Court, yet as I differ from them in the reasons for affirmance, I think it proper to state my opinion particularly.</p>
<p>In order to do this with the greater distinctness, it is necessary that I should observe upon the nature of this title according to my ideas of it, from its origin to what may be deemed its consummation, at least for the purpose of maintaining this ejectment.</p>
<p>My observations, therefore, will be under the following heads of inquiry:</p>
<p>1st. Whether it sufficiently appears that William Douglas was entitled to a military right, such as it was, under the Proclamation of 1763.</p>
<p>2d. Whether the right of Douglas, in case he was so entitled, was assignable, under the Royal Government, or since.</p>
<p>3d. Whether the Lessor of the Plaintiff in the ejectment, had a title, and if any, of what nature it was, under the laws of Virginia.</p>
<p>4th. Whether he had any title, subsequent to the compact, under the laws of Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>5th. Whether if he had a title, it was such as was sufficient to maintain this ejectment.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*458</span> The first question is,</p>
<p>1. Whether it sufficiently appears that William Douglas was entitled to a military right, such as it was, under the Proclamation of 1763?</p>
<p>Though the finding be not altogether so correct as it might have been, yet I think it may be fairly inferred that William Douglas had all the requisites to entitle him to a military right under that Proclamation, especially as the Jury have said generally that the King gave to him the right in question by that Proclamation, which could not have been in fact true had any of the requisites been wanting, and though a general finding inconsistent with a particular one cannot stand, yet I am of opinion a particular finding consistent with a general one may.</p>
<p>The next question is,</p>
<p>1. Whether the right of Douglas was assignable under the Royal Government, or since?</p>
<p>The grant was general to all who were the objects of it, and required only evidence of proper service, and the usual steps towards, obtaining a grant under any of the then Provinces. The Royal faith was pledged, that in such a case a grant should issue. It was immaterial, at that time, in what province the grant was obtained, as all belonged equally to the Crown. The grant was for meritorious services already performed, and therefore it was an interest, though in some degree indefinite in its nature, sanctioned by every principle of moral obligation, and such as the party entitled might, on the most solemn principles of public justice, confidently demand. Upon a large scale, the Crown was certainly a trustee for all those persons to whom its faith was pledged; and, therefore, so far as no particular prerogative of the Crown interfered, it was rational to consider it in the light of any other trust. It has been doubtful whether the Crown could in any case be a trustee, so as to be the object of any municipal decision, but the law could never presume (however the fact may be) that the Crown would not faithfully perform any trust belonging to it. The only difference between that and a private trust, is, that the latter is clearly enforcible by a Court of Equity; the former perhaps must be left to the conscience of the Crown itself. But this makes no difference in the nature of the interest. If this had been a private trust, it would at least have amounted to what in Equity is called a possibility, and it has been long settled that a possibility is assignable in Equity for a valuable consideration. I fee no reason why that principle cannot apply here. The necessity of a personal application was undoubtedly indispensible under the Royal government; but the two things are, in my opinion, perfectly compatible. Suppose such an assignment <span class="star-pagination">*459</span> had been made, a personal application was still necessary, and very probably for the judicious reasons assigned at the Bar; but after the grant, obtained on such personal application, if the interest had been fairly assigned before, the assignee would have been entitled to a conveyance. If none had been made, which would have been an acknowledgment of the fairness of the transaction, Chancery only could have been applied to, to compel a conveyance. The assignor or his heir would then have had to answer on oath, and an examination of all particulars might have been made, after which, if the Court had entertained the least doubt of the fairness of the transaction, they would not have ordered a conveyance. This would be a sufficient guard against fraud. But the assignment previous to an actual grant might have been necessary even to save an officer from starving. How hard would have been his condition, if he could have made no immediate use of a bounty of the Crown, expressly intended as a provision for him, but which circumstances might prevent his receiving for years?</p>
<p>Thus the case stood, as I conceive, under the Royal government. By the Revolution, the circumstances of it were, in some degree, changed, but not so as, in my opinion, materially to alter the nature of the title in this respect. The duty of the Crown, substantially, devolved on the several States, who became possessed of the territory formerly belonging wholly to the Crown; but as it might be an unreasonable thing to burden any one State with the whole of these provisions, some modification of the title might be expected so as to prevent this injury. This, however, does not seem to afford any reason why it should not remain an assignable interest, subject to the restriction I mentioned before, in case a personal application was still insisted upon, which it was undoubtedly optional in the States to require, or not. I therefore am of opinion, that the interest still remained assignable, subject only to such regulations as each State might think proper to require.</p>
<p>The next subject of enquiry is,</p>
<p>3d. Whether the Lessor of the Plaintiff in the ejectment had a title, and if any, of what nature it was, under the laws of Virginia?</p>
<p>I confess I have had great difficulty in construing the two Virginia acts, of May, and October, 1779, and if the latter act had admitted of such a construction that I could, without absurdity or manifest injustice have confined the words "or assigns" in that act, to mean only the heirs or assigns of those specially named in the former, I should undoubtedly have preferred that construction; because in the last act of May, 1779, the Virginia Legislature expressly designated the objects, for whom they <span class="star-pagination">*460</span> meant to provide; and whatever I might think of that provision (though I am far from thinking it an unjust one) I should deem it unwarranted to extend it to any others by construction of a subsequent law, without plain words of extension, unless there was an irresistible implication to authorise it. Such an implication, I think, exists here. The first act specifies the various objects of its provision: 1st. Those who had obtained a Warrant from the Governor of Virginia, under the former government. 2d. Where the service was performed by an inhabitant of Virginia. 3d. Where the service was performed in some regiment or corps actually raised in Virginia. The act of October, 1779 introduces a new provision for some persons of other, viz. a residence in Virginia at the passing of the former act (the 3d of May, 1779,) but they expressly except from the operation of this provision those who had obtained warrants under the former government, and those who had performed military service in some regiment or corps actually raised in Virginia, and had served under the circumstances particularly described in the act. They also except persons who had obtained a title under any former warrant. They do not, however, except in any manner one description of persons, who were provided for in the former law, viz. persons who were inhabitants of Virginia, and had performed military service in some other than Virginia regiment or corps, unless they or some persons claiming under them had previously obtained a warrant for it. But the act affords no indication from which we have a right to infer, that the Legislature meant to repeal any of the provisions in the former law; and if they did not, then upon the construction of the Council for the Plaintiff in Error, the provision, as to the persons I have last mentioned, in plain English would stand thus: "We are willing to reward the services "of any of the inhabitants of our own particular state, "when under the Royal government, by giving full effect to "the Royal proclamation, by which the faith of the former "government was pledged, provided the person, his heirs, or "assigns, actually resided in Virginia on the 3d of May, 1779. "But if such person moved out of this State before that day, or "died and left heirs or assigns, who either never resided in Virginia, "or did not actually reside thereon the auspicious 3d of "May, 1779, he, she, or they, shall receive nothing for such service." "Such a provision would undoubtedly be highly rediculous, for the grant under the proclamation was for services actually past, services of a highly meritorious nature, the risque of life, and sacrifice of private case, by entering into the army at a critical period, for the defence of their country; and to such persons certainly no additional merit could attach by a <span class="star-pagination">*461</span> residence in Virginia on the 3d of May, 1779. I therefore am compelled, upon principles of respect to the Legislature, to abandon this construction; and then there remains no other but to suppose, that they meant to provide by implication for a new description of persons (though under negative, informal, and incorrect words,) viz. persons who had fairly obtained titles under any military grant, though not of the special description before enumerated, if such person, his heirs, or assigns, actually resided in Virginia on the 3d of May 1779. Willing, in short, to confirm all fair purchases made by permanent, not occasional, residents in Virginia, (of which the residence at that time should be a test) when they might innocently have supposed, either that Virginia was bound to provide for all military rights presented, or would be disposed upon a large and liberal scale to do so, and had thus laid out their money from a kind of indefinite confidence in the future conduct of their own Legislature: And the word "hereafter" that has been commented upon (in the 3d section. of the act of the 3d. of May, 1779,) and the express saving in the act of October, 1779, of all titles under warrants formerly issued, independent of the saving of titles under warrants from the former government, seem strongly to favour this construction. By construing the act in this manner, though some difficulties yet remain, they are, in my opinion, fewer than upon the other construction; and as they are more consistent with equity, justice, and common sense, I deem it my duty as a Judge, to support the construction which will tolerate these, in preference to one which is attended with greater difficulties, and accompanied with absurdity and injustice: especially, as that construction will make both acts consistent in their main objects, and the other (without any indication from the apparent meaning of the Legislature) would amount to an express repeal of an important provision; and nearly in effect revoke a grant actually made, which, if within the competence of a Legislature, is undoubtedly one of the most odious acts of its power, and which nothing but absolute necessity should force us to say they intended.</p>
<p>The title, therefore, so far, under the laws of Virginia, I think was a vested right. But it seems to me now material to enquire, whether the title under the laws of Virginia was complete or incomplete. It is admitted, that a patent was regularly necessary to complete the title, even had a survey been made, and it is at least doubtful whether a warrant and survey would have given any legal right of possession at all. But in this case, it is contended, a survey was not necessary, for two reasons: I. Because the location of an island was certain, and the whole island would not exceed the quantity he was entitled to. <span class="star-pagination">*462</span> 2. Because no money was to have been paid upon it. These reasons do not satisfy me that a survey was unnecessary. A survey I consider in all instances to be highly useful, in order that it may be officially ascertained, and officially known, not only what land in particular is taken up, but also its exact quantity, so far as it is material to specify it, for the information of the public, from whom the grant is to be obtained, as well as that of any individual who may have interfering claims or pretensions. The private knowledge of a few particular persons who may know the spot thoroughly, is by no means equal to the authentic information which an actual survey, a regular report, and a correct record, can convey; and the instances are so very few, where exact information can otherwise be obtained, that there is no occasion for the sake of those to make an exception: It would do no good, and might lead to endless difficulties. I think, therefore, the necessity of a survey ought to be deemed general and indispensible, and there being none in this case previous to the compact made with Pennsylvania, the title so far was incomplete. But I admit, had a survey been unnecessary, and had such steps been taken in Virginia as would, of course, have intitled the Defendant in error to a patent, then the compact and the act of confirmation in consequence might have been deemed a complete and perfect assurance of it, and as effectual as if a patent had been actually granted before the compact under the laws of Virginia.</p>
<p>With respect to the payment of Â£.40. it is clear to me, that as that was meant as full purchase money for land, to which the person who entered had no right before, it never can apply to a case where the grant was for service already performed, unless the Legislature had wanted both common sense and common honesty. I have not hesitated a moment to reject that construction, the words in no manner requiring it, and easily admitting of the construction given by the counsel for the Defendant in error.</p>
<p>The finding in this case, I think, sufficiently establishes a relinquishment of the Indian title previous to the year 1779, so as to authorize an entry and location in the river Ohio, at the times the entry and location on behalf of the Defendant in error took place, without a violation of any duty either to a particular State or to the United States.</p>
<p>I come now to the next head of inquiry,</p>
<p>4. Whether the Defendant in error had any title, subsequent to the compact under the laws of Pennsylvania?</p>
<p>I do not consider that this compact, and the act in confirmation of it, immediately converted all inchoate and imperfect rights under Virginia into absolute and perfect ones under <span class="star-pagination">*463</span> Pennsylvania, but that the intention was, such as the title was under Virginia, it should substantially be under Pennsylvania, in preference to any younger right that might have been obtained in any manner under Pennsylvania. If the manner of proceeding on both sides was the same, then the Virginia claimant had nothing to do, but to proceed under the laws of the latter, as if his original title had been obtained from Pennsylvania. If the manner of proceeding in both States had been different, then I should have supposed it would have been proper for Pennsylvania to pass a new law adequate to this new case, that the faith of the State might have been duly observed. But I conceive under both States a survey was indispensible, the same reasons which I have urged on this subject, in considering the case of the Virginia right, applying equally to both States. The survey that was accordingly had under the State of Pennsylvania I think was a valid one, notwithstanding the objection as to the bed of the river, for as the law is general, (such at least it appears to me) that where two countries, or two counties, border on a navigable river, the middle of the bed of the river is the boundary line, I see nothing in this case to prove it an exception, and consequently the survey appears to have been made by the proper authority. With regard to the objection that in the 9th finding it is stated, that the Governor of Virginia transmitted in 1784 a just and true lift of entries made under the authority of Virginia in the disputed territory, in which list the island in question is not comprehended, and therefore the verdict impliedly excludes it, I answer, 1st, If the Governor had or had not transmitted a perfect list, this could not have deprived any party really entitled of shewing a title which had been omitted, either designedly (though that could not be presumed, but I state it as the strongest case) or inadvertently, on the part of the Governor, where at least an adverse claimant under Pennsylvania was not prejudiced by such omission, but had early and sufficient notice of the prior right, before he had completed his own. 2d. It may be a true list, so far as it goes, but not perfect for want of a complete knowledge of all particulars, some of which might have been omitted to be ascertained in the usual and proper manner. 3d. The implication in this case cannot have the effect contended for, because the 10th finding refers to that lift, as including the entry and location of the Defendant in error, and the 4th finding declares, that two Deputy Surveyors under the Surveyor General of Pennsylvania did in 1785 receive from the Surveyor General's office, a list of entries made under the authority of Virginia, which list included the entry for the land in the declaration mentioned.</p>
<p>The survey being in my opinion good, though it was subsequent <span class="star-pagination">*464</span> to the grant to the Plaintiff in error; shall be deemed to relate to the time of taking out the warrant, not only in consequence of the compact, which secured all prior rights of Virginia, and the act in confirmation of it, but also on account of the express saving of all prior rights in the grant to the Plaintiff in error by the commonwealth of Pennsylvania, who seem to have guarded with solicitude against any supposed breach of public faith, and therefore it is immaterial to enquire, what would have been the case had Pennsylvania expressly violated it. But where a Legislature has constitutional authority to pass any law, I can conceive a manifest distinction between right and power; between the obligation on the part of the Legislature, upon principles of morality, to give effect to a solemn compact, and their, in fact, making a law in violation of it, which it is the duty of the Courts to obey. The Legislature is restricted indeed in this particular by the constitution of the United States; and a treaty of the United States is, by its own authority, de facto, as well as morally, binding, while it continues in force, because it shall be the supreme law of the land. But until this constitution did pass, I should doubt very much, whether if the Legislature had actually violated the compact, the Court could here set up the compact against the law, upon principles which I have stated at large in my argument on the subject of the British debts, and to which I beg leave to refer, as it is now publishing in Mr. Dallas's Reports.<sup>[*]</sup> I say this only incidentally, on account of observations on this subject at the bar, in which I by no means acquiesce.</p>
<p>The warrant and survey being thus by me deemed complete and unexceptionable, under the commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the only remaining enquiry is,</p>
<p>5. Whether if the Defendant in error had a title, it was such as was sufficient to maintain this ejectment?</p>
<p>Two objections are stated under this head.</p>
<p>1. That the title, such as it is, is only an equitable, not a legal one, and therefore will not maintain an ejectment.</p>
<p>2. That it is not brought within proper time, but is barred by the Statute of limitations.</p>
<p>As to the first objection, did this title stand merely as an equitable one, I should strongly incline against it, if not deem it altogether insufficient. It is of infinite moment, in my opinion, that principles of law and equity should not be confounded, otherwise inextricable confusion will arise; neither will be properly understood; and instead of both being administered with useful guards, which the policy of each system has devised against abuse, an heterogeneous mass of principles, not intended to effort with each other, will be blended together, and the substance <span class="star-pagination">*465</span> of justice will soon follow the forms calculated to secure it. I totally reject all the modern cases introduced by Lord Mansfield, and supported by some other Judges, but lately, wisely, as I conceive, discountenanced by the present Court of King's Bench, of taking notice of a Cestui que trust at all in any other right than as holding in fact possession, with the concurrence of the legal Trustee. So far, consistent with legal principles, a Court may go, but not, as I conceive, one step further, and that it violates the most important principles of the common law to consider a Cestui que trust as having an iota of legal right against the Trustee himself. Whatever excuse a Court may have for doing this, when the want of a Court of equity may urge them to procure substantial justice, by a deviation from legal strictness as to form, I should hesitate long, before I should deem myself warranted in assenting to such a practice, when both powers are vested in the very same Court, but each has different modes of proceeding prescribed to it. But I think we are relieved from any dilemma of this kind, by strong and unequivocal declarations of highly respectable gentlemen of long experience in this State, that a warrant and survey, where no money remained to be paid, and a patent was only to ascertain that all previous requisites had been complied with, has been uniformly deemed a legal title, as opposed to an equitable one; and has all the consequences as such, even as to Dower, which affords a strong presumption in favor of the supposed legal title, for it has been so long held (though I think erroneously at first) that there should be no Dower of a trust estate, that perhaps no Judge would be warranted in a Court of Chancery in allowing it. Whether this opinion was originally right or not, yet having been the ground of many titles, it would be improper in the Court to shake it. I am not certain, also, but it may properly be considered, that the proprietor under a warrant and survey (according to long usage) is at least in the nature of a tenant at will to the public, and as such has a right of possession against all others, except some person having a better right, claiming under the public, which better right does not, for the reasons I have given, exist in this case, in the Plaintiff in error. This point, however, I merely intimate, it not being necessary to deliver an opinion upon it.</p>
<p>Another circumstance has occurred to me, which I suggest with diffidence, as it was not spoken to at the bar, that though the compact and confirming act did not render a survey unnecessary, yet when a survey was made, it being a right derived from compact alone, the title ought to stand on that ground alone, and not depend on a patent, which imports a grant by the <span class="star-pagination">*466</span> State, at its own discretion, of property of its own, and seems to imply that the State is the sole agent in the conveyance of the title.</p>
<p>With respect to the objection from the statute of limitations, it is sufficient to say, that that act, in my mind, clearly contemplates other objects, and neither in its letter, or spirit, is to be applied to this new and peculiar case; but admitting that it did, the facts in this case do not come within the provisions of it, there appearing to have been no such laches as the act contemplated to prevent.</p>
<h2>NOTES</h2>
<p>[*]  The CHIEF JUSTICE observed, at the conclusion of the opinion of the Court, that Judge IREDELL (whose indisposition prevented his attendance) concurred in the result, but for reasons, in some respects, different from those which had been assigned. As I have since been favored with a copy of Judge IREDELL's notes, I should think the report of the case imperfect without publishing them.</p>

<center></center>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*2</span> Hoffman, (the attorney-general of New-York) contended.</p>
<p>The opinion of the COURT was delivered by the Chief Justice.</p>
<p>ELLSWORTH, Chief Justice.</p>
<p>The prohibition contained in the statute, that writs of injunction shall not be granted, without reasonable notice to the adverse party, or his attorney, extends to injunctions granted by the Supreme Court, or the Circuit Court, as well to those that may be granted by a single Judge.</p>
<p>The design and effect, however, of injunctions, must render a shorter notice reasonable notice, in the case of an application to a Court, than would be so construed, in most cases of an application to a single Judge: and, until a general rule shall be settled, the particular circumstances of each case must also be regarded.</p>
<p>Circumstanced as the present case is, the notice, which has been given, is, in the opinion of the Court, sufficient, as it respects the parties against whom an injunction is prayed.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>
<span class="star-pagination">*3</span> The Same Cause.</h2>
<p>THE bill in this case contained an historical account of the title of New-York to the soil and jurisdiction of the tract of land in dispute; set forth an agreement of the 28th of November 1683, between the two states on the subject; and prayed a discovery, relief, and injunction to stay the proceedings in the Connecticut ejectments. 3 Dall. 411. As the state had not appeared, the question of injunction was the only one now argued.</p>
<p>Hoffman (the attorney-general of New-York), in support of the prayer for an injunction, and the general merits of the bill, urged various points, with great force and ability. 1st. It is necessary to execute the special agreement between the states. It is a principle of equity, that wherever there is an agreement, as to a right, whether it is a mere franchise, or a right of soil, it shall be enforced, and rendered conclusive upon the parties, by the interposition of the Court. The agreement admits that the tract of land belonged to New-York; and the bill states, that notwithstanding this admission, Connecticut has since undertaken to grant a part of it to the plaintiffs in the ejectments. Hence, it became necessary (or the bill would have been incomplete) to make those plaintiffs, parties to the present suit. The agreement, indeed, only gives the equitable title to New-York; while the plaintiffs below possess the legal title, and must, of course, recover in the ejectments. A specific performance of the agreement being decreed against Connecticut, would not be an adequate and complete remedy; and all parties in interest, however remote, must be brought before the court, or they cannot be affected by its proceedings. 2d. It will prevent a multiplicity of suits. The bill is emphatically a bill of peace; since, considering the character of the parties to the principal controversy, without this remedy, the consequences upon the public tranquillity can hardly be conjectured. It is true, however, that the right of the state of New-York cannot be affected by a decision in the Circuit Court; but till that right is lawfully settled, the number of suits, by individuals, must be indefinitely great; and merely to avoid a multiplicity of suits, to cut off, by one decision, various sources of strife and litigation, is a substantive ground for the exercise of a chancery jurisdiction. 1 Atk. 282. 2 Atk. 484. 3d. It is a bill for the discovery of title, which parties in interest, as well as parties in possession, may certainly maintain. 1 Vez. 249.<sup>[(1)]</sup> 4th. It is is a bill to <span class="star-pagination">*4</span> settle a question of boundary between two states. Of this question the Court can, incontestably, take cognizance; and it will not allow the decision of the principal matter to be interrupted, or prevented, by collateral considerations; particularly, when the decision of the principal, will settle all the inferior matters in disptue. In Penn v. Baltimore, 1 Vez. 454. the bill was sustained upon similar principles; and the jurisdiction there assumed upon principle, in a case of contested provincial boundary, may surely be exercised here under the additional sanction of the constitution. 2 Dall. 442. 415. 419. 3 Dall. 1. 412. But it is not simply a bill to settle a question of boundary between two states: it involves the right of soil, which, in relation to a great part of New-York, results from the right of jurisdiction; so that deciding the latter, is virtually a decision of the former. In this respect New-York is, perhaps, distinguished from her sister states, whose claims of territory are, generally, founded upon positive grant; while her claim of soil is a mere incident of the sovereignty and jurisdiction, with which the revolution invested her.<sup>[(2)]</sup></p>
<p>Ingersoll, against granting the prayer for an injunction. In the suits below, the state of New-York is not a party, and cannot be affected by their decision; while the defendants below are not parties to the present bill, though they are the persons most likely to be injured by those suits. But no part of the bill states, that any of the land belongs to New-York; so non constat that she is interested in the question of soil; and the question of state boundary cannot be decided, as between the states, in the Circuit Court.<sup>[(3)]</sup> There is no instance of the interposition of a court <span class="star-pagination">*5</span> of equity, by way of injunction, unless upon the application of a party immediately interested in the subject of the common law suits, or there is property likely to be withdrawn. 1 Ch. Prec. 186, 7. Gilb. Ch. 19. 2 Dall. 402. 5 Bot. Car. Canc. 439. Hind. Ch. 585. Besides, there is a regular course, in which the judgment of this court, independent of its equity character, may be obtained; as by a writ of error, on a demurrer to evidence, the construction and effect of the alleged agreement between the states, might here be revised, and authoritatively declared; and "suits in equity cannot be sustained in any Court of the United "States, in any case where plain, adequate, and complete remedy, "may be had at law:"<sup>[(4)]</sup> 1 vol. 59. s. 16. Cowp. 215, 6. 2 H. Black. 187. An eventual responsibility cannot constitute a party to the suits below. The several states should, in justice, refund the price of the confiscated estates, if those, who have now brought suits against the purchasers under their respective laws, should succeed; and Pennsylvania was bound, in honour, to compensate General Irwine, for the loss of Montour's island, on the failure of the title derived from her grant: 3 Dall. Rep. 425. but, surely, such considerations will not constitute parties to a judicial proceeding. As to a discovery of title, by whom, and against whom, is it sought? One party to the suit, does not require it from another; but a third person requires it, in a suit, to which he is not a party, and the decision in which cannot affect his right, whatever it may be.</p>
<p>Lewis, for the complainant, in reply. The difficulties of the case are obvious to all; and, unless the present remedy is applied, the difficulties will dangerously increase. If the lands are not in Connecticut, the ejectments are coram non judice. If they are not in New-York, suits there would be equally objectionable. Neither state will be satisfied, however, by the judgment of a Court held in the other; and for want of a peaceful forum to decide the controversy, an odious and vindictive litigation may be perpetuated. But this Court has a constitutional jurisdiction on a question of boundary between states; and, upon such an occasion, will be cager to exercise it. The interest of New-York, too, is sufficient to justify the exercise of it, upon her application. The right and possession of a sovereign state, are not to be treated like the usufructuary right, the possessio pedis, of a farmer. A sovereign state possesses what she governs. But is not New-York interested, even in a pecuniary point of view, so as to claim the interposition <span class="star-pagination">*6</span> of this Court, to which her settlers, the defendants below, cannot originally resort? It is a fundamental principle of the law of nature and of nations, that every government is bound to preserve peace and order, to protect individuals, to indemnify those who trust to its faith, and to prevent a dismemberment of its territory. This political and moral obligation, enforced by a regard to her public improvements, and fiscal operations, creates an interest of the highest character in the government of New-York; and such as the Court will cherish with all its benevolence and authority. 21 Vin. Abr. 181. pl. 1. Ibid. 183. pl. 4, 5. 7. Ibid. pl. 8. 11. 3 Black. Com. 255, 6.</p>
<p>The COURT, after advisement, delivered their opinion, that as the State of New-York was not a party to the suits below, nor interested in the decision of those suits, an injunction ought not to issue.</p>
<p>Injunction refused.<sup>[(5)]</sup></p>
<p></p>
<h2>The same Cause.</h2>
<p>AS the state of Connecticut did not appear, Hoffman moved that she should appear on the first day of next term, or that the plaintiff be then at liberty to proceed ex parte. 3 Dal. 335. But Lewis observed, that the rule required that a subpoena issuing in a suit in equity, should be served sixty days before the return; which had not been done in the present case. The first motion was, thereupon, waived; and an alias subpoena awarded. 3 Dall. 320.</p>
<h2>NOTES</h2>
<p>[(1)]  WASHINGTON, Justice. Â— Does the bill state, that the plaintiff is ignorant of the defendant's title?
</p>
<p>Hoffman. Yes, expressly.</p>
<p>WASHINGTON, Justice. Then you are aware, that if the injunction should be granted upon that ground, it must, of course, be dissolved, as soon as the discovery is obtained.</p>
<p>[(2)]  PATERSON, Justice. Generally speaking, the proposition is true, that, as to states, jurisdiction and the right of soil, go together.</p>
<p>[(3)]  ELLSWORTH, Chief Justice. If the bill contains no averment of a right of soil in New-York, I think it must be defective, and lays no foundation for an injunction. To have the benefit of the agreement between the states, the defendants below (who are the settlers of New-York) must apply to a court of equity as well as the state herself; but, in no case, can a specific performance be decreed, unless there is a substantial right of soil, not a mere political jurisdiction, to be protected and enforced. Besides, is not the bill, likewise, defective for want of making the defendants below parties to it?
</p>
<p>CHASE, Justice. The validity of the grant of either state must depend upon the question of boundary; for, neither New-York, nor Connecticut, could grant land, which it did not own. Hence, I think, the question of boundary must necessarily arise in the suits below.</p>
<p>PATERSON, Justice. On the question just proposed by the Chief Justice, it may be remarked, that some difficulty would occur in sustaining a bill in this court, at the suit of the defendants below. But it does not appear to me, that any of the cases in the books apply to the present case. What does the bill present? A case of disputed boundaries between two states; and the question of soil, on their conflicting grants, must be decided by the question of jurisdiction. The state of Connecticut has granted out the Gore. The state of New-York has, also, granted out the Gore. The grantees of Connecticut have brought suits in Connecticut against the grantees of New-York, and will obtain possession of the land. If the grantees of New-York are thus evicted, they will bring suits in New-York, and, in their possession. But where will this feud and litigation end? It is difficult and painful to conjecture, unless this Court can, under the constitution, lay hold of the case to decide the question of boundary, which will be a decision of all the appendages and consequences.</p>
<p>[(4)]  PATERSON, Justice. The rule was so before, and is so independent of the provision in the act of congress.</p>
<p>[(5)]  Hoffman. In every grant by New-York, there is a reservation of gold and silver mines, and of five acres per cent. for roads. The bill might, besides, be amended, by averring the state to be interested in a residuum of the land, if that would be sufficient to sustain the prayer for an injunction.
</p>
<p>WASHINGTON, Justice. The amendment would not satisfy me; for, my opinion is founded upon the fact, that New-York is not interested in the suits below.</p>
<p>CHASE, Justice. It is a mere bill to settle boundaries; and we must take it as we find it; not as it might be made.</p>
<p>ELLSWORTH, Chief Justice. If there had been a quorum of judges, without my attendance, I should have declined sitting in this cause. As it is, I am glad that the opinion of my brethren, dispenses with the necessity of my taking a part in the decision.</p>

<p class="parties">TURNER, administrator of Stanley, plaintiff in error,<br/>v.<br/>The President, Directors and Company of the BANK OF<br/>NORTH AMERICA, defendants.</p>
<p class="date">August Term, 1799.</p>
<div class="prelims">
<p>Jurisdictionâ€”Parties.</p>
<p class="indent">ERROR from the Circuit Court of North Carolina.  This was an action upon a promissory note, made in Philadelphia, by Stanley, the intestate, in favor of Biddle &amp; Co., and indorsed by Biddle &amp; Co. to the Bank of North America.</p>
<p class="indent">The declaration (which contained only a count upon the note itself) stated, that the president and directors of the bank were citizens of the state of Pennsylvania;  and that Turner, the administrator, and Stanley, the intstate, were citizens of the state of North Carolina;  but of Biddle &amp; Co., the payees and indorsers of the note, there was no other designation upon the record, than "that they used trade and merchandise in partnership together, at Philadelphia or North Carolina."</p>
<p class="indent">The error assigned and insisted upon, to wit, an insufficient description of Biddle &amp; Co., was founded on that part of the 11th section of the judicial act (1 U.S.Stat. 79) which declares, that no district or circuit court "shall have cognisance of any suit to recover the contents of any promissory note, or other chose in action, in favor of an assignee, unless a suit might have been prosecuted in such court, to recover the said contents, if no assignment had been made, except in cases of foreign bills of exchange."</p>
<p class="indent">Ingersoll, for the plaintiff in error, argued, that unless it was averred upon the record, that the original parties to the note, as well as the parties to the suit, were of different states, or one a citizen, and the other an alien, it could not judicially appear, that the circuit court had jurisdiction of the cause.  Though the federal courts are not to be regarded as inferior courts, they are courts of a limited jurisdiction.  The jurisdiction of the state courts is general;  but the jurisdiction of the federal courts is special, and in the nature of an exception from the general jurisdiction of the state courts.  That the parties are citizens of different states, is one ground for the exception;  and so far as respects the immediate parties to the suit, the ground for the exception sufficiently appears upon the record.  But if an action is brought by the indorsee of a promissory note, he cannot have the benefit of the exception, unless he shows that his indorser, as well as himself, was entitled to resort to a federal tribunal.  Congress knew, that the English courts have amplified their jurisdiction, through the medium of legal fictions;  and it was readily foreseen, that by the means of a colorable assignment to an alien, or to the citizen of another state, every controversy arising upon negotiable paper might be drawn into the federal courts.  Hence, the original character of the debt is declared to be the exclusive test of jurisdiction, in an action to recover it.  Unless the original character of the note furnished a subject of federal jurisdiction, it is emphatically declared, that "no district or circuit court shall have cognisance of the suit;"  and a court of special jurisdiction cannot take cognisance of the suit, unless the case judicially appears by the record to be within its jurisdiction. Lord Coningsby's Case, 9 Mod. 95.  So, wherever a party takes advantage of a clause in a statute, to which a proviso is attached, he must not only bring his case within the general clause, but show that it is not affected by the proviso.  5 Bac. Abr. 666;  Plowd. 410;  Ld. Raym.</p>
<p class="indent">Nor is the present too late a period to take advantage of the defect.  Silence, inadvertence of consent cannot give jurisdiction, where the law denies it.  In Bingham v. Cabot, 3 Dall. 382, the ground of jurisdiction was more strongly laid;  and yet a similar defect was successfully assigned for error.</p>
<p class="indent">Rawle, for the defendant in error.â€”It is not intended to controvert the general proposition, that where a suit is brought before an inferior court the circumstances that gave it jurisdiction must be set forth on the record;  and if they are omitted, it may be taken advantage of upon a writ or error.  But the circuit court is not, in technical language or intendment, an inferior court; and this consideration alone destroys the application of most of the English authorities.  It is, then, to be remarked, that the judicial power is the grant of the constitution;  and congress can no more limit, than enlarge the constitutional grant.  In the second section of the third article, the constitution contemplates the parties to the controversy is "between citizens of different states," the judicial power of the United States expressly extends to it.<a class="footnote" href="#fn(a)" id="fn(a)_ref">(a)</a>  By the opposite construction however, congress has imposed a limitation upon the judicial power, not warranted by the constitution, when, without regard to the immediate parties to the controversy, the law excepts from the cognisance of the federal courts, suits upon promissory notes, which, by assignment, have placed the immediate parties in the relation of citizens of different states.  If the circuit court is not an inferior, neither is it, in the sense asserted, a limited jurisdiction, but it is a court of general jurisdiction, having some cases expressly excepted from its cognisance.  It may be compared to the king's bench in England, from whose general jurisdiction is excepted the cognisance of cases, belonging to the counties Palatine.  Carth. 11, 12, 354;  1 Saund. 73;  2 Mod. 71-3.  As to such courts, it is sufficient, if it appears to the appellate authority, that, from the subject-matter, the court below might have jurisdiction;  and at all events, it would be too late, on a writ of error, to take the exceptionâ€”an objection not suggested in Bingham v. Cabot. Then, here, the parties are stated to be citizens of different states;  the place was not exempt from federal jurisdiction;  and the nature of the controversy did not, of itself, deprive the circuit court of its general cognisance of suits between citizens of different states.</p>

<p class="indent">CRASE, Justice.â€”The notion has frequently been entertained, that the federal courts derive their judicial power immediately from the constitution;  but the political truth is that the disposal of the judicial power (except in a few specified instances) belongs to congress.  If congress has given the power to this court, we possess it, not otherwise:  and if congress has not given the power to us, or to any other court, it still remains at the legislative disposal.  Besides, congress is not bound, and it would, perhaps, be inexpedient, to enlarge the jurisdiction of the federal courts, to every subject, in every form, which the constitution might warrant. are well described to be citizens of Pennsylvania, against Turner and others, who are well described to be citizens of North Carolina, upon a promissory note, made by the defendant, payable to Biddle &amp; Co., and which, by assignment, became the property of the plaintiffs.  Biddle &amp; Co., are no otherwise described, than as "using trade and merchandise in partnership together," at Philadelphia or North Carolina:  and judgment was for the plaintiff.  The error assigned, the only one insisted on, is, that it does not appear from the record, that Biddle &amp; Co., the promissees, or any of them, are citizens of a state other than that of North Carolina, or aliens.</p>

<p class="indent">A circuit court, though an inferior court, in the language of the constitution, is not so in the language of the common law; nor are its proceedings subject to the scrutiny of those narrow rules, which the caution or jealousy of the courts at Westminister long applied to courts of that denomination;  but are entitled to as liberal intendments or presumptions in favor of their regularity, as those of any supreme court.  A circuit court, however, is of limited jurisdiction:  and has cognisance, not of cases generally, but only of a few specially circumstanced, amounting to a small proportion of the cases which an unlimited jurisdiction would embrace.  And the fair presumption is (not as with regard to a court of general jurisdiction, that a cause is within its jurisdiction unless the contrary appears, but rather) that a cause is without its jurisdiction, until the contrary appears.  This renders it necessary, inasmuch as the proceedings of no court can be deemed valid, further than its jurisdiction appears, or can be presumed, to set forth upon the record of a circuit court, the facts or circumstances which give jurisdiction, either expressly, or in such manner as to render them certain by legal intendment.  Among those circumstances, it is necessary, where the defendant appears to be a citizen of one state, to show that the plaintiff is a citizen of some other state, or an alien; or if (as in the present case) the suit be upon a promissory note, by an assignee, to show that the original promisee is so:  for by a special provision of the statute, it is his description, as well as that of the assignee, which effectuages jurisdiction.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p5">
<span class="num">5</span>
<p class="indent">But here, the description given of the promisee only is, that "he used trade" at Philadelphia or North Carolina;  which, taking either place for that where he used trade, contains no averment that he was a citizen of a state, other than that of North Carolina, or an alien;  nor anything which, by legal intendment, can amount to such averment.  We must, therefore, say that there is error.  It is exceedingly to be regretted, that exceptions which might be taken in abatement, and often cured in a moment, should be reserved to the last stage of a suit, to destroy its fruits.</p>

<center><h1>Cooper<br/>
versus<br/>
Telfair.</h1></center>
<center><p><b>Supreme Court of United States.</b></p></center>
<center>February 13, 1800.</center>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*16</span> The case was argued by <i>E. Tilghman,</i> for the plaintiff, and by <i>Ingersoll</i> and <i>Dallas,</i> for the defendant.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*18</span> On the 13th of <i>February</i> 1800, the Judges (except the <i>Chief Justice,</i> who had decided the cause in the Circuit Court) delivered their opinions, <i>seriatim,</i> in substance as follows:</p>
<p>WASHINGTON, <i>Justice.</i></p>
<p>The constitution of <i>Georgia</i> does not expressly interdict the passing of an act of attainder and confiscation, by the authority of the legislature. Is such an act, then, so repugnant to any constitutional regulation, as to be excepted from the legislative jurisdiction, by a necessary implication? Where an offence is not committed within some county of the state, the constitution makes no provision for a trial, neither as to the place, nor as to the manner. Is such an offence (perhaps the most dangerous treason) to be considered as beyond the reach of the government, even to forfeit the property of the offender, within its territorial boundary? If the plaintiff in error had shown, that the offence, with which he was charged, had been committed in any county of <i>Georgia,</i> he might have raised the question of conflict and collision, between the constitution and the law: but as that fact does not appear, there is no ground on which I could be prepared to say, that the law is void. The presumption, indeed, must always be in favour of the validity of laws, if the contrary is not clearly demonstrated.</p>
<p>CHASE, <i>Justice.</i></p>
<p>I agree, for the reason which has been assigned, to affirm the judgment. Before the plaintiff in error could claim the benefit of a trial by jury, under the constitution, it was, at least, incumbent upon him to show, that the offence charged was committed in some county of <i>Georgia,</i> in which case alone the constitution provides for the trial. But even if he had established that fact, I should not have thought the law a violation of the constitution. The general principles contained in the constitution are not to be regarded as rules to fetter and controul; but as matter merely declaratory and directory: for, even in the constitution <span class="star-pagination">*19</span> itself, we may trace repeated departures from the theoretical doctrine, that the legislative, executive, and judicial powers, should be kept separate and distinct.</p>
<p>There is, likewise, a material difference between laws passed by the individual states, during the revolution, and laws passed subsequent to the organization of the federal constitution. Few of the revolutionary acts would stand the rigorous test now applied: and although it is alleged that all acts of the legislature, in direct opposition to the prohibitions of the constitution, would be void; yet, it still remains a question, where the power resides to declare it void? It is, indeed, a general opinion, it is expressly admitted by all this bar, and some of the Judges have, individually, in the Circuits, decided, that the Supreme Court can declare an act of congress to be unconstitutional, and, therefore, invalid; but there is no adjudication of the Supreme Court itself upon the point.<sup>[(1)]</sup> I concur, however, in the general sentiment, with reference to the period, when the existing constitution came into operation; but whether the power, under the existing constitution, can be employed to invalidate laws previously enacted, is a very different question, turning upon very different principles; and with respect to which I abstain from giving an opinion; since, on other ground, I am satisfied with the correctness of the judgment of the Circuit Court.</p>
<p>PATERSON, <i>Justice.</i></p>
<p>I consider it as a sound political proposition, that wherever the legislative power of a government is <i>undefined,</i> it includes the judicial and executive attributes. The legislative power of <i>Georgia,</i> though it is in some respects restricted and qualified, is not defined by the constitution of the state. Had, then, the legislature power to punish its citizens, who had joined the enemy, and could not be punished by the ordinary course of law? It is denied, because it would be an exercise of judicial authority. But the power of confiscation and banishment does not belong to the judicial authority, whose process could not reach the offenders: and yet, it is a power, that grows out of the very nature of the social compact, which must reside somewhere, and which is so inherent in the legislature, that it cannot be divested, or transferred, without an express provision of the constitution.</p>
<p>The constitutions of several of the other states of the union, contain the same general principles and restrictions; but it never was imagined, that they applied to a case like the present; and to authorise this Court to pronounce any law void, it must be a clear and unequivocal breach of the constitution, not a doubtful and argumentative implication.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*20</span> CUSHING, <i>Justice.</i></p>
<p>Although I am of opinion, that this Court has the same power, that a Court of the state of <i>Georgia</i> would possess, to declare the law void, I do not think that the occasion would warrant an exercise of the power. The right to confiscate and banish, in the case of an offending citizen, must belong to every government. It is not within the judicial power, as created and regulated by the constitution of <i>Georgia</i>: and it naturally, as well as tacitly, belongs to the legislature.</p>
<p>By the COURT:</p>
<p>Let the judgment be affirmed with costs.</p>

<p class="indent">THIS was a writ of error, to remove the proceedings on a bill in equity, from the Circuit Court, for the district of <i>Georgia</i>, tested the 27th <i>November</i> 1798, returnable on the next. The case, on the bill and pleadings, was, briefly, this:â€”<i>Alexander Willy</i>, an inhabitant of <i>Georgia</i>, being indebted to <i>Higginson</i> and <i>Greenwood, British</i> merchants, gave them a bond and mortgage, payable the first of <i>January</i> 1773. In the year 1778, <i>Willy</i> was banished from the state of <i>Georgia</i>, and his estate confiscated by law. The mortgaged premises were seized and sold by the commissioners for forfeited estates, to certain purchasers, who afterwards sold the same to <i>James Houston</i>; and the property remained in his possession, or in the possession of his executors, until the 12th of <i>September</i> 1796, when it was levied upon, sold, and conveyed to <i>William Mien</i>, by the creditors of <i>Houston</i>; notice of the mortgage having been given to <i>Mossman</i>, the executor of <i>Houston</i>, to <i>Mien</i>, the agent for his creditors, and to the marshal, before the sale. In <i>March</i> 1797, <i>Higginson</i>, the surviving mortgagee, filed the present bill to foreclose the equity of redemption, stating himself to be <i>a subject of Great Britain</i>; but in no part of the proceedings, were the defendants, or any of them, stated to be <i>citizens of the United States</i>. The defendants pleaded the confiscation laws of <i>Georgia</i> in bar, and answered to the merits; but WASHINGTON, <i>Justice</i>, over-ruled the pleas, and decreed, that unless <i>William Mien</i> paid the principal and interest of the debt, before the 17th of <i>February</i> 1799, the equity of redemption should be foreclosed. The merits of the decree were not, however, discussed on the writ of error, but the following points occurred:</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p2">
<span class="num">2</span>
<p class="indent">I. <i>Dallas</i>, for the plaintiff in error, moved to amend the writ, by inserting the return day of the present term in the blank. The writ is regularly tested, and by indorsements it appeared when it was filed below, and when it was filed here. The clerk of the Circuit Court had, also, indorsed, 'Returnable to <i>February</i> term 1799.' There is, therefore, sufficient matter to amend by; and the amendment is within the provision of the act of congress, 1 <i>vol.</i> 72. <i>s.</i> 32.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p3">
<span class="num">3</span>
<p class="indent">By the COURT. Let the amendment be made.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p4">

<p class="indent">II. It was objected by <i>Ingersoll</i> and <i>Dallas</i>, for the plaintiff in error, that the jurisdiction of the court, did not appear upon the record, as there was no designation of the citizenship of the defendants. 3 <i>Dall.

<p class="indent">It was answered by <i>E. Tilghman</i> and <i>Reed</i> (of <i>South-Carolina</i>) that as no process was prayed against <i>Willy</i>, he was not, in legal contemplation, a party to the suit; 1 <i>P. Wm.</i> 593. that the prayer of process against <i>Mossman</i>, who never held the land, was irregular, and to be regarded as mere surplusage; that there was no pretence to charge <i>Houston</i>; and that <i>Mien</i>, being expressly stated to be the purchaser of the land, the Court will take notice of the law of <i>Georgia</i>, by which no alien can hold real estate; and, by necessary implication, the purchaser must be a citizen. Besides, it is enough under the constitution, the treaty of 1783, and the 11th section of the judiciary act, that an alien is a party to the suit, whose real object is the thing mortgaged, a proceeding in <i>rem</i>, and not a personal recovery. At all events, the Court will permit the defect to be amended.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p6">
<span class="num">6</span>
<p class="indent"><i>Ingersoll</i>, in reply. The judiciary act was only intended to carry the constitution into effect, and cannot amplify, or alter, its provisions. The constitution no where gives jurisdiction (nor has any Judge ever countenanced the idea) in suits between alien and alien. It is not an exception to the rule, that the bill in equity, is in the nature of a proceeding <i>in rem:</i> for, there cannot be a foreclosure of the equity of redemption, without a personal suit. It is not like the case of a monition to condemn a prize ship, which is notice to all the world, and no party respondent is requisite; and the supposed inference of citizenship from purchasing land fails, when it is recollected, that the purchase does not fix the use. The jurisdiction of the federal Courts (<i>Const. art.</i> 3. <i>s.</i> 2.) is not where <i>a question</i> arises, that may be affected by a treaty, but where <i>a case</i> arises under a treaty; and if a question on the validity of a treaty, arises in a state Court, there is a special provision for transfering it to the Supreme Court; 1 <i>vol.</i> 61. <i>s.</i> 22. But, in the present instance, it does not appear that any question can arise under the treaty; for, it is not referred to, directly, nor indirectly, in any part of the record. As to an amendment, there is nothing to amend by. The citizenship of the defendants could only be judicially known, by the admission of the parties, or by evidence of the fact. It is not expressly, or impliedly admitted; and this Court cannot try an issue to ascertain it.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">By the COURT:</p>
<div class="num" id="p7">
<span class="num">7</span>
<p class="indent">The decisions, on this subject, govern the present case; and the 11th section of the judiciary act can, and must, receive a construction, consistent with the constitution. It says, it is true, in general terms, that the Circuit Court shall have cognizance of suits 'where an alien is <i>a party;</i>' but as the legislative power of conferring jurisdiction on the federal Courts, is, in this respect, confined to suits <i>between citizens and foreigners</i>, we must so expound the terms of the law, as to meet the case, 'where, indeed, an alien is one party,' but a citizen is the other. Neither the constitution, nor the act of congress, regard, on this point, the subject of the suit, but the parties. A description of the parties is, therefore, indispensable to the exercise of jurisdiction. There is here no such description; and, of course,</p>

In the particular case, before the Court, the facts call for the most liberal exposition in favour of the claimant; since, there is not the slightest ground to impute a fraudulent intention to him; nor could there be the smallest loss of revenue to the public. Taking, then, the 33d section of the same act of congress into view, to form a just conclusion from the whole, the watches in question are exempted from any forfeiture, because they did not belong to the master, owner, or mariners, of the vessel, in which they were imported, and because the duties upon them had been previously paid, or secured. (2) It must, indeed, be admitted, that there is an apparent contradiction between the 19th section, which imposes the forfeiture, if <i>the owner</i>, or consignee of the goods, neglects to perform the duties prescribed; and the 33d section, which exempts the goods from forfeiture, if they belong to any person, other than the owner, master, or mariners, of the vessel: but the different parts of statutes should be so construed, that each, if possible, may have an operation, consistent and harmonious with the rest. Admitting, therefore, that the claimant is within the description of the 19th section, to incur a forfeiture, the apparent contradiction of the law will be obviated, by admitting, also, that the previous payment of the duties on the goods, exempts him from the forfeiture, under the 33d section. Besides, the information does not state, that the master of the vessel had no manifest; and to constitute the offence the act of irregular transportation must be connected with the want of a manifest, conformably to the 18th section. The 19th section (and, indeed, the whole of the law, which is made emphatically to regulate <i>the coasting trade</i>) from the plain import of its language, applies to cases of water carriage, and cases of water carriage are equally the subject of the 33d section. Nor is there any thing in the case stated to show that the watches were not transported coast-wise; or brought in the owner's private carriage; and even the 19th section does not contain an injunction upon <i>the owner</i> to take out <i>a permit</i> for his goods, on which he has paid the duties, to whatever place he may choose to remove them.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>For the United States</i>. Though penal laws are to be strictly construed, they are to be fairly and truly construed, according to the plain and natural signification of the words employed. 2 <i>Ld. Raym.</i> 1421. 1 <i>Dall. Rep.</i> 197. 10 <i>Co.</i> 73. If, however, the claimant's construction should prevail, the sweeping operation of the 33d section of the act would annihilate its most positive and most salutary sanctions; but a proviso, so repugnant to the enacting clauses, would itself be void. 1 <i>Bl. Com.</i> 1 <i>Co. Rep.</i> 47. (a) The case stated brings the facts precisely within the information; and the information is precisely within the 19th section. The forfeiture is, therefore, complete, and must be enforced by the Court, unless it is remitted by the operation of the 33d section. It becomes important, then, to inquire, 1st. What is the true meaning of this ambiguous, and, certainly, ungrammatical clause? and, 2d. To what does the true meaning relate?</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p13">
<span class="num">13</span>
<p class="indent">1st. The first difficulty that occurs, in settling the meaning of the 33d section, arises from the indefinite call for a noun, to correspond with the verb, where several nouns are introduced, and all cannot be applied. Is it the <i>ship</i>, the <i>master</i>, or the <i>cargo</i>, which, in the specified case, '<i>shall</i> be exempted from any forfeiture?' The marginal note declares the exemption in favour of the <i>ship;</i> but the argument of the claimant, asks it for the <i>cargo</i>. The 33d section, however, is, in form and substance, <i>a proviso;</i> and, as such, naturally refers to the next preceding section, where are to be found the offences, from which the forfeiture springs, and the subject on which the forfeiture attaches; <i>s.</i> 32. to wit: 1st. The transfer of a licensed ship to an alien. 2d. The employment of a licensed vessel in a trade not licensed. 3d. The possession of a forged, or altered, licence. 4th. The possession of a licence granted for another ship. In the <i>four</i> cases, the ship and the targo on board, are declared to be the subject of forfeiture. But the exemption from forfeiture, contained in the 33d section, is not, in the generality of the expression, confined to the four cases; but extends to 'any forfeiture under this act, any thing 'therein contained to the contrary notwithstanding.' Must not <i>the nature</i> of the offence be considered, then, to qualify the generality of the expression? In the 5th section it is enacted, that if a vessel is found with a forged, or altered, licence; or makes use of a licence granted for another vessel, the offending vessel, and the cargo on board, shall be forfeited. In the 6th section it is enacted, that if a vessel is found in the coasting trade, or carrying on the fisheries, without being enrolled and licensed, and having a foreign cargo, or distilled spirits, on board, she and her lading shall be forfeited. In the 8th section it is enacted, that if an enrolled, or licensed, vessel sails on a foreign voyage without first surrendering her license, and taking out a register, she and her cargo shall be forfeited. And in the 21st section it is enacted, that if a vessel licensed for the fisheries, is found within three leagues of the coast, with foreign merchandize on board, exceeding in value 500 dollars, she and her cargo shall be forfeited, unless she had previously obtained permission to touch at a foreign port. Now, in all these sections the forfeiture of the cargo is accumulative, derivative, and accessary, to the forfeiture of the vessel; and the punishment is inflicted for offences committed by the master, or owner, of the vessel. Hence, the policy and justice of the provison of the 33d section, in contemplation of such cases, to prevent one man's suffering for another man's wrong, by exempting from forfeiture, the cargo on board the delinquent vessel, to whose owners, master, or mariners, the cargo did not belong. With reference, therefore, to the nature of the offences, enumerated in the next preceding section, the exemption from 'any forfeiture under this act,' must be confined to forfeitures of the same kind; that is, to forfeitures of vessels and their cargoes, for the acts, or omissions, of the owners, or masters, of the vessels. But, still, there are specific and appropriate forfeitures, arising from the misconduct of the owners of goods. Thus, if the owner of goods transport them, <i>by water</i>, from district to district, they must be accompanied with a manifest, or they will be liable to forfeiture, under the 18th section. And, if he transport them <i>by land</i>, he must obtain a permit, under the same penalty, in compliance with the 19th section. The same principle, which suggested the necessity of a manifest in the one case, required the permit in the other; and if the goods are not included in the manifest, or, of course, if not included in the permit, they are forfeited. It is idle to argue from the supposed inutility of requiring the permit. It is an incident in a general system, that must be maintained in all its parts; for, at the slightest aperture, the most inconvenient mischiefs may enter.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p14">
<span class="num">14</span>
<p class="indent">2d. In answering the second general inquiry (to what does the true meaning of the 33d section refer?) it is proper more particularly to observe, that the 19th section clearly provides for the case of a transportation <i>by land carriage;</i> because it speaks of a transportation '<i>across a state</i>,' which (as no canal is established) must be by land. If by land, it cannot involve the agency of a ship, or vessel; and as the proviso of the 33d section refers to the forfeiture of a ship, or vessel, and not of a waggon, or stage, as it does not describe <i>goods</i>, generally, but <i>a lading, or cargo, on board</i>, it is utterly inapplicable to a case of internal land carriage; and must be considered as referring only to cases of water transportation; or, in other words, to the coasting trade.</p>

<p class="indent">On the 15th of <i>August</i>, the Judges briefly delivered their opinions, <i>seriatim</i>, concurring in the following result.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">By the COURT:</p>
<div class="num" id="p16">
<span class="num">16</span>
<p class="indent">The case stated comes clearly within the 19th section of the act of congress, for enrolling and licensing vessels to be employed in the coasting trade and fisheries. The provisions of the section are salutary, and were made to guard against frauds upon the revenue, in the transportation of goods, of foreign growth, or manufacture, across the several states. Public policy, national purposes, and the regular operations of government, require, that the revenue system should be faithfully observed, and strictly executed. It is obvious that the claimant is an offender within the purview of the 19th section. To purge the offence, he relies upon the 33d section of the same act. But it is too plain for argument, that this section cannot, by any fair and rational construction, be made to refer to the 19th section. It is inapplicable, because the objects are entirely different.</p>

<p class="indent">Judgment affirmed.</p>
</div>
<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote">
<p>CHASE, <i>Justice</i>. By the rules, which are laid down in <i>England</i> for the construction of statutes, and the latitude which has been indulged in their application, the <i>British</i> Judges have assumed a legislative power; and on the pretence of judicial exposition, have, in fact, made a great portion of the statute law of the kingdom. Of those rules of construction, none can be more dangerous, than that, which distinguishing between the intent, and the words, of the legislature, declares, that a case not within the meaning of a statute, according to the opinion of the Judges, shall not be embraced in the operation of the statute, although it is clearly within the words: or, <i>vice versa</i>, that a case within the meaning, though not within the words, shall be embraced.</p>
<p>For my part, however, sitting in an <i>American</i> Court, I shall always deem it a duty to conform to the expressions of the legislature, to the letter of the statute, when free from ambiguity and doubt; without indulging a speculation, either upon the impolicy, or the hardship, of the law. In the present instance, the clause of forfeiture is clear, direct, and positive. If the provision of the 33d section were equally clear, and necessarily connected with the subject of the 19th section, it would, undoubtedly, control the clause of forfeiture. But say even, that the 33d section is obscure in its terms, and doubtful in its relation (which I do not admit) this would not induce me to supersede, control, and annul, what is neither obscure, nor doubtful, in the provisions of the 19th section.</p>
<p>Upon the whole, the effect, in the present case, will, probably, be severe upon the claimant, if he has only been guilty of an act of negligence: but the law does not distinguish, as to the present object, between a careless, and a fraudulent, omission of the duty prescribed, and the Court cannot do it.</p>

<center><h1>Bas, Plaintiff in Error,<br/>
versus<br/>
Tingy, Defendant in Error.</h1></center>
<center><p><b>Supreme Court of United States.</b></p></center>
<center></center>
<p>The case was argued by Lewis, and E. Tilghman, for the plaintiff in error, and by Rawle, and W. Tilghman, for the defendant.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*39</span> The JUDGES delivered their opinions seriatim in the following manner:</p>
<p>MOORE, Justice.</p>
<p>This case depends on the construction of the act, for the regulation of the navy. It is objected, indeed, that the act applies only to future wars; but its provisions are obviously applicable to the present situation of things, and there is nothing to prevent an immediate commencement of its operation.</p>
<p>It is, however, more particularly urged, that the word "enemy" cannot be applied to the French; because the section in which it is used, is confined to such a state of war, as would authorise a re-capture of property belonging to a nation in amity with the United States, and such a state of war, it is said, does not exist between America and France. A number of books have been cited to furnish a glossary on the word enemy; yet, our situation is so extraordinary, that I doubt whether a parallel case can be traced in the history of nations. But, if words are the representatives of ideas, let me ask, by what other word the idea of the relative situation of America and France could be communicated, than by that of hostility, or war? And how can the characters of the parties engaged in hostility or war, be otherwise described than by the denomination of enemies? It is for the honour and dignity of both nations, therefore, that they should be called enemies; for, it is by that description alone, that either could justify or excuse, the scene of bloodshed, depredation and confiscation, which has unhappily occurred; and, surely, congress could only employ the language of the act of June 13, 1798, towards a nation whom she considered as an enemy.</p>
<p>Nor does it follow, that the act of March 1799, is to have no operation, because all the cases in which it might operate, are not in existence at the time of passing it. During the present hostilities, it affects the case of re-captured property belonging to our own citizens, and in the event of a future war it might also be applied to the case of re-captured property belonging to a nation in amity with the United States. But it is further to be remarked, that all the expressions of the act may be satisfied, even at this very time: for by former laws the re-capture of property, belonging to persons resident within the United States is authorised; those residents may be aliens; and, if they are subjects of a nation in amity with the United States, they answer completely the description of the law.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*40</span> The only remaining objection, offered on behalf of the plaintiff in error, supposes, that, because there are no repealing or negative words, the last law must be confined to future cases, in order to have a subject for the first law to regulate. But if two laws are inconsistent, (as, in my judgment, the laws in question are) the latter is a virtual repeal of the former, without any express declaration on the subject.</p>
<p>On these grounds, I am clearly of opinion, that the decree of the Circuit Court ought to be affirmed.</p>
<p>WASHINGTON, Justice.</p>
<p>It is admitted, on all hands, that the defendant in error is entitled to some compensation; but the plaintiff in error contends, that the compensation should be regulated by the act of the 28th June 1798, (4 vol. p. 154. s. 2.) which allows only one-eighth for salvage; while the defendant in error refers his claim to the act of the 2d March, (ibid. 456. s. 7.) which makes an allowance of one-half, upon a re-capture from the enemy, after an adverse possession of ninety-six hours.</p>
<p>If the defendant's claim is well founded, it follows, that the latter law must virtually have worked a repeal of the former; but this has been denied, for a variety of reasons:</p>
<p>1st. Because the former law relates to re-captures from the French, and the latter law relates to re-captures from the enemy; and, it is said, that "the enemy" is not descriptive of France, or of her armed vessels, according to the correct and technical understanding of the word.</p>
<p>The decision of this question must depend upon another; which is, whether, at the time of passing the act of congress of the 2d of March 1799, there subsisted a state of war between the two nations? It may, I believe, be safely laid down, that every contention by force between two nations, in external matters, under the authority of their respective governments, is not only war, but public war. If it be declared in form, it is called solemn, and is of the perfect kind; because one whole nation is at war with another whole nation; and all the members of the nation declaring war, are authorised to commit hostilities against all the members of the other, in every place, and under every circumstance. In such a war all the members act under a general authority, and all the rights and consequences of war attach to their condition.</p>
<p>But hostilities may subsist between two nations more confined in its nature and extent; being limited as to places, persons, and things; and this is more properly termed imperfect war; because not solemn, and because those who are authorised to commit hostilities, act under special authority, and can go no farther than to the extent of their commission. Still, however, it is public war, because it is an external contention by force, between some of the members of the two nations, authorised by the legitimate powers. It is a war between the two nations, though all the <span class="star-pagination">*41</span> members are not authorised to commit hostilities such as in a solemn war, where the government restrain the general power.</p>
<p>Now, if this be the true definition of war, let us see what was the situation of the United States in relation to France. In March 1799, congress had raised an army; stopped all intercourse with France; dissolved our treaty; built and equipt ships of war; and commissioned private armed ships; enjoining the former, and authorising the latter, to defend themselves against the armed ships of France, to attack them on the high seas, to subdue and take them as prize, and to re-capture armed vessels found in their possession. Here, then, let me ask, what were the technical characters of an American and French armed vessel, combating on the high seas, with a view the one to subdue the other, and to make prize of his property? They certainly were not friends, because there was a contention by force; nor were they private enemies, because the contention was external, and authorised by the legitimate authority of the two governments. If they were not our enemies, I know not what constitutes an enemy.</p>
<p>2d. But, secondly, it is said, that a war of the imperfect kind, is more properly called acts of hostility, or reprizal, and that congress did not mean to consider the hostility subsisting between France and the United States, as constituting a state of war.</p>
<p>In support of this position, it has been observed, that in no law prior to March 1799, is France styled our enemy, nor are we said to be at war. This is true; but neither of these things were necessary to be done: because as to France, she was sufficiently described by the title of the French republic; and as to America, the degree of hostility meant to be carried on, was sufficiently described without declaring war, or declaring that we were at war. Such a declaration by congress, might have constituted a perfect state of war, which was not intended by the government.</p>
<p>3d. It has, likewise, been said, that the 7th section of the act of March 1799, embraces cases which, according to pre-existing laws, could not then take place, because no authority had been given to re-capture friendly vessels from the French; and this argument was strongly and forcibly pressed.</p>
<p>But, because every case provided for by this law was not then existing, it does not follow, that the law should not operate upon such as did exist, and upon the rest whenever they should arise. It is a permanent law, embracing a variety of subjects, not made in relation to the present war with France only, but in relation to any future war with her, or with any other nation. It might then very properly allow salvage for re-capturing of American vessels from France, which had previously been authorised by law, though it could not immediately apply to the vessels of friends: and whenever such a war should exist between the United States and France, or any other nation, as according to the law of nations, <span class="star-pagination">*42</span> or special authority, would justify the re-capture of friendly vessels, it might on that event, with similar propriety, apply to them; which furnishes, I think, the true construction of the act.</p>
<p>The opinion which I delivered at New-York, in Talbot v. Seaman, was, that although an American vessel could not justify the re-taking of a neutral vessel from the French, because neither the sort of war that subsisted, nor the special commission under which the American acted, authorised the proceeding; yet, that the 7th sect. of the act of 1799, applied to re-captures from France as an enemy, in all cases authorised by congress. And on both points, my opinion remains unshaken; or rather has been confirmed by the very able discussion which the subject has lately undergone in this Court, on the appeal from my decree. Another reason has been assigned by the defendant's counsel, why the former law is not to be regarded as repealed by the latter, to wit: that a subsequent affirmative general law cannot repeal a former affirmative special law, if both may stand together. This ground is not taken, because such an effect involves an indecent censure upon the legislature for passing contradictory laws, since the censure only applies where the contradiction appears in the same law; and it does not follow, that a provision which is proper at one time may not be improper at another, when circumstances are changed: but the ground of argument is, that a change ought not to be presumed. Yet, if there is sufficient evidence of such a change in the legislative will, and the two laws are in collision, we are forced to presume it.</p>
<p>What then is the evidence of legislative will? In fact and in law we are at war: an American vessel fighting with a French vessel, to subdue and make her prize, is fighting with an enemy accurately and technically speaking: and if this be not sufficient evidence of the legislative mind, it is explained in the same law. The sixth and the ninth sections of the act speak of prizes, which can only be of property taken at sea from an enemy, jure belli; and the 9th section speaks of prizes as taken from an enemy, in so many words, alluding to prizes which had been previously taken: but no prize could have been then taken except from France: prizes taken from France were, therefore, taken from the enemy. This then is a legislative interpretation of the word enemy; and if the enemy as to prizes, surely they preserve the same character as to re-captures. Besides, it may be fairly asked, why should the rate of salvage be different in such a war as the present, from the salvage in a war more solemn or general? And it must be recollected, that the occasion of making the law of March 1799, was not only to raise the salvage, but to apportion it to the hazard in which the property re-taken was placed; a circumstance for which the former salvage law had not provided.</p>
<p>The two laws, upon the whole, cannot be rendered consistent, unless the Court could wink so hard as not to see and know, that <span class="star-pagination">*43</span> in fact, in the view of congress, and to every intent and purpose, the possession by a French armed vessel of an American vessel, was the possession of an enemy: and, therefore, in my opinion, the decree of the Circuit Court ought to be affirmed.</p>
<p>CHASE, Justice.</p>
<p>The Judges agreeing unanimously in their opinion, I presumed that the sense of the Court would have been delivered by the president; and therefore, I have not prepared a formal argument on the occasion. I find no difficulty, however, in assigning the general reasons, which induce me to concur in affirming the decree of the Circuit Court.</p>
<p>An American public vessel of war re-captures an American merchant vessel from a French privateer, after 96 hours possession, and the question is stated, what salvage ought to be allowed? There are two laws on the subject: by the first of which, only one-eighth of the value of the re-captured property is allowed; but by the second, the re-captor is entitled to a moiety. The re-capture happened after the passing of the latter law: and the whole controversy turns on the single question, whether France was at that time an enemy? If France was an enemy, then the law obliges us to decree one half of the value of ship and cargo for salvage: but if France was not an enemy, then no more than one-eighth can be allowed.</p>
<p>The decree of the Circuit Court (in which I presided) passed by consent; but although I never gave an opinion, I have never entertained a doubt on the subject. Congress is empowered to declare a general war, or congress may wage a limited war; limited in place, in objects, and in time. If a general war is declared, its extent and operations are only restricted and regulated by the jus belli, forming a part of the law of nations; but if a partial war is waged, its extent and operation depend on our municipal laws.</p>
<p>What, then, is the nature of the contest subsisting between America and France? In my judgment, it is a limited, partial, war. Congress has not declared war in general terms; but congress has authorised hostilities on the high seas by certain persons in certain cases. There is no authority given to commit hostilities on land; to capture unarmed French vessels, nor even to capture French armed vessels lying in a French port; and the authority is not given, indiscriminately, to every citizen of America, against every citizen of France; but only to citizens appointed by commissions, or exposed to immediate outrage and violence. So far it is, unquestionably, a partial war; but, nevertheless, it is a public war, on account of the public authority from which it emanates.</p>
<p>There are four acts, authorised by our government, that are demonstrative a of state of war. A belligerent power has a right, by the law of nations, to search a neutral vessel; and, upon <span class="star-pagination">*44</span> suspicion of a violation of her neutral obligations, to seize and carry her into port for further examination. But by the acts of congress, an American vessel it authorised: 1st. To resist the search of a French public vessel: 2d. To capture any vessel that should attempt, by force, to compel submission to a search: 3d. To re-capture any American vessel seized by a French vessel; and 4th. To capture any French armed vessel wherever found on the high seas. This suspension of the law of nations, this right of capture and re-capture, can only be authorised by an act of the government, which is, in itself, an act of hostility. But still it is a restrained, or limited, hostility; and there are, undoubtedly, many rights attached to a general war, which do not attach to this modification of the powers of defence and aggression. Hence, whether such shall be the denomination of the relative situation of America and France, has occasioned great controversy at the bar; and, it appears, that Sir William Scott, also, was embarrassed in describing it, when he observed, that "in the present state of hostility (if so it may be called) between America and France," it is the practice of the English Court of Admiralty to restore, re-captured American property, on payment of a salvage. Rob. Rep. 54. The Santa Cruz. But, for my part, I cannot perceive the difficulty of the case. As there may be a public general war, and a public qualified war; so there may, upon correspondent principles, be a general enemy, and a partial enemy. The designation of "enemy" extends to a case of perfect war; but as a general designation, it surely includes the less, as well as the greater, species of warfare. If congress had chosen to declare a general war, France would have been a general enemy; having chosen to wage a partial war, France was, at the time of the capture, only a partial enemy; but still she was an enemy.</p>
<p>It has been urged, however, that congress did not intend the provisions of the act of March 1799, for the case of our subsisting qualified hostility with France, but for the case of a future state of general war with any nation: I think, however, that the contrary appears from the terms of the law itself, and from the subsequent repeal. In the 9th section it is said, that all the money accruing, "or which has already accrued from the sale of prizes," shall constitute a fund for the half-pay of officers and seamen. Now, at the time of making this appropriation, no prizes, (which ex vi termini implies a capture in a state of war) had been taken from any nation but France, those which had been taken, were not taken from France as a friend: they must consequently have been taken from her as an enemy; and the retrospective provision of the law can only operate on such prizes. Besides, when the 13th section regulates "the bounty given by the United States on any national ship of war, taken from the enemy, and brought into port," it is obvious, that even if the bounty has no relation to previous captures, it must operate from the moment of passing the <span class="star-pagination">*45</span> act, and embraces the case of a national ship of war taken from France as an enemy, according to the existing qualified state of hostilities. But the repealing act, passed on the 3d of March 1800, (subsequent to the re-capture in the present case) ought to silence all doubt, as to the intention of the legislature: for, if the act of March 1799, did not apply to the French republic, as an enemy, there could be no reason for altering, or repealing, that part of it, which regulates the rate of salvage on re-captures.</p>
<p>The acts of congress have been analysed to show, that a war is not openly denounced against France, and that France is no where expressly called the enemy of America: but this only proves the circumspection and prudence of the legislature. Considering our national prepossessions in favour of the French republic, congress had an ardous task to perform, even in preparing for necessary defence, and just retaliation. As the temper of the people rose, however, in resentment of accumulated wrongs, the language and the measures of the government became more and more energetic and indignant; though hitherto the popular feeling may not have been ripe for a solemn declaration of war; and an active and powerful opposition in our public councils, has postponed, if not prevented that decisive event, which many thought would have best suited the interest, as well as the honour of the United States. The progress of our contest with France, indeed, resembles much the progress of our revolutionary contest; in which, watching the current of public sentiment, the patriots of that day proceeded, step by step, from the supplicatory language of petitions for a redress of grievances, to the bold and noble declaration of national independence.</p>
<p>Having, then, no hesitation in pronouncing, that a partial war exists between America and France, and that France was an enemy, within the meaning of the act of March 1799, my voice must be given for affirming the decree of the Circuit Court.</p>
<p>PATERSON, Justice.</p>
<p>As the case appears on the record, and has been accurately stated by the counsel, and by the judges, who have delivered their opinions, it is not necessary to recapitulate the facts. My opinion shall be expressed in a few words. The United States and the French republic are in a qualified state of hostility. An imperfect war, or a war, as to certain objects, and to a certain extent, exists between the two nations; and this modified warfare is authorised by the constitutional authority of our country. It is a war quoad hoc. As far as congress tolerated and authorised the war on our part, so far may we proceed in hostile operations. It is a maritime war; a war at sea as to certain purposes. The national armed vessels of France attack and capture the national armed vessels of the United States; and the national armed vessels of the United States are expressly authorised and directed to attack, subdue, and take, the national armed vessels <span class="star-pagination">*46</span> of France, and also to re-capture American vessels. It is therefore a public war between the two nations, qualified, on our part, in the manner prescribed by the constitutional organ of our country. In such a state of things, it is scarcely necessary to add, that the term "enemy," applies; it is the appropriate expression, to be limited in its signification, import, and use, by the qualified nature and operation of the war on our part. The word enemy proceeds the full length of the war, and no farther. Besides, the intention of the legislature as to the meaning of this word, enemy, is clearly deducible from the act for the government of the navy, passed the 2d of March 1799. This act embraces the past, present, and future, and contains passages, which point the character of enemy at the French, in the most clear and irresistible manner. I shall select one paragraph, namely, that which refers to prizes taken by our public vessels, anterior to the passing of the latter act. The word prizes in this section can apply to the French, and the French only. This is decisive on the subject of legislative intention.</p>
<p>By the COURT:</p>
<p>Let the decree of the Circuit Court be affirmed.</p>

<p><span class="star-pagination">*5</span> *The cause now came on to be argued at August *6 term, 1801, by Bayard and Ingersol, for the libellant, and Dallas, Mason and Levy, for the claimant.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*25</span> August 11. MARSHALL, Ch. J. delivered the opinion of the court.</p>
<p>This is a writ of error to a decree of the circuit court for the district of New-York, by which the decree of the district court of that state, restoring the ship Amelia to her owner on the payment of one half <span class="star-pagination">*26</span> for salvage, was reversed, and a decree rendered, directing the restoration of the vessel without salvage.</p>
<p>*27 *The facts agreed by the parties, and the pleadings in the cause, present the following case:</p>
<p>The ship Amelia sailed from Calcutta, in Bengal, in April, 1799, loaded with a cargo of the product and manufactory of that country, and was bound to Hamburgh. On the 6th September, she was captured by the French national corvette La Diligente, commanded by L.J. Dubois, who took out the captain, part of the crew, and most of the papers of the Amelia, and, putting a prizemaster and French sailors on board her, ordered her to St. Domingo, to be judged according to the laws of war.</p>
<p>On the 15th of September, she was recaptured by Captain Talbot, commander of the Constitution, who ordered her into New-York for adjudication.</p>
<p>At the time of the recapture, the Amelia had eight iron cannon, and eight wooden guns, with which she left Calcutta. From the ship's papers, and other testimony, it appeared that she was the property of Chapeau Rouge, a citizen and merchant of Hamburgh; and it was conceded by the counsel below, that France and Hamburgh were not in a state of hostility with each other, and that Hamburgh was to be considered as neutral between the present belligerent powers.</p>
<p>The district court of New-York, before whom the cause first came, decreed one half of the gross amount of the ship and cargo as salvage to the recaptors. The circuit court of New-York reversed this decree, from which reversal, the recaptors appealed to this court.</p>
<p>The Amelia was libelled as a French vessel, and the libellant prays that she may be condemned as prize; or, if restored to any person entitled to her as the former owner, that such restoration should be made on paying salvage. The claim and answer of Hans Frederic Seeman, discloses the neutral character of the vessel, and claims her on behalf of the owners.</p>
<p>The questions growing out of the facts, and to be decided by the court, are,</p>
<p>*28 *Is Captain Talbot, the plaintiff in error, entitled to any, and if to any, to what salvage in the case which has been stated?</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*28</span> Salvage is a compensation for actual service rendered to the property charged with it.</p>
<p>It is demandable of right for vessels saved from pirates, or from the enemy.</p>
<p>In order, however, to support the demand, two circumstances must concur.</p>
<p>1. The taking must be lawful.</p>
<p>2. There must be a meritorious service rendered to the recaptured.</p>
<p>1. The taking must be lawful; for no claim can be maintained in a court of justice, founded on an act in itself tortious. On a recapture, therefore, made by a neutral power, no claim for salvage can arise, because the act of retaking is a hostile act, not justified by the situation of the nation to which the vessel making the recapture belongs, in relation to that from the possession of which such recaptured vessel was taken. The degree of service rendered the rescued vessel is precisely the same as if it had been rendered by a belligerent; yet the rights accruing to the recaptor are not the same, because no right can accrue from an act in itself unlawful.</p>
<p>In order, then, to decide on the right of Captain Talbot, it becomes necessary to examine the relative situation of the United States and France at the date of the recapture.</p>
<p>The whole powers of war being, by the constitution of the United States, vested in congress, the acts of that body can alone be resorted to as our guides in this inquiry. It is not denied, nor in the course of the argument has it been denied, that congress may authorize general hostilities, in which case the general laws of war apply to our situation; or partial hostilities, in which case the laws of war, so far as they actually apply to our situation, must be noticed.</p>
<p>*To determine the real situation of America in regard *29 to France, the acts of congress are to be inspected.</p>
<p>The first act on this subject passed on the 28th of May, 1798, and is entitled "An act more effectually to protect the commerce and coasts of the United States."</p>
<p>This act authorizes any armed vessel of the United States to capture any armed vessel sailing under the <span class="star-pagination">*29</span> authority, or pretence of authority, of the republic of France, which shall have committed depredations on vessels belonging to the citizens of the United States, or which shall be found hovering on the coasts for the purpose of committing such depredations. It also authorizes the recapture of vessels belonging to the citizens of the United States.</p>
<p>On the 25th of June, 1798, an act was passed "to authorize the defence of the merchant vessels of the United States against French depredations."</p>
<p>This act empowers merchant vessels, owned wholly by citizens of the United States, to defend themselves against any attack which may be made on them by the commander or crew of any armed vessel sailing under French colours, or acting, or pretending to act, by or under the authority of the French republic; and to capture any such vessel. This act also authorizes the recapture of merchant vessels belonging to the citizens of the United States. By the 2d section, such armed vessel is to be brought in and condemned for the use of the owners and captors.</p>
<p>By the same section, recaptured vessels belonging to the citizens of the United States, are to be restored, they paying for salvage not less than one eighth nor more than one half of the true value of such vessel and cargo.</p>
<p>On the 28th of June, an act passed "in addition to the act more effectually to protect the commerce and coasts of the United States."</p>
<p>This authorizes the condemnation of vessels brought in under the first act, with their cargoes, excepting only from such condemnation the goods of any citizen *30 or person *resident within the United States, which shall have been before taken by the crew of such captured vessel.</p>
<p>The second section provides that whenever any vessel or goods, the property of any citizen of the United States or person resident therein, shall be recaptured, the same shall be restored, he paying for salvage one eighth part of the value, free from all deductions.</p>
<p>On the 9th of July another law was enacted, "further to protect the commerce of the United States."</p>
<p>This act authorizes the public armed vessels of the United States to take any armed French vessel found on the high seas. It also directs such armed vessel, <span class="star-pagination">*30</span> with her apparel, guns, &amp;c. and the goods and effects found on board, being French property, to be condemned as forfeited.</p>
<p>The same power of capture is extended to private armed vessels.</p>
<p>The 6th section provides, that the vessel or goods of any citizen of the United States, or person residing therein, shall be restored, on paying for salvage not less than one eighth, nor more than one half, of the value of such recapture, without any deduction.</p>
<p>The 7th section of the act for the government of the navy, passed the 2d of March, 1799, enacts, "That for the ships or goods belonging to the citizens of the United States, or to the citizens or subjects of any nation in amity with the United States, if retaken within twenty-four hours, the owners are to allow one eighth part of the whole value for salvage," and if they have remained above ninety-six hours in possession of the enemy, one half is to be allowed.</p>
<p>On the 3d of March, 1800, congress passed "An act providing for salvage in cases of recapture."</p>
<p>This law regulates the salvage to be paid "when any vesels or goods, which shall be taken as prize as aforesaid, shall appear to have before belonged to any person or persons *permanently resident within the territory, *31 and under the protection, of any foreign prince, government or state, in amity with the United States, and to have been taken by an enemy of the United States, or by authority, or pretence of authority, from any prince, government, or state, against which the United States have authorized, or shall authorize, defence or reprisals."</p>
<p>These are the laws of the United States, which define their situation in regard to France, and which regulate salvage to accrue on recaptures made in consequence of that situation.</p>
<p>A neutral armed vessel which has been captured, and which is commanded and manned by Frenchmen, whether found cruising on the high seas, or sailing directly for a French port, does not come within the description of those which the laws authorize an American ship of war to capture, unless she be considered quoad hoc as a French vessel.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*31</span> Very little doubt can be entertained but that a vessel thus circumstanced, encountering an American unarmed merchantman, or one which should be armed, but of inferior force, would as readily capture such merchantman as if she had sailed immediately from the ports of France. One direct and declared object of the war, then, which was the protection of the American commerce, would as certainly require the capture of such a vessel as of others more determinately specified. But the rights of a neutral vessel, which the government of the United States cannot be considered as having disregarded, here intervene; and the vessel certainly is not, correctly speaking, a French vessel.</p>
<p>If the Amelia was not, on the 15th of September, 1799, a French vessel within the description of the act of congress, could her capture be lawful?</p>
<p>It is, I believe, a universal principle, which applies to those engaged in a partial, as well as those engaged in a general war, that where there is probable cause to believe the vessel met with at sea is in the condition *32 of one *liable to capture, it is lawful to take her, and subject her to the examination and adjudication of the courts.</p>
<p>The Amelia was an armed vessel commanded and manned by Frenchmen. It does not appear that there was evidence on board to ascertain her character. It is not then to be questioned, but that there was probable cause to bring her in for adjudication.</p>
<p>The recapture, then, was lawful.</p>
<p>But it has been insisted that this recapture was only lawful in consequence of the doubtful character of the Amelia, and that no right of salvage can accrue from an act which was founded in mistake, and which is only justified by the difficulty of avoiding error, arising from the doubtful circumstances of the case.</p>
<p>The opinion of the court is, that had the character of the Amelia been completely ascertained by Captain Talbot, yet as she was an armed vessel under French authority, and in a condition to annoy the American commerce, it was his duty to render her incapable of mischief. To have taken out the arms, or the crew, was as little authorized by the construction of the act of congress contended for by the claimants, as to have taken possession of the vessel herself.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*32</span> It has, I believe, been practised in the course of the present war, and if not, is certainly very practicable, to man a prize and cruise with her for a considerable time without sending her in for condemnation. The property of such vessel would not, strictly speaking, be changed so as to become a French vessel, and yet it would probably have been a great departure from the real intent of congress, to have permitted such vessel to cruise unmolested. An armed ship under these circumstances might have attacked one of the public vessels of the United States. The acts which have been recited expressly authorize the capture of such vessel so commencing hostilities, by a private armed ship, but not by one belonging to the public. To suppose that a capture would in one case be lawful, and in the other unlawful; or to suppose that even in the limited state of hostilities in which we were placed, two *vessels armed and manned by the enemy, and *33 equally cruising on American commerce, might the one be lawfully captured, while the other, though an actual assailant, could not; or if captured, that the act could only be justified from the probable cause of capture furnished by appearances, would be to attribute a capriciousness to our legislation on the subject of war, which can only be proper when inevitable.</p>
<p>There must, then, be incidents growing out of those acts of hostility specifically authorized, which a fair construction of the acts will authorize likewise.</p>
<p>This was obviously the sense of congress.</p>
<p>If by the laws of congress on this subject, that body shall appear to have legislated upon a perfect conviction that the state of war in which this country was placed, was such as to authorize recaptures generally from the enemy; if one part of the system shall be manifestly founded on this construction of the other part, it would have considerable weight in rendering certain what might before have been doubtful.</p>
<p>Upon a critical investigation of the acts of congress it will appear, that the right of recapture is expressly given in no single instance, but that of a vessel or goods belonging to a citizen of the United States.</p>
<p>It will also appear that the quantum of salvage is <span class="star-pagination">*33</span> regulated, as if the right to it existed previous to the regulation.</p>
<p>Although no right of recapture is given in terms for the vessels and goods belonging to persons residing within the United States not being citizens, yet an act, passed so early as the 28th of June, 1798, declares, that vessels and goods of this description, when recaptured, shall be restored on paying salvage; thereby plainly indicating that such recapture was sufficiently warranted by law to be the foundation of a claim for salvage.</p>
<p>If the recapture of vessels of one description, not expressly authorized by the very terms of the act of *34 congress *be yet a rightful act, recognised by congress as the foundation for a claim to salvage, which claim congress proceeds to regulate, then it would seem that other recaptures from the same enemy are equally rightful; and where the claim they afford for salvage has not been regulated by congress, such claim must be determined by the principles of general law.</p>
<p>In this situation remained the recaptured vessels of any other power also at war with France, until the act of the 2d of March, 1799, which regulates the salvage demandable from them. Neither by that act, nor by any previous act, was a power given in terms, to recapture such vessels. But their recapture was an incident which unavoidably grew out of the state of the war. On the capture of a French vessel, having with her as a prize the vessel of such a power, the prize was inevitably recaptured. On the idea that the recapture was lawful, and that it was a foundation on which the right to salvage could stand, the legislature, in March, 1799, declare what the amount of that salvage should be.</p>
<p>The expression of this act is by no means explicit. If it extends to neutrals, then it governs in this case; if otherwise, the law respecting them continued still longer on the same ground with the law respecting a belligerent, prior to the passage of the act of the 2d of March, 1799. Thus it continued until the 3d of March, 1800, when the legislature regulated the salvage to be paid by neutrals, recaptured from a power against which the United States have authorized defence or reprisals.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*34</span> This act having passed subsequent to the recapture of the Amelia, can certainly not affect that case as to the quantity of salvage, or give a right to salvage which did not exist before. But it manifests, in like manner with the laws already commented on, the system which congress considered itself as having established. This act was passed at a time when no additional hostility against France could have been contemplated. It was only designed to keep up the defensive system which had before been formed, and which it was deemed necessary to continue, till the negotiation then pending should have a pacific termination. Accordingly, there is no expression in the act extending *the power of recapture, or giving it in the *35 case of neutrals. This power is supposed to exist as an incident growing out of the state of war, and the right to salvage produced by that power is regulated in the act.</p>
<p>In case of a recapture subsequent to the act, no doubt could be entertained but that salvage, according to its terms, would be demandable. Yet there is not a syllable in it which would warrant an idea that the right of recapture was extended by it, or did not exist before.</p>
<p>It must then have existed from the passage of the laws, which commenced a general resistance to the aggressions we had so long experienced and submitted to.</p>
<p>It is not unworthy of notice that the first regulation of the right of salvage in the case of a recapture, not expressly enumerated among the specified acts of hostility warranted by the law, is to be found in one of those acts which constitute a part of the very system of defence determined on by congress, and is the first which subjects to condemnation the prizes made by our public ships of war.</p>
<p>It has not escaped the consideration of the court that a legislative act, founded on a mistaken opinion of what was law, does not change the actual state of the law as to pre-existing cases.</p>
<p>This principle is not shaken by the opinion now given. The court goes no further than to use the provisions in one of several acts forming a general system, as explanatory of other parts of the same system; and this appears to be in obedience to the best established rules of exposition, <span class="star-pagination">*35</span> and to be necessary to a sound construction of the law.</p>
<p>An objection was made to the claim of salvage by one of the counsel for the defendant in error, unconnected with the acts of congress, and which it is proper here to notice.</p>
<p>He states that to give title to salvage, the means used must not only have produced the benefit, but must have *36 *been used with that sole view. For this he cites Beawes' Lex Mer. 158.</p>
<p>The principle is applied by Beawes to the single case of a vessel saved at sea by throwing overboard a part of her cargo. In that case the principle is unquestionably correct, and in the case of a recapture it is as unquestionably incorrect. The recaptor is seldom actuated by the sole view of saving the vessel, and in no case of the sort has the inquiry ever been made.</p>
<p>It is, then, the opinion of the court, on a consideration of the acts of congress, and of the circumstances of the case, that the recapture of the Amelia was lawful; and that, if the claim to salvage be in other respects well founded, there is nothing to defeat it in the character of the original taking.</p>
<p>It becomes then necessary to inquire,</p>
<p>2d. Whether there has been such a meritorious service rendered to the recaptured as entitles the recaptor to salvage.</p>
<p>The Amelia was a neutral ship, captured by a French cruiser, and recaptured while on her way to a French port, to be adjudged according to the laws of war.</p>
<p>It is stated to be the settled doctrine of the law of nations, that a neutral vessel captured by a belligerent is to be discharged without paying salvage: and for this several authorities have been quoted, and many more might certainly be cited. That such has been a general rule is not to be questioned. As little is it to be questioned that this rule is founded exclusively on the supposed safety of the neutral. It is expressly stated in the case of the War Onskan, cited from Robinson's Reports, to be founded on this plain principle, "that the liberation of a clear neutral from the hand of the enemy, is no essential service rendered to him, inasmuch as that the same enemy would be compelled, by the tribunals of his own country, after he had carried the neutral into port, to release <span class="star-pagination">*36</span> him with costs and damages for the injurious seizure and detention." It is not unfrequent to consider and speak of a *regular practice under a rule, as itself *37 forming a rule. A regular course of decisions on the text of the law, constitutes a rule of construction by which that text is to be applied to all similar cases: but alter the text, and the rule no longer governs. So in the case of salvage. The general principle is, that salvage is only payable where a meritorious service has been rendered. In the application of this principle, it has been decided that neutrals carried in by a belligerent for examination, being in no danger, receive no benefit from recapture; and ought not, therefore, to pay salvage.</p>
<p>The principle is that without benefit, salvage is not payable: and it is merely a consequence from this principle, which exempts recaptured neutrals from its payment. But let a nation change its laws and its practice on this subject; let its legislation be such as to subject to condemnation all neutrals captured by its cruisers, and who will say that no benefit is conferred by a recapture? In such a course of things the state of the neutral is completely changed. So far from being safe, he is in as much danger of condemnation as if captured by his own declared enemy. A series of decisions, then, and of rules founded on his supposed safety, no longer apply. Only those rules are applicable, which regulate a situation of actual danger. This is not, as it has been termed, a change of principle; but a preservation of principle by a practical application of it according to the original substantial good sense of the rule.</p>
<p>It becomes, then, necessary to inquire whether the laws of France were such as to have rendered the condemnation of the Amelia so extremely probable, as to create a case of such real danger, that her recapture by Captain Talbot must be considered as a meritorious service entitling him to salvage.</p>
<p>To prove this the counsel for the plaintiff in error has offered several decrees of the French government, and especially one of the 18th of January, 1798.</p>
<p>Objections have been made to the reading of these decrees as being the laws of a foreign nation, and therefore facts, which, like other facts, ought to have been *proved, and to have formed a part of the case stated *38 for the consideration of the court.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*38</span> That the laws of a foreign nation, designed only for the direction of its own affairs, are not to be noticed by the courts of other countries, unless proved as facts, and that this court, with respect to facts, is limited to the statement made in the court below, cannot be questioned. The real and only question is, whether the public laws of a foreign nation, on a subject of common concern to all nations, promulgated by the governing powers of a country, can be noticed as law by a court of admiralty of that country, or must be still further proved as a fact.</p>
<p>The negative of this proposition has not been maintained in any of the authorities which have been adduced. On the contrary, several have been quoted, (and such seems to have been the general practice,) in which the marine ordinances of a foreign nation are read as law without being proved as facts. It has been said that this is done by consent: that it is a matter of general convenience not to put parties to the trouble and expense of proving permanent and well known laws which it is in their power to prove; and this opinion is countenanced by the case cited from Douglas. If it be correct, yet this decree having been promulgated in the United States as the law of France, by the joint act of that department which is intrusted with foreign intercourse, and of that which is invested with the powers of war, seems to assume a character of notoriety which renders it admissible in our courts.</p>
<p>It is therefore the opinion of the court that the decree should be read as an authenticated copy of a public law of France interesting to all nations.</p>
<p>The decree ordains, that "the character of vessels, relative to their quality of neuter or enemy, shall be determined by their cargo; in consequence, every vessel found at sea, loaded in whole or in part with merchandise the production of England or her possessions, shall be declared good prize, whoever the owner of these goods or merchandise may be."</p>
<p>*39 *This decree subjects to condemnation in the courts of France a neutral vessel laden, in whole or in part, with articles the growth of England or any of its possessions. A neutral thus circumstanced cannot be considered as in a state of safety. His recaptor cannot be said to have rendered him no service. It cannot reasonably be contended that he would have been <span class="star-pagination">*39</span> discharged in the ports of the belligerent, with costs and damages.</p>
<p>Let us, then, inquire, whether this was the situation of the Amelia. The first fact states her to have sailed from Calcutta, in Bengal, in April, 1799, laden with a cargo of the product and manufacture of that country. Here it is contended that the whole of Bengal may possibly not be in possession of the English, and therefore it does not appear that the cargo was within the description of the decree. But to this it has been answered, that in inquiring whether the Amelia was in danger or not, this court must put itself in the place of a French court of admiralty, and determine as such court would have determined. Doing this, there seems to be no reason to doubt that the cargo, without inquiring into the precise situation of the British power in every part of Bengal, being prima facie of the product and manufacture of a possession of England, would have been so considered, unless the contrary could have been plainly shown.</p>
<p>The next fact relied on by the defendant in error is, that the Amelia was sent to be adjudged according to the laws of war, and from thence it is inferred that she could not have been judged according to the decree of the 18th of January.</p>
<p>It is to be remembered that these are the orders of the captor, and without a question, in the language of a French cruiser, a law of his own country furnishing a rule of conduct in time of war, will be spoken of as one of the laws of war.</p>
<p>But the third and fourth facts in the statement admit the Amelia, with her cargo, to have belonged to a citizen of Hamburgh, which city was not in a state of hostility with the republic of France, but was to be considered as neutral between the then belligerent powers.</p>
<p>*It has been contended that these facts not only do *40 not show the recaptured vessel to have been one on which the decree could operate, but positively show that the decree could not have affected her.</p>
<p>The whole statement taken together amounts to nothing more than that Hamburgh was a neutral city; and it is precisely against neutrals that the decree is in terms directed. To prove, therefore, that the Amelia <span class="star-pagination">*40</span> was a neutral vessel, is to prove her within the very words of the decree, and, consequently, to establish the reality of her danger.</p>
<p>Among the very elaborate arguments which have been used in this case, there are some which the court deem it proper more particularly to notice.</p>
<p>It has been contended that this decree might have been merely in terrorem; that it might never have been executed; and that, being in opposition to the law of nations, the court ought to presume it never would have been executed.</p>
<p>But the court cannot presume the laws of any country to have been enacted in terrorem; nor that they will be disregarded by its judicial authority. Their obligation on their own courts must be considered as complete; and without resorting either to public notoriety, or the declarations of our own laws on the subject, the decisions of the French courts must be admitted to have conformed to the rules prescribed by their government.</p>
<p>It has been contended that France is an independent nation, entitled to the benefits of the law of nations; and further, that if she has violated them, we ought not to violate them also, but ought to remonstrate against such misconduct.</p>
<p>These positions have never been controverted; but they lead to a very different result from that which they have been relied on as producing.</p>
<p>The respect due to France is totally unconnected with the danger in which her laws had placed the *41 Amelia; nor *is France in any manner to be affected by the decree this court may pronounce. Her interest in the vessel was terminated by the recapture, which was authorized by the state of hostility then subsisting between the two nations. From that time it has been a question only between the Amelia and the recaptor, with which France has nothing to do.</p>
<p>It is true that a violation of the law of nations by one power does not justify its violation by another; but that remonstrance is the proper course to be pursued, and this is the course which has been pursued. America did remonstrate, most earnestly remonstrate, to France against the injuries committed on her; but, remonstrance having failed, she appealed to a higher <span class="star-pagination">*41</span> tribunal, and authorized limited hostilities. This was not violating the law of nations, but conforming to it. In the course of these limited hostilities the Amelia has been recaptured, and the inquiry now is, not whether the conduct of France would justify a departure from the law of nations, but what is the real law in the case. This depends on the danger from which she has been saved.</p>
<p>Much has been said about the general conduct of France and England on the seas, and it has been urged that the course of the latter has been still more injurious than that of the former. That is a consideration not to be taken up in this cause. Animadversions on either, in the present case, would be considered as extremely unbecoming the judges of this court, who have only to inquire what was the real danger in which the laws of one of the countries placed the Amelia, and from which she has been freed by her recapture.</p>
<p>It has been contended that an illegal commission to take, given by France, cannot authorize our vessels to retake; that we have no right by legislation to grant salvage out of the property of a citizen of Hamburgh, who might have objected to the condition of the service.</p>
<p>But it is not the authority given by the French government to capture neutrals, which is legalizing the recapture made by Captain Talbot; it is the state of hostility between the two nations which is considered as having authorized that act. The recapture having been made lawfully, then the right to salvage, on general principles, depends *on the service rendered. *42 We cannot presume this service to have been unacceptable to the Hamburgher, because it has bettered his condition; but a recapture must always be made without consulting the recaptured. The act is one of the incidents of war, and is in itself only offensive as against the enemy. The subsequent fate of the recaptured depends on the service he has received, and on other circumstances.</p>
<p>To give a right to salvage, it is said there must be a contract either express or implied.</p>
<p>Had Hamburgh been in a state of declared war with France, the recaptured vessels of that city would be <span class="star-pagination">*42</span> admitted to be liable to pay salvage. If a contract be necessary, from what circumstances would the law, in that state of things imply it? Clearly from the benefit received, and the risk incurred. If in the actual state of things there was also benefit and risk, then the same circumstances concur, and they warrant the same result.</p>
<p>It is also urged that to maintain this right, the danger ought not to be merely speculative, but must be imminent and the loss certain.</p>
<p>That a mere speculative danger will not be sufficient to entitle a person to salvage is unquestionably true. But that the danger must be such, that escape from it by other means was inevitable, cannot be admitted.</p>
<p>In all the cases stated by the counsel for the defendant in error, safety by other means was possible, though not probable. The flames of a ship on fire might be extinguished by the crew, or by a sudden tempest. A ship on the rocks might possibly be got off by the aid of wind and tides without assistance from others. A vessel captured by an enemy might be separated from her captor, and if sailors had been placed on board the prize, a thousand accidents might possibly destroy them; or they might even be blown by a storm into a port of the country to which the prize vessel originally belonged.</p>
<p>It cannot, therefore, be necessary that the loss should be inevitably certain; but it is necessary that the *43 danger should *be real and imminent. It is believed to have been so in this case. The captured vessel was of such description that the law by which she was to be tried, condemned her as good prize to the captor. Her danger, then, was real and imminent. The service rendered her was an essential service, and the court is therefore of opinion that the recaptor is entitled to salvage.</p>
<p>The next object of inquiry is, what salvage ought to be allowed? The captors claim one half the gross value of the ship and cargo. To support this claim they rely on the "act for the government of the navy of the United States," passed the 2d of March, 1799. This act regulates the salvage payable on the ships and goods belonging to the citizens of the United States, or to the citizens <span class="star-pagination">*43</span> of subjects of any nation in amity with the United States, retaken from the enemy.</p>
<p>It has been contended that the case before the court is in the very words of the act. That the owner of the Amelia is a citizen of a state in amity with the United States, retaken from the enemy. That the description would have been more limited had the intention of the act been to restrain its application to a recaptured vessel belonging to a nation engaged with the United States against the same enemy.</p>
<p>The words of the act would certainly admit of this construction.</p>
<p>Against it it has been urged, and we think with great force, that the laws of the United States ought not, if it be avoidable, so to be construed as to infract the common principles and usages of nations, or the general doctrines of national law. If the construction contended for be given to the act, it subjects to the same rate of salvage a recaptured neutral, and a recaptured belligerent vessel. Yet, according to the law of nations, a neutral is generally to be restored without salvage.</p>
<p>This argument, in the opinion of the court, derives great additional weight from the consideration that the act in question is not temporary, but permanent. It is not merely fitted to the then existing state of things, and *calculated to expire with them, but is a regulation applying *44 to present and future times.</p>
<p>Whenever the danger resulting to captured neutrals from the laws of France should cease, then, according to the principles laid down in this decree, the liability of recaptured neutrals to the payment of salvage would, in conformity with the general law and usage of nations, cease also. This event might have happened, and probably did happen, before hostilities between the United States and France were terminated by treaty. Yet, if this law applies to the case, salvage from a recaptured neutral would still be demandable.</p>
<p>This act, then, if the words admit it, since it provides a permanent rule for the payment of salvage, ought to be construed to apply only to cases in which salvage is permanently payable.</p>
<p>On inspecting the clause in question, the court is struck with the description of those from whom the vessel is to be retaken in order to come within the provisions <span class="star-pagination">*44</span> of the act. The expression used is the enemy. A vessel retaken from the enemy. The enemy of whom? The court thinks it not unreasonable to answer, of both parties. By this construction the act of congress will never violate those principles which we believe, and which it is our duty to believe, the legislature of the United States will always hold sacred.</p>
<p>If this act does not comprehend the case, then the court is to decide, on a just estimate of the danger from which the recaptured was saved, and of the risk attending the retaking of the vessel, what is a reasonable salvage. Considering the circumstances, and considering also what rule has been adopted in other courts of admiralty, one sixth appears to be a reasonable allowance.</p>
<p>It is therefore the opinion of the court, that the decree of the circuit court, held for the district of New-York, was correct in reversing the decree of the district court, but not correct in decreeing the restoration of the Amelia without paying salvage. This court, therefore, is of opinion, that the decree, so far as the restoration of the *45 *Amelia without salvage is ordered, ought to be reversed, and that the Amelia and her cargo ought to be restored to the claimant, on paying for salvage one sixth part of the net value, after deducting therefrom the charges which have been incurred.</p>

It was, accordingly, argued again at Washington, in August term 1801, by Ingersoll and Bayard (of Delaware) for the plaintiff in error; and by M. Levy, J.T.

<center><p><b>Supreme Court of United States.</b></p></center>
<center></center>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*111</span> The cause was, at this term, argued by C. Lee, for plaintiff in error, and Simms and Mason, for defendant.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*113</span> CHASE. J.</p>
<p>Have the rules of the Virginia courts been adopted in the circuit court?</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*114</span> Lee. I conceive the circuit court of Alexandria to be in the same situation as the district court at Richmond. And, as I understand the act of congress, they are obliged to adopt the practice of the courts of Virginia, except where the circuit court has actually made a different rule.</p>
<p>*115 *Simms, for defendant in error.</p>
<p>I will not deny that the courts of Virginia have gone the length stated in Washington's Reports. They have used their discretion, and have considered whether the plea offered tends to the justice of the cause, or whether it is intended only for delay. In this case, the time having passed when the defendant could file his plea as a matter of right, it was entirely in the discretion of the court to admit or reject it.</p>
<p>It is certainly not a sufficient justification for the defendant to say that the magistrate committed the plaintiff; for that neither destroys the evidence of express malice, nor shows probable cause for the prosecution. The magistrate might have committed upon the evidence of the defendant Resler himself; so that this plea would most probably have been overruled upon demurrer, and at any rate would have created delay; for in a matter of so much consequence, it cannot be presumed that the counsel for the plaintiff could at once determine whether to demur or to join issue.</p>
<p>The defendant was not precluded from making a proper defence. He might have shown probable cause on the general issue, for the gist of the action is the want of probable cause; and the court had the power of instructing the jury whether such cause was shown or not. Bull. N.P. 14.</p>
<p>It is said that the plea was offered in a reasonable time. It cannot surely be said that three days in the hurry of the court is a reasonable time to answer such a plea Â— so say the courts of Virginia.</p>
<p>This plea amounts to the general issue, and therefore ought not to have been received. The justice of the case did not require it, and it is only to promote justice that the courts have ever deviated from the precise terms of the law.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*115</span> Mason, on the same side.</p>
<p>Admitting for a moment that the practice of the Virginia courts was binding upon the circuit court, yet the *court have only exercised the same discretion which a Virginia court might have exercised. There is a particular time allowed for special pleading; after that time, the admission of a plea is discretionary with the court. The case in Washington's Reports is clear to show that it is altogether a matter of discretion. The court might have refused to receive any plea at all; for the right of the defendant to set aside the office judgment, by pleading to issue, is confined to the court next succeeding the office judgment.</p>
<p>But the defendant had every advantage under the general issue, which he could have had under his plea. It is extremely clear that the plaintiff must show malice, and the defendant matter of justification. The rules of practice in the courts of Virginia, are confined to Virginia. The courts of the United States are not bound by them. They have power to make their own rules.</p>
<p>Lee, in reply.</p>
<p>Our complaint is, that the inferior court has not exercised its discretion in the manner it ought to do. I use the word discretion differently from Mr. Mason. The exercise of such discretion is subject to the control of this court. If we look to the decisions of the courts in Virginia, we find that they have soundly exercised their discretionary power. The practice has constantly been to let in the parties notwithstanding any laches. Was it proper in the court to say, that although we have a right to suffer you to bring the question of probable cause before the court, and to take it from the jury, and although you wish so to do, yet we will not permit you, but will compel you to go before the jury; where facts disclosed, not pertinent to the issue, might make an improper impression?</p>
<p>CUSHING, J. Do you admit that the defendant might have given in evidence, under the general issue, the facts stated in the plea offered?</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*116</span> Lee. It is sufficient for us if it was a matter of doubt. In such a case, a cautious practitioner will always take the safest method, and plead the facts specially.</p>
<p>*117 *There is no doubt but the court had a right to make rules of practice for itself. But not having made such a rule in this case, its discretion ought to have been guided by the practice of the Virginia courts. We therefore hope that this court will correct the indiscreet exercise of the power of the court below in this case.</p>
<p>The Court. It is true that the courts in Virginia have been very liberal in admitting any plea, at the next term after an office judgment, which was necessary to bring forward the substantial merits of the case, whether it was strictly an issuable plea, or not. But at a subsequent term, it is a matter of mere discretion with the court whether they will admit any special plea at all.</p>
<p>In the present case the facts stated in the plea offered, might have been given in evidence on the general issue; the court exercised their discretion soundly in rejecting the plea.</p>
<p>Judgment affirmed.</p>

<p>Lee, for the plaintiff in error.</p>
<p>Mason, for defendant in error.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*87</span> The court took time till this term to consider, and now the Chief Justice delivered the following opinion:</p>
<p>Opinion of the Court.</p>
<p>This is a writ of error to a judgment of the court of the United States for the district of Kentucky, rendered on a caveat, and is governed by the land laws of Virginia.</p>
<p>*88 *In the year 1779, the legislature of that commonwealth opened a land-office, and offered for sale, with <span class="star-pagination">*88</span> some reservations, so much of that tract of country lying within its boundaries south-east of the river Ohio as was then unappropriated: a part of which now constitutes the state of Kentucky.</p>
<p>Every person who would pay at the rate of forty pounds for one hundred acres, into the treasury of the state, became entitled to such quantity of waste and unappropriated land as was, at that rate, equivalent to the money paid, for which a certificate was given to the register of the land-office, whose duty it was, on receipt thereof, to issue a warrant for the quantity of land purchased, authorizing any surveyor, qualified according to law, to lay off and survey the same. A warrant might also be issued on certain other rights.</p>
<p>A chief surveyor was appointed for each county, whose duty it was to nominate a sufficient number of deputies for the business of his county, and the law proceeded to direct, that "every person having a land warrant founded on any of the before-mentioned rights, and being desirous of locating the same on any particular waste and unappropriated lands, shall lodge such warrant with the chief surveyor of the county wherein the said lands, or the greater part of them, lie, who shall give a receipt for the same if required. The party shall direct the location thereof so specially and precisely as that others may be enabled with certainty to locate other warrants on the adjacent residuum; which location shall bear date on the day on which it shall be made, and shall be entered by the surveyor in a book to be kept for that purpose, in which there shall be left no blank leaves or spaces between the different entries."</p>
<p>George Mason was one of the earliest purchasers under this law.</p>
<p>On the 29th of April, 1780, he made the following entries:</p>
<p>"1780, 29th April, George Mason enters 8,400 acres of land, to begin on Panther creek on the east side *thereof, opposite to a beech on the west side about *89 four miles above the mouth of the west fork, and to run up and down the said creek, and eastwardly for quantity."</p>
<p>"1780, April 29th, George Mason enters 8,300 <span class="star-pagination">*89</span> acres, to begin at the upper corner of his 8,400 acre entry, and to run up the creek on the east side and back for quantity."</p>
<p>Panther creek pursues a general westwardly course from its source till it empties into Green river.</p>
<p>The creek forks something more than twelve miles and one quarter of a mile in a straight line above its mouth; and one of those forks, the direction of which towards its source is northwardly, has, from the beginning of the year 1780, been generally termed the west fork, and the other has been termed Panther creek.</p>
<p>On the 27th of October, 1780, Mr. Mason made the following entry with the same surveyor:</p>
<p>"1780, October the 27th, George Mason desires to make his entry of 8,400 acres, more special on Panther creek, viz. to begin four miles above the forks of Panther creek where it mouths into Green river on the east side, running up and back for quantity."</p>
<p>In the months of September and October, 1783, these two entries of 8,400 and 8,300 acres were surveyed by James Hord, one of the deputy surveyors of the county of Jefferson, which surveys, as was the custom, were made conformably to the instructions given by Mr. Mason's agent.</p>
<p>The survey of the entry of 8,400 acres is supposed to conform to the explanation or amendment of that entry made in October, 1780. It begins four miles above the mouth of Panther creek, and something more than eight miles below its forks.</p>
<p>The survey of the 8,300 acre entry adjoins the survey of 8,400 acres on the upper side; and the plat was shown by the surveyor, before he would return *90 it to the then agent *of Mr. Mason, who, after its supposed variance from the entry was suggested to him, approved it, and directed it to be returned to the office.</p>
<p>These surveys were returned in the course of the fall, 1783.</p>
<p>The supposed variance between the survey and location of the 8,300 acres was afterwards, about the 12th of September, 1784, pointed out by the surveyor to a subsequent agent of Mr. Mason, who also approved <span class="star-pagination">*90</span> of the manner in which the surveys were made, and returned them to the land-office.</p>
<p>On the 9th of April, 1783, George Wilson enters with the surveyor of Jefferson county 40,926 acres of land on Panther creek, so as entirely to include George Mason's survey of 8,300 acres.</p>
<p>This entry, though in the name of George Wilson, was made by John Handley, a deputy surveyor for Jefferson county, for his own benefit and that of Christopher Greenup, as well as for the benefit of George Wilson, and at the time of making the entry, full knowledge of the previous survey made of the same land for George Mason had been obtained by the said Handley, who had seen the surveys in the office, and had communicated this information to his two partners in the entry.</p>
<p>In the month of March, 1784, George Wilson entered, in the supreme court of the district of Kentucky, a caveat to prevent a grant from issuing on George Mason's survey of 8,300 acres, because the survey was made contrary to location, and because the entry was vague, he claiming the same, or so much thereof as interferes with his entry made on treasury warrants for 40,926 acres on the 9th of April, 1784.</p>
<p>Pending the caveat George Mason departed this life and the suit was revived against Richard Mason, devisee of the said George, at whose petition it was removed into the court of the United States, held for the district of Kentucky.</p>
<p>*A cross caveat was entered in the same court on the *91 part of Richard Mason, to prevent the issuing a patent to George Wilson, and these causes coming on to be heard, it was agreed that the judgment rendered in the caveat Wilson v. Mason, should be also entered in the case of Mason v. Wilson.</p>
<p>In June term, 1800, the opinion of the court for the district of Kentucky was given, that the defendant Mason had the better right, and it was ordered that the caveat entered by Wilson should be dismissed.</p>
<p>To this judgment the plaintiff Wilson has obtained a writ of error, and the principal question now to be decided by this court is, which of the parties has the better right.</p>
<p>But before entering on the question, it may be necessary <span class="star-pagination">*91</span> to notice a preliminary point made by the counsel for the defendant in error. He contends that in a caveat the decision of the district court is final, and that the cause cannot be carried before a superior tribunal.</p>
<p>To maintain this proposition he relies on an act of the legislature of Virginia, making the judgments of the district courts of the state final in cases of caveat; and on the compact between Virginia and Kentucky, which stipulates that rights acquired under the commonwealth of Virginia shall be decided according to the then existing laws.</p>
<p>This argument would not appear to be well founded had Virginia and Kentucky even been for every purpose independent nations; because the compact must be considered as providing for the preservation of titles, not of the tribunals which should decide on those titles. But when their situation in regard to the United States is contemplated, the court cannot perceive how a doubt could have existed respecting this point. The constitution of the United States, to which the parties to this compact had assented, gave jurisdiction to the federal courts in controversies between citizens of different states. The same constitution vested in this court an appellate jurisdiction in all cases where original jurisdiction *92 was given to the *inferior courts, with only "such exceptions, and under such regulations, as the congress shall make." Congress, in pursuance to the constitution, has passed a law on the subject, in which the appellate jurisdiction of this court is described in general terms so as to comprehend this case, nor is there in that law any exception or regulation which would exclude the case of a caveat from its general provisions. If, then, the compact between Virginia and Kentucky was even susceptible of the construction contended for, that construction could only be maintained on the principle that the legislatures of any two states might, by agreement between themselves, annul the constitution of the United States.</p>
<p>The jurisdiction of the court being perfectly clear, it remains to inquire which of the parties has the better right.</p>
<p>The title of Mason being eldest, is of course the best, if it be not in itself defective.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*92</span> In the caveat of the plaintiff in error two defects in the title of the defendant are assigned.</p>
<p>1st. That his entry is vague.</p>
<p>2dly. That he has surveyed contrary to his location.</p>
<p>The first was abandoned in argument, and does not appear to the court to have been maintainable.</p>
<p>The second shall now be considered.</p>
<p>To support the allegation that the survey has been made contrary to the location, the entry and the survey are produced.</p>
<p>The entry calls for a beginning on the upper corner of George Mason's entry of 8,400 acres. To ascertain this spot reference must be had to the entry called for. That is to begin on Panther creek, on the east side thereof, opposite to a beech on the west side, about four miles above the mouth of the west fork, and to run up and down the said creek and eastwardly for quantity.</p>
<p>*The branch of Panther creek which was at the date *93 of the entry generally denominated the west fork, is something more than twelve miles and one quarter of a mile above its mouth. The entry of 8,400 acres is to begin four miles above the west fork, and the land in controversy ought to be placed above that entry. Yet it is surveyed below the west fork.</p>
<p>To obviate this difficulty, the counsel for the defendant in error produces and relies upon the entry of October 27th, 1780.</p>
<p>That entry is in these words:</p>
<p>"George Mason desires to make his entry of 8,400 acres more special on Panther creek, viz. to begin four miles above the forks of Panther creek, where it mouths into Green river, on the east side, running up and back for quantity."</p>
<p>This entry is contended to be not a removal, but an explanation, of that which had been made on the 29th of April, 1780, and being merely an explanation, the survey of the land in controversy, beginning at the upper corner of the survey of the 8,400 acre tract, conforms to its original location, and is, consequently, free from the exception made to it.</p>
<p>If this position be true, the entry of the 27th of October, 1780, must describe the same land with that which is described, though with less certainty, by the entry of the 29th of April, in the same year.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*93</span> But the entry of the 29th of April calls for a beginning four miles above the mouth of the west fork of Panther creek, which fork is more than twelve miles in a straight line above the mouth of the creek, and the subsequent entry begins four miles above the forks of Panther creek where it mouths into Green river. The west fork of Panther creek, and the mouth of the same creek, where it empties into the river, are perfectly distinct and separate places, and were so understood at the time this location was made.</p>
<p>*94 *It is, however, contended, that in the extensive wilderness offered for sale, accuracy of description was not to be expected, and the point of union between a creek and river might well be mistaken for the forks of a creek.</p>
<p>This would not be very probable in any case, but is totally inadmissible in this, because names of places which they were generally understood to possess have been used by the person locating for Mr. Mason, and as there are no other controlling boundaries referred to, they must be understood as designating the water courses which were commonly described by those names, and which any person inclined to locate the adjacent residuum would necessarily suppose to have been referred to by them.</p>
<p>But if the location of October explains without removing that of April, then the original entry might, without such explanation, have been there surveyed, and could not have been properly surveyed four miles above the west fork.</p>
<p>This would scarcely have been attempted.</p>
<p>Indeed the counsel for the appellee, in admitting that an entry made on the land in controversy, subsequent to Mason's entry, but before his survey, would have been good, seems to have disclosed an opinion that the original entry did not comprehend the land in question, and that not the entry, but the survey, is to be relied on as the foundation of his title.</p>
<p>To the court it appears perfectly clear, that the entry of the 27th of October was a removal, and not an explanation, of that of the 29th of April.</p>
<p>It has not been contended that the removal of the 8,400 acre entry has also removed that of 8,300 acres.</p>
<p>The title of Mason, then, it good, must be shown to be <span class="star-pagination">*94</span> so by establishing that a survey without an entry is a sufficient foundation for a title.</p>
<p>With a view to discover whether this question has been settled in Kentucky, all the adjudications contained in the *book of reports furnished by the counsel for the *95 plaintiff in error have been examined. It is not perceived either that the question has been directly determined, or that any principles have been settled which govern it.</p>
<p>This case, then, is of the first impression.</p>
<p>The act of the Virginia legislature must be expounded according to the opinion this court may entertain of its import, without deriving any aid from the decisions of the state tribunals.</p>
<p>In 1779, Virginia opened a land-office for the sale of an extensive, unsettled, and almost unexplored country, the motives for which are stated in the preamble of the statute to have been "to encourage the migration of foreigners, promote population, increase the annual revenue, and create a fund for discharging the public debt."</p>
<p>Any person whatever might become a purchaser of any portion of these lands by paying into the treasury of the commonwealth the purchase-money required by law. By doing so he became entitled to a warrant authorizing any surveyor to lay off for him, in one or more surveys, the quantity of land purchased. It was apparently contemplated by the law that the number of purchasers would immediately become very considerable. The condition of these purchasers in this stage of the contract ought to be distinctly understood. They had acquired a right each to appropriate to himself so much of the vacant land belonging to the commonwealth as he had purchased, but no right either in common or severalty, to the whole or any particular part of the country, until such right should be acquired by further measures.</p>
<p>This was at the same time the situation of a great number of persons, and a prior was in no respect more eligibly circumstanced than a subsequent purchaser, except in the single case of both applying precisely at the same time, for the purpose of appropriating each to <span class="star-pagination">*95</span> himself the same land. Had the purchaser of the first warrant been negligent enough to hold it up until the whole land was appropriated, the title of every subsequent purchaser would have been good against him, *96 and he would have *been without remedy. The original purchase of a warrant, then, creating only a general claim which gave of itself only in a single case priority of right to the prior purchaser, it became indispensably necessary to prescribe a mode by which this general title should be satisfied by the appropriation of a particular tract of land.</p>
<p>This mode seems to have been prescribed by that part of the act which says, that "every person having a land warrant, and being desirous of locating the same on any particular waste and unappropriated lands, shall lodge such warrant with the surveyor of the county wherein the lands or the greater part of them lie." "The party shall direct the location thereof so specially and, precisely that others may be enabled, with certainty, to locate other warrants on the adjacent residuum; which location shall bear date the day on which it shall be made, and shall be entered by the surveyor in a book to be kept for that purpose."</p>
<p>This mode of appropriation pointed out by the law as that which must be used by any person desirous of locating a warrant on any particular waste and unappropriated land, requires that the location shall be given to the surveyor with the warrant in order to be entered in a book kept for that purpose, which is denominated the book of entries.</p>
<p>It is apparent throughout the whole act, that the legislature never contemplated a survey as being in itself an appropriation of land, or supposed that one would be ever made, if not founded on a previous entry.</p>
<p>Some few of the many passages which are found in various parts of the law will be selected to evince this position.</p>
<p>The surveyor is forbidden to admit the entry of any warrant on treasury rights, except pre-emption warrants, in his books before the first day of May next succeeding the passage of the act. But the prohibition does not extend to a survey, and yet this would have been equally necessary if land could have been appropriated by a survey without a previous location.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*97</span> *It is declared that no entry or location shall be admitted *97 for certain lands which are described in the act, and intended to be reserved: but there is no declaration that they shall not be surveyed. This omission manifests an opinion that they could not be appropriated by survey alone.</p>
<p>In prescribing the duty of a surveyor, the law enjoins him to proceed with all practicable despatch to survey all lands entered in his office; and many rules are given to regulate the surveying of entries; but there is not a syllable in the act which contemplates or makes a single provision for surveys not founded on a prior entry made in the book of entries.</p>
<p>The mode of appropriation, then, which the law designates has not been pursued; but it is contended that another course has been adopted which equally produces all the objects designed to be effected by the location in the book of entries, and which, therefore, ought to be received as a sufficient substitute for an entry.</p>
<p>The legislature of Virginia, when bringing her lands into the market, had undoubtedly a right to prescribe the terms on which she would sell, and the mode to be pursued by purchasers for the purpose of particularizing the general title acquired by obtaining a land warrant. The court is by no means satisfied of its power to substitute any equivalent act for that required by the law.</p>
<p>The case of Blackwell v. Harper, reported in 2 Atkyns, 93. has been cited to show the authority of a court to dispense with part of a statute directing the mode of proceeding to be observed by a person who claims title under such statute.</p>
<p>That case arose under an act of parliament which directs that "any person who shall invent, or design, engrave, &amp;c. any historical or other print or prints, shall have the sole right and liberty of printing and reprinting the same for the term of fourteen years, to commence from the day of the first publishing thereof, which shall be truly engraved with the name of the proprietor on each plate, and printed on every such print or prints." *The plaintiff had engraved certain medicinal *98 plants, a work deemed within the act, and had brought a bill to establish her right to the sole property <span class="star-pagination">*98</span> in them, and to restrain the defendant from copying and engraving them, upon the penalties within the act of parliament.</p>
<p>It was objected that the day of publication from which the term was to commence had not been engraved, and so the act had not been complied with, and, consequently, the property had not vested.</p>
<p>Lord Hardwicke was of opinion that the property vested, although the day of publication was not engraved, and that the words directing the day of publication to be engraved on each print were only necessary to make the penalties incur, not to give the title.</p>
<p>"Here," said his lordship, "the clause which vests the property is distinct."</p>
<p>This opinion, however, was given with great doubt, and only an injunction was granted without costs, and without an order for an account.</p>
<p>The case of Blackwell v. Harper has, at the bar, been denied to be law. However this may be, it is certainly essentially variant from that before the court.</p>
<p>The opinion of Lord Hardwicke was not that where any circumstance was required by a statute in order to vest a title, other equivalent acts might be received as a substitute; but that the particular statute on which the case depended, did not require the omitted circumstance, since the property was vested by a distinct clause.</p>
<p>By a reference to the words themselves, it will be perceived that the expression of the act of parliament is such as might perhaps warrant this opinion. The property is completely vested before the direction concerning the date of the publication is given, and Lord Hardwicke supposes it to be a question on which judges would differ whether the subsequent words were merely directory or descriptive. A perfect property in the specific thing was supposed by that judge to have been given by other words, and on that idea his decree is declared to have been formed.</p>
<p>*99 *But in the case under consideration no property in the specific thing is supposed to have been given by other words. No title to it is created by any other part of the act. The purchase of the land warrant gave a power to appropriate, but was no appropriation, and the mode pointed out by the legislature would <span class="star-pagination">*99</span> seem to the court to be that which can alone give title to the particular lands.</p>
<p>But if this opinion should even be too strict, if an act entirely equivalent to an entry could be received as a substitute for one, a survey does not appear to be such an act, nor does it seem to have been so considered by the legislature.</p>
<p>From the circumstances under which the act for establishing the land-office was passed, as well as from the expressions of that act, it is apparent that the entry was intended to give complete notice to other purchasers that the land located was already appropriated. The mode of giving this notice it was certainly proper to prescribe. By doing so, the numerous doubts and questions concerning the sufficiency of notice which would inevitably arise from leaving that important fact to the discretion of individuals, in the first instance, and then to the discretion of courts, to be exercised many years after all the lands should be located, would be in a considerable degree obviated.</p>
<p>It was doubtless an important object to obviate them.</p>
<p>The regulations, therefore, respecting entries are all calculated to make them as notorious as possible. Not so of surveys.</p>
<p>The entries and surveys are to be kept in separate books. Why so if a survey amounted to an entry?</p>
<p>The entry must be dated when made by the locator; but the time of recording a survey may appear or not at the discretion of the surveyor, and a subsequent survey may be recorded before one of prior date.</p>
<p>There are to be no blanks in the book of entries, and this regulation is well calculated for the prevention of *frauds in the origin of titles. It does not apply *100 to the book of surveys.</p>
<p>The book of entries is open to the inspection of every person. The book of surveys cannot be looked into but at the discretion of the surveyor.</p>
<p>If a prior entry be alleged, the person affected thereby has a right to demand a copy thereof; but no copy of a survey can be given to any other than the proprietor until twelve months after it shall have been made.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*100</span> From the whole act a legislative intention to make an entry, and an entry only, the foundation of title to any particular tract of land, is strongly to be inferred; and if even an equivalent act could be received, a survey does not appear to be such an act. In this particular case it is true that complete notice was obtained by it, but titles must rest on general principles, and in the general a survey would not, without something more than the law requires, be notice. The law, therefore, cannot contemplate a survey as of equal operation with an entry.</p>
<p>A question has been made at the bar, whether a caveat is in the nature of an equitable action, and on the supposition that it is of that nature, the counsel for the defendant in error has insisted that Wilson, having express notice of Mason's survey, was unable to acquire title to the land appropriated by that survey.</p>
<p>This would be true if the survey gave to Mason any title either in law or equity. But if a survey without an entry was no appropriation; if it gave no title, then notice of the survey could not create a title.</p>
<p>The doctrine of notice is well established. He who acquires a legal title, having notice of the prior equity of another, becomes a trustee for that other to the extent of his equity. But if he has no equity, then there is nothing for which the purchaser of the legal estate can be a trustee.</p>
<p>A point in the case still remains which appears more doubtful, and concerning which very considerable difficulties have been felt.</p>
<p>*101 *Although Mason's survey may give him no title, it is questioned whether Wilson can maintain a caveat against it.</p>
<p>The caveat is a remedy given to prevent a patent from issuing in certain cases where the directions of the law have been violated to the injury of the commonwealth, or where some other person hath a better right. The case before the court is that of a better right. The terms in which this remedy is accorded to the person who would avail himself of it for the purpose of asserting his own title are, "or if any person shall obtain a survey of lands to which another hath by law a better right, the person having such better right may in like manner enter a caveat," &amp;c.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*101</span> Considerable doubts were entertained whether the word "hath," in the description of the character by whom a caveat might be maintained, did not absolutely require that the better right should exist at the time the survey should be obtained. This construction, to which some of the court were at first greatly inclined, would have involved considerable inconvenience, and would have defeated what is deemed the essential object for which the remedy was given.</p>
<p>It has been already stated to be the opinion of the court, that a survey not founded on an entry is a void act, and constitutes no title whatever. Consequently, the land so surveyed remains vacant and liable to be appropriated by any person holding a land warrant. It is difficult to conceive that a remedy designed to enable an individual who has made his entry in conformity with the law, to prevent another from obtaining a grant for the land he has entered, should be withheld from any person whose entry entitles him to the land he has located. It is not less difficult to impute to the legislature an intention to protect a survey to which the law denies all power of appropriating the land it comprehends, or an intention of carrying such survey into grant, while another has legally appropriated to himself the land thus to be granted. It would be difficult to state a case to which the principle, that a remedy should be so extended as to meet the mischief, would apply more forcibly than to this. If, however, the *terms of the law had been explicit, those *102 terms must have controlled the subject. But the expression of the act is not, if any person shall obtain a survey to which another at the time such survey may be obtained shall have by law a better right, the person having such better right may enter a caveat, &amp;c. The words of the law are not thus express. They are, if any person shall obtain a survey of land to which another hath by law a better right. The word hath, in its most strict and rigid sense, would refer neither to the time of making the survey, nor of entering the caveat, but to the present moment when the word is used, and would require that the better right should exist at the time of the passage of the act. This construction <span class="star-pagination">*102</span> would be universally rejected as absurd, and all would expect the court to understand the words more liberally, and to expound them so as to give some effect to the legislative will. Some latitude of construction, then, must be used; some words additional to those used by the legislature must be understood, and this being apparent, the court perceive no sufficient motive for extending the remedy to rights existing when the survey shall be made, and denying it to those which are equally valid, and which exist when the caveat may be entered.</p>
<p>The caveat entered by Wilson is, therefore, maintainable under the land law of Virginia, since his title had accrued when it was entered.</p>
<p>The court is of opinion that the district court of Kentucky has erred in deciding that the defendant in error hath the better right, and that their judgment ought to be reversed and annulled. In pursuance of this opinion I am directed to deliver the following judgment.</p>
<p>Judgment of the Court.</p>
<p>"Whereupon, it is considered by the court that the plaintiff Wilson hath by law the better right to the land in controversy, and that the judgment of the court of the United States for the district of Kentucky be reversed and annulled; and that the register of the land-office in Kentucky do issue a grant to the said Wilson upon his survey of 30,000 acres of land registered in the said office, according to the metes and *103 bounds thereof, and *that the said plaintiff do also recover his costs expended in this court, and in the said district court, all which is ordered to be certified to the said district court, and the said register of the land-office accordingly."</p>
<p>In the case of Mason v. Wilson, the judgment of the court was, "that the defendant Wilson hath by law the better right to the land in controversy, and that the judgment of the court of the United States for the district of Kentucky be reversed and annulled; and that the said caveat be dismissed, and that the defendant Wilson recover his costs," &amp;c.<sup>[(a)]</sup></p>

<p class="parties">The UNITED STATES<br/>v.<br/>The SCHOONER PEGGY.</p>
<p class="date">December 1, 1801</p>
<div class="prelims">
<p class="indent">ERROR to the circuit court of Connecticut.</p>
<p class="indent">The schooner Peggy was captured as prize by the United States armed vessel, the Trumbull, David Jewitt, Esq. commander, instructed to take any armed vessel or vessels, sailing under the authority or pretence of authority of the French Republic. The capture was made upon the 24th of April 1800, and she was sent into the district of Connecticut, and was there libelled as prize. The district court ordered the schooner and cargo to be restored, and the captors appealed to the circuit court of the district of Connecticut for September 1800. The circuit court reversed the decree of the district court, and condemned the Peggy and cargo as prize. From this decree the owners of the Peggy prosecuted this writ of error.</p>
<p class="indent">On the 30th of September 1801 a convention between the United States and the French Republic was signed by the plenipotentiaries of the two nations at Paris, and on the 21st of December 1801 it was finally ratified by the president of the United States.</p>
<p class="indent">The fourth article of the convention provides that,</p>
<p class="indent">'Property captured, and not yet definitively condemned, or which may be captured before the exchange of ratifications (contraband goods destined to an enemy's port excepted) shall be mutually restored. This article shall take effect from the date of the signature of the present convention. And if, from the date of the said signature, any property shall be condemned contrary to the intent of the said convention, before the knowledge of this stipulation shall be obtained, the property so considered shall without delay be restored, or paid.'</p>
<p class="indent">The question to be decided by the court was, whether, by the sentence of the circuit court of Connecticut of September, the schooner Peggy could be considered as definitively condemned, within the meaning of the fourth article of the convention.</p>
<p class="center">[Pages 104-107 intentionally omitted]</p>
<p class="indent">Mr. Chief Justice MARSHALL delivered the opinion of the court.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p1">
<span class="num">1</span>
<p class="indent">In this case the court is of opinion that the schooner Peggy is within the provisions of the treaty entered into with France, and ought to be restored. This vessel is not considered as being definitively condemned. The argument at the bar which contends that because the sentence of the circuit court is denominated a final sentence, therefore its condemnation is definitive in the sense in which that term is used in the treaty, is not deemed a correct argument. A decree or sentence may be interlocutory or final in the court which pronounces it, and receives its appellation from its determining the power of that particular court over the subject to which it applies, or being only an intermediate order subject to the future control of the same court. The last decree of an inferior court is final in relation to the power of that court, but not in relation to the property itself, unless it be acquiesced under. The terms used in the treaty seem to apply to the actual condition of the property, and to direct a restoration of that which is still in controversy between the parties. On any other construction the word <i>definitive</i> would be rendered useless and inoperative. Vessels are seldom if ever condemned but by a final sentence. An interlocutory order for a sale is not a condemnation. A stipulation then for the restoration of vessels not yet condemned would, on this construction, comprehend as many cases as a stipulation for the restoration of such as are not yet definitively condemned. Every condemnation is final as to the court which pronounces it, and no other difference is perceived between a condemnation and a final condemnation, than that the one terminates definitively the controversy between the parties and the other leaves that controversy still depending. In this case the sentence of condemnation was appealed from. It might have been reversed, and therefore was not such a sentence as in the contemplation of the contracting parties, on a fair and honest construction of the contract, was designated as a definitive condemnation.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p2">
<span class="num">2</span>
<p class="indent">It has been urged that the court can take no notice of the stipulation for the restoration of property not yet definitively condemned, that the judges can only inquire whether the sentence was erroneous when delivered, and that if the judgment was correct it cannot be made otherwise by any thing subsequent to its rendition.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p3">
<span class="num">3</span>
<p class="indent">The constitution of the United States declares a treaty to be the supreme law of the land. Of consequence its obligation on the courts of the United States must be admitted. It is certainly true that the execution of a contract between nations is to be demanded from, and, in the general, superintended by the executive of each nation, and therefore whatever the decision of this court may be relative to the rights of parties litigating before it, the claim upon the nation, if unsatisfied, may still be asserted. But yet where a treaty is the law of the land, and as such affects the rights of parties litigating in court, that treaty as much binds those rights and is as much to be regarded by the court as an act of congress; and although restoration may be an executive, when viewed as a substantive act, independent of and unconnected with other circumstances, yet to condemn a vessel, the restoration of which is directed by a law of the land, would be a direct infraction of that law, and of consequence improper.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p4">
<span class="num">4</span>
<p class="indent">It is in the general true that the province of an appellate court is only to inquire whether a judgment when rendered was erroneous or not. But if subsequent to the judgment and before the decision of the appellate court, a law intervenes and positively changes the rule which governs, the law must be obeyed, or its obligation denied. If the law be constitutional, and of that no doubt in the present case has been expressed, I know of no court which can contest its obligation. It is true that in mere private cases between individuals, a court will and ought to struggle hard against a construction which will, by a retrospective operation, affect the rights of parties; but in great national concerns where individual rights acquired by war are sacrificed for national purposes, the contract making the sacrifice ought always to receive a construction conforming to its manifest import; and if the nation has given up the vested rights of its citizens, it is not for the court, but for the government, to consider whether it be a case proper for compensation. In such a case the court must decide according to existing laws, and if it be necessary to set aside a judgment, rightful when rendered, but which cannot be affirmed but in violation of law, the judgment must be set aside.</p>

<p>C. Lee and E.J. Lee, for the defendant.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*229</span> Feb. 23. The Chief Justice delivered the opinion of the court.</p>
<p>This is a writ of error to a judgment rendered in the circuit court of the district of Columbia, sitting in Alexandria, on the following case.</p>
<p>A charter-party was entered into between the parties on the tenth day of April, 1798, whereby Groverman let to Hooe &amp; Co. a vessel of which he was owner, for a voyage to Havre de Grace.</p>
<p>The first article states the indenture to witness, "that the said Groverman hath granted, and to freight letten, to the said R.T. Hooe &amp; Co. the brigantine Nancy, whereof he is owner, commanded by James Davidson, a citizen of the United States, now lying in the port of Alexandria, of the burden of 197 tons, or thereabouts; and for and in consideration of the covenants hereinafter mentioned, doth grant, and to freight let, unto the said R.T. Hooe &amp; Co. their executors and administrators, the whole tonnage of the aforesaid vessel called the Nancy, from the port of Alexandria, in Virginia, to the port of Havre de Grace, in France, and back to the said port of Alexandria, in a voyage to be made by the said R.T. Hooe &amp; Co. with the said brigantine, in manner hereinafter mentioned; that is to say, to sail with the *230 *first fair wind and weather that shall happen after she is completely laden, from the said port of Alexandria, with a cargo of tobacco to be shipped by said R.T. Hooe &amp; Co. to the said port of Havre de Grace, and there deliver the said cargo to Messrs. Andrews &amp; Co. of that town, merchants, or to their assigns, in good order, the danger of the seas only excepted; and at the said port of Havre de Grace to take on board a full <span class="star-pagination">*230</span> freight or lading of such goods as the said Andrews &amp; Co. may think proper to put on board said brigantine, as a return cargo, with which the said vessel is to make the rest of her way directly back to the port of Alexandria, and there safely deliver such cargo to the said R.T. Hooe &amp; Co."</p>
<p>Groverman further covenants with the said R.T. Hooe &amp; Co. that the vessel is, and shall during the voyage be kept, in good condition, and furnished with all manner of necessary and proper rigging, &amp;c. and with mariners to navigate her. He further covenants to allow twenty-five running days for lading the vessel at the port of Alexandria, thirty days for discharging her cargo and taking on board the return cargo at Havre, and ten days for receiving her inward cargo at Alexandria.</p>
<p>In consideration of these covenants, R.T. Hooe &amp; Co. engage to pay the stipulated freight, and 8l. 8s. for every day's demurrage, if any there should be by their default, at the port of Alexandria; and one hundred and fifty-one livres by the day for every day's demurrage, occasioned by their default at the port of Havre de Grace.</p>
<p>On the 11th day of April provisional articles were entered into between the same parties by which it was stipulated that,</p>
<p>1st. "The captain, or commander, shall be instructed by his owner, previous to his sailing from Alexandria, to touch at Falmouth in such manner as shall appear to his crew that there was a necessity for his so doing, there to lay off and on twenty-four hours (or longer if desired) in day light, during which time there will come off orders from Mr. Fox, the American consul, Mr. Thomas Wilson of London, or Messrs. Andrews &amp; Co. of Havre de Grace.</p>
<p>*2dly. "On receiving these orders the captain, or *231 commander, must proceed directly for Havre de Grace, London, Hamburg, Bremen or Rotterdam, as he may be directed, and at one of these ports deliver his cargo, to such person or persons as the aforesaid orders may direct."</p>
<p>The third and fourth articles apply the covenants of the charter-party, respecting the conduct of the vessel in the port of Havre, to the contingency of her being <span class="star-pagination">*231</span> ordered to some other port; and to the freight, and stipulate the demurrage to be 6l. 6s. sterling by the day.</p>
<p>The fifth article is in these words:</p>
<p>5th. "If the vessel is detained over twenty-four hours at Falmouth, demurrage shall be paid for the time at the rate stipulated in the charter-party." On the 20th of June, 1798, the vessel arrived in Falmouth roads, about three leagues from the port of Falmouth, where the master laid her to, and immediately went on shore, and applied to Mr. Fox, the American consul, for orders where to proceed. Fox replied that he had received no orders for him, and that, therefore, he must bring the vessel into the port of Falmouth, and there remain until orders were received for him to proceed to his port of discharge.</p>
<p>These orders were given to avoid the penalties of the British hovering act, which subjected to forfeiture the vessel and cargo if found in the situation in which the Nancy would have been, if she had waited for orders without entering the port. The captain immediately brought his vessel into port, where she was seized on suspicion of being French property, and detained for nearly three months.</p>
<p>After the seizure, on the 23d day of June, the captain received orders from Thomas Wilson, through Fox, to proceed with his vessel to London, there to deliver her cargo.</p>
<p>This suit is brought by Groverman to recover damages against R.T. Hooe &amp; Co. for this detention.</p>
<p>The declaration states the charter-party and provisional agreement, and then assigns a breach of them * 232 in these *words: "And the said plaintiff doth aver that the said brig arrived off Falmouth, on the 19th day of June, 1798, when the captain, by the orders of the aforesaid Mr. Fox, the agent of the said defendants, conveyed her into the port of Falmouth, by means whereof the said brig was detained in the aforesaid port of Falmouth more than twenty-four hours, to wit, from the 20th day of June last aforesaid, to the 11th day of September in the year 1798, when she sailed by the orders of Andrews &amp; Co. the agents for the said defendants, for the Downs." And the declaration then charges that the defendants had not paid <span class="star-pagination">*232</span> the demurrage stipulated in the charter-party, of in the provisional articles.</p>
<p>Issue was joined on the plea of conditions performed, and the jury found a special verdict, containing the facts already stated, and further, that before the vessel sailed from Alexandria the captain was told by R.T. Hooe, that on his arrival off Falmouth he would receive instructions from Mr. Fox, the American consul, and that he must abide by such instructions; and that it was by the default of the defendants or their agents in failing to have orders ready on the arrival of the said vessel off Falmouth as aforesaid, designating and directing to which of the ports of discharge mentioned in the second article of the provisional articles aforesaid the said vessel was to proceed, and by the orders given to the said Davidson, (the master,) by the said Mr. Fox, that the said Davidson did bring the said vessel to anchor in the said port of Falmouth, and that the said vessel and cargo were subjected to the seizure and detention aforesaid; if the law be for the plaintiff, the jury find 794l. 19s. 9d. Virginia currency, damages; if the law be for the defendants, then they find for the defendants.</p>
<p>The circuit court was of opinion that the law was for the plaintiff, and rendered judgment in his favour.</p>
<p>To support this judgment, the special verdict ought to show that R.T. Hooe &amp; Co. the defendants in the circuit court, have broken some covenant contained in the agreements between the parties; and that the breaches assigned in the declaration are upon the covenant so broken.</p>
<p>The breach assigned is the non-payment of demurrage * 233 stipulated to be paid, for a longer detention than twenty-four hours at Falmouth; and it is to be inquired whether the declaration makes a case showing demurrage to be demandable, and how far the special verdict sustains that case.</p>
<p>The case made by the declaration is,</p>
<p>That on the arrival of the vessel off Falmouth, the captain took her into port by order of Mr. Fox, by means whereof she was detained more than twenty-four hours.</p>
<p>The question arising out of this case, for the consideration of the court, is,</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*233</span> Does it show a breach of covenant on the part of R.T. Hooe &amp; Co. which subjects them to demurrage for the detention stated?</p>
<p>The fifth article is supposed to be broken. The words of the covenant are: "if the vessel is detained over 24 hours at Falmouth, demurrage shall be paid for the time, at the rate stipulated in the charter-party." If this clause provides for every detention whatever, however it may be occasioned, the inquiry is at an end, and the judgment should be affirmed. But on looking into the provisional articles, the general expressions here used will be found to be explained.</p>
<p>The first of these articles stipulates that the captain should touch at Falmouth, there to lay off and on for twenty-four hours (or longer if desired) in day light, during which time there will come off orders from Mr. Fox, the American consul, Mr. Thomas Wilson of London, or Messrs. Andrews &amp; Co. of Havre de Grace.</p>
<p>Here, then, is a power given to R.T. Hooe &amp; Co. to detain the vessel longer than twenty-four hours, lying off and on at the port of Falmouth, waiting for orders, and it is the only rational construction which can be given the contract to suppose that the fifth article refers to the first.</p>
<p>* 234 *A certain number of days are allowed for lading the vessel in Alexandria. But more days may be required, in which case demurrage is to be paid. So with respect to discharging and relading the vessel at the port of delivery in Europe; and so with respect to the return cargo in Alexandria: in each case demurrage is stipulated in the event of a longer detention than is agreed on.</p>
<p>When, then, a time is given to wait for orders at Falmouth, it is reasonable to suppose that the demurrage, which is to be paid, for a longer detention than the time given, relates to a detention occasioned by waiting for orders, or some breach of covenant by R.T. Hooe &amp; Co.</p>
<p>The declaration does not state the vessel to have waited, lying off and on, for orders, but to have been taken into port by the orders of Mr. Fox, when she was seized and detained by the officers of the British government.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*234</span> The covenant, then, was broken by taking the vessel into port, and it is to be inquired who is answerable for this breach.</p>
<p>It has been argued that R.T. Hooe &amp; Co. are answerable for it, because,</p>
<p>1. Their orders for the further prosecution of the voyage ought to have been in readiness as stipulated.</p>
<p>2. The vessel was taken into port by the orders of their agent, for whose acts they are accountable.</p>
<p>3. The captain was, for the voyage, their captain; and the stipulation to lay off and on, therefore, being broken by him, was broken by them.</p>
<p>To the first argument, founded on the non-reception of orders, the observation already made may be repeated. The declaration does not attribute the detention to that cause, but to a compliance with the orders of Fox in taking the vessel into port.</p>
<p>If, however, the charge in the declaration had been, that orders were not ready on the arrival of the vessel, *that charge would have been answered by the * 235 contract itself, which allows a delay of twenty-four hours for the reception of orders, without paying demurrage, and a longer time, if required, on paying therefor at the rate of 6l. 6s. sterling by the day.</p>
<p>The failure, then, to have the orders, for the further destination of the vessel, in readiness on the arrival of the captain, or even within the twenty-four hours after his arrival, was no breach of contract on the part of R.T. Hooe &amp; Co. since it was an event contemplated, and provided for, by the parties; and the question whether in the actual case which has happened, that is, of a delay longer than twenty-four hours in giving the orders, but of a seizure before that time elapsed, R.T. Hooe &amp; Co. are responsible for demurrage accruing between the termination of the twenty-four hours and the receipt of the orders, cannot be made in this case, because there is no allegation in the declaration which puts that fact in issue.</p>
<p>The court will proceed, then, to consider whether,</p>
<p>2dly. R.T. Hooe &amp; Co. are made accountable for the vessel's being taken into port, since that measure was adopted in pursuance of the instructions of their agent, Mr. Fox.</p>
<p>The finding of the jury goes far to prove that the defendants <span class="star-pagination">*235</span> in the court below have made themselves responsible for the conduct of Fox. They find that R.T. Hooe informed the captain before he sailed from Alexandria, that on his arrival off Falmouth, he would receive orders from Mr. Fox, and that he must abide by such instructions. This finding creates some difficulty in the case. But this communication from Mr. Hooe to the captain ought to be taken, it is conceived, in connection with the provisional articles. Those articles explain the nature of the orders to be received, and by which the captain was directed to abide. In them it is expressly stipulated that on receiving these instructions, the captain should proceed directly for Havre de Grace, London, Hamburg, Bremen or Rotterdam, as he should be directed. The orders, then, which he was to receive and obey, must be supposed * 236 compatible with this agreement. *This construction is the more reasonable, because, annexed to the provisional articles, is an acknowledgment on the part of the captain, that he was to act conformably to them. He ought not to have understood declarations of the kind stated in the verdict, as directing a departure from a written agreement entered into by the owner and freighters of the vessel, and to which he had bound himself to conform.</p>
<p>This article seems, too, to explain the power delegated by Hooe &amp; Co. to Fox; and to show that he was their agent for the purpose of directing the further destination of the vessel, but for no other purpose.</p>
<p>If this be the correct mode of understanding this part of the verdict, and it is believed to be so, then the particular conduct of Hooe &amp; Co. did not authorize the captain to obey the orders of the American consul in taking the vessel into port; nor are they responsible for the consequences of that measure, unless they could be considered as responsible for a violation of the covenant by the act of the captain.</p>
<p>If these facts are to be differently understood, and the communication made by Hooe to the captain is to be understood as authorizing him to obey any order given by Fox, though that order should be directly repugnant to the provisional articles, still the liability of Hooe &amp; Co. in this suit, will depend on the question whether the covenant to lay off and on at the port of Falmouth, <span class="star-pagination">*236</span> was a covenant on the part of the owner, or of the freighters, of the vessel. This depends so much on the question whether Groverman or R.T. Hooe &amp; Co. were owners of the vessel for the voyage, that it will more properly be considered with that point.</p>
<p>3. Was the captain under the direction of Groverman or Hooe &amp; Co. for the voyage?</p>
<p>This is to be determined by the whole charter-party, and the provisional articles taken together.</p>
<p>It has been observed at the bar, and the observation has considerable weight, that Groverman lets the tonnage of *the vessel, and not the whole vessel, to the *237 freighters. The expression of the charter-party, it will be perceived, varies in the part descriptive of the agreement, from what is used in the part constituting the written agreement. The indenture witnesses, "that the said Groverman hath granted, and to freight letten, to the said R.T. Hooe &amp; Co. the brigantine Nancy, whereof he is owner,' &amp;c. but immediately proceeds to say, "and for and in consideration of the covenants hereinafter mentioned, doth grant, and to freight let, to the said R.T. Hooe &amp; Co. the whole tonnage of the aforesaid vessel, from the port of Alexandria, in Virginia, to the port of Havre de Grace, in France," &amp;c. As the latter are the operative words which really constitute the contract, it is conceived that they ought to prevail in construing that contract. Groverman, then, has only let to Hooe &amp; Co. the tonnage of the vessel, and, therefore, is the less to be considered as having relinquished ownership of her during the voyage. There are other circumstances which serve to show that the direction of the vessel, during the voyage, was intended to remain with Groverman. The cargo is to be delivered to Messrs. Andrews &amp; Co. of Havre de Grace, in good order, the dangers of the seas only excepted. This is an undertaking on the part of Groverman, which he certainly would not have made if he had relinquished the direction of the voyage to Hooe &amp; Co. If the vessel pro hac vice, had been their vessel, Groverman would not have contracted for the delivery of the cargo; and for the delivery to a specified person.</p>
<p>If the freighters had owned and commanded the vessel, they might have delivered the cargo in Havre to any other person, or have discharged at a port short of Havre, <span class="star-pagination">*237</span> without injury to Groverman. So the cargo taken on board at Havre is to be such as Andrews &amp; Co. may think proper; which return cargo is to be delivered to Hooe &amp; Co. in Alexandria. These stipulations all indicate that the voyage was to be performed under the orders of Groverman, because the acts stipulated are to be done by him, and the covenants are his covenants.</p>
<p>This is further evidenced by the subsequent language of the charter-party. The succeeding sentence begins with the words, "And the said Groverman doth further *238 *covenant to and with the said R.T. Hooe &amp; Co." &amp;c. showing that the preceding covenants were all on the part of Groverman. This further covenant is not only for the present condition of the vessel, but that she shall be kept well apparelled and well manned by the said Groverman during the voyage. The captain, then, was Groverman's captain, the mariners were Groverman's mariners; and this furnishes an additional reason for supposing the captain and mariners to be under his direction.</p>
<p>After some further covenants on the part of Groverman, the charter-party proceeds thus: "In consideration whereof the said R.T. Hooe &amp; Co. do covenant, &amp;c. to and with the said W. Groverman, &amp;c. that they will well and truly pay the freight stipulated therein."</p>
<p>Thus the whole language of the charter-party goes to prove that the covenants respecting the voyage are on the part of Groverman, and on that account, as well as on the account of his letting only the tonnage of the vessel, and furnishing the captain and mariners, &amp;c. he is to be considered as the owner of the vessel for the voyage, under the charter-party. This opinion is strengthened rather than weakened by the provisional articles.</p>
<p>The first article stipulates that particular instructions respecting the voyage shall be given to the captain, by Groverman, before its commencement. The words are: "The captain or commander shall be instructed by his owner, previous to his sailing from the port of Alexandria, to touch at Falmouth," "there to lay off and on twenty-four hours (or longer if desired) in day light," &amp;c. These orders, then, to the captain were to be given by Groverman, and it was by his authority that the captain was to act on that occasion. This explains the <span class="star-pagination">*238</span> doubt as to the person who was to be considered as covenanting that the vessel should lay off and on, for twenty-four hours, at the port of Falmouth, and tends to show who was responsible for the breach of that covenant. This, too, is in addition to covenants in the charter-party, which are plainly Groverman's, and is therefore the more to be considered as a covenant on his part. The act was to be performed by his authority, and the covenant was his covenant.</p>
<p>*On a consideration, then, of the whole contract between *239 the parties, the court is of opinion that Groverman remained the owner of the vessel during the voyage, and is answerable for any misconduct of the captain.</p>
<p>The covenant to lay off and on at the port of Falmouth, being the covenant of Groverman, the freighters are not answerable in this action for the breach of it, should the orders of Fox be understood as their orders. It is probable that the course taken by the captain was the most prudent course; but were it otherwise, the orders of Fox might excuse the owner from any action brought by the freighters for loss sustained by them in consequence of going into Falmouth, but could not entitle him in this action against the freighters.</p>
<p>It is, then, the opinion of this court, that on this special verdict, the law is for the defendants.</p>
<p>Judgment reversed, and the circuit court to enter judgment for the defendants.</p>

<center><h1>UNITED STATES<br/>
v.<br/>
SIMMS.</h1></center>
<center><p><b>Supreme Court of United States.</b></p></center>
<center></center>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*253</span> Mason, attorney for the United States.</p>
<p>C. Lee, for the defendant.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*255</span> *Feb. 23d. The Chief Justice delivered the opinion *256 of the court.</p>
<p>This is a writ of error to a judgment of the circuit court of the district of Columbia, sitting in the county of Alexandria, in the following case.</p>
<p>By an act of the legislature of Virginia a penalty of 150 dollars is imposed on any person who permits certain games, enumerated in the act, to be played in a house of which he is the proprietor. The penalty, by that act, is given to any person who will sue for the same.</p>
<p>After the passage of this act, congress assumed the government of the district, and declared the laws of Maryland to remain in force in that part of the district which had been ceded by Maryland; and the laws of Virginia to remain in force in that part of the district which had been ceded by Virginia.</p>
<p>Subsequent to the act of assumption an act passed, supplementary to the act entitled "An act concerning the district of Columbia;" the second section of which is in these words: (here the Chief Justice read the whole section, and the substance of the indictment.)</p>
<p>It is admitted that, under the laws of Virginia, an indictment for this penalty could not be sustained; but it is contended that the clause in the supplemental act which has been recited, makes a new appropriation of the penalty, and gives a new remedy for its recovery.</p>
<p>It is insisted that the words "all fines, penalties and forfeitures accruing under the laws of Maryland and Virginia," &amp;c. necessarily include this penalty, and by giving a recovery in the name of the United States by indictment, appropriate the penalty to the public treasury. On the part of the defendant in error it is contended, <span class="star-pagination">*256</span> that the words relied on do not change the law further than to substitute in all actions heretofore carried on in the names of the states of Maryland and Virginia respectively, the name of the United States instead of those names; and that the provisions of the *257 act apply only to *fines, penalties and forfeitures accruing to the government.</p>
<p>This subject will perhaps receive some elucidation from a review of the two acts of congress relative to the district of Columbia.</p>
<p>The first section of the first act declaring that the laws of the two states respectively should remain in force in the parts of the territory ceded by each, was, perhaps, only declaratory of a principle which would have been in full operation without such declaration; yet it manifests very clearly an intention in congress not to take up the subject of a review of the laws of the district at that time, but to leave things as they then were, only adapting the existing laws to the new situation of the people.</p>
<p>Every remaining section of the act to the 16th, is employed on subjects where the mere change of government required the intervention of the general legislature.</p>
<p>The sixteenth section continues still to manifest a solicitude for the preservation of the existing state of things, so far as was compatible with the change of government, by declaring that nothing contained in the act should be construed to affect rights granted by, or derived from, the acts of incorporation of Alexandria and Georgetown, or of any body politic or corporate within the said district, except so far as relates to their judicial powers.</p>
<p>This act had given to the circuit court, which it established, cognisance of all crimes committed in the district, and of all penalties and forfeitures accruing under the laws of the United States.</p>
<p>It was soon perceived that the criminal jurisdiction of the court could not be exercised in one part of the district, because, by the laws of Virginia, persons guilty of any offence, less than murder in the first degree, were only punishable in the penitentiary house, erected in the city of Richmond, which punishment the court of Columbia could not inflict.</p>
<p>*258 *It was also perceived that some embarrasments would arise respecting the style in which suits, theretofore directed to be brought in the names of Maryland <span class="star-pagination">*258</span> and Virginia, should thenceforth be prosecuted. The respective laws authorizing them, and which were considered as having been re-enacted by congress, totidem verbis, directed such suits to be prosecuted in the names of Maryland and Virginia, respectively. The continuance of this style in the courts of the United States was glaringly improper, and it was thought necessary to change it by express provision. These objects rendered the supplemental act necessary, which provides, that the criminal law of Virginia, as it existed before the establishment of a penitentiary system, should continue in force, and that all indictments shall run in the name of the United States; and all fines, penalties and forfeitures, accruing under the laws of the states of Maryland and Virginia, shall be recovered with costs, &amp;c.</p>
<p>The residue of this supplemental act changes nothing, and only supplies provisions required by the revolution in government, and which had been omitted in the original act.</p>
<p>This view of the two acts would furnish strong reasons for supposing the object of congress to have been, not to change, in any respect, the existing laws further than the new situation of the district rendered indispensably necessary; and that the fines, penalties and forfeitures alluded to in the act, are those only which accrued by law, in the whole or in part, to government; and for the recovery of which the remedy was by indictment or information, in the name of the state in which the court sat, or by a qui tam action in which the name of the state was to be used. It cannot be presumed that congress could have intended to use the words in the unlimited sense contended for.</p>
<p>By the laws of Virginia, an officer is liable to a heavy fine for not returning an execution which came to his hands to be served, or for retaining in his hands money levied on such execution. This goes to the party injured, and on his motion the judgment for the fine is to be rendered. It would be going a great way to construe this act *of congress as making such a fine recoverable for the *259 use of the United States; and yet, this would be the consequence of construing it to extend to fines and penalties accruing by law, not to government, but to individuals.</p>
<p>If a penalty recoverable by any individual, by action <span class="star-pagination">*259</span> of debt, was to be considered as designed to be embraced by the second section of the supplemental act, still an action of debt in the name of the United States and of the informer, would seem to be the remedy given by the act.</p>
<p>The principle, reddenda singula singulis, would be applicable; and it would seem to the court more proper to suppose the qui tam action, given in this case, to be the remedy, than an indictment.</p>
<p>The court, therefore, is of opinion, that there is no error in the judgment, and that it be affirmed.<sup>[(a)]</sup></p>
<h2>NOTES</h2>
<p>[(a)]  The defendant's counsel prayed that the affirmance might be with costs. It was suggested by some of the gentlemen of the bar, that the question of giving costs against the United States would be fully argued in the case of The United States v. Hooe, at this term. The court, therefore, postponed the subject till that argument should be had. That cause, however, went off upon another ground, without any argument on the question of costs. And the court did not give any directions respecting the costs in the present case.</p>

<center><h1>WILLIAM MARBURY<br/>
v.<br/>
JAMES MADISON, SECRETARY OF STATE OF THE UNITED STATES.</h1></center>
<center><p><b>Supreme Court of United States.</b></p></center>
<center></center>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*153</span> Opinion of the Court.</p>
<p>At the last term on the affidavits then read and filed with the clerk, a rule was granted in this case, requiring the secretary of state to show cause why a mandamus *154 *should not issue, directing him to deliver to William Marbury his commission as a justice of the peace for the county of Washington, in the district of Columbia.</p>
<p>No cause has been shown, and the present motion is for a mandamus. The peculiar delicacy of this case, the novelty of some of its circumstances, and the real difficulty attending the points which occur in it, require a complete exposition of the principles on which the opinion to be given by the court is founded.</p>
<p>These principles have been, on the side of the applicant, very ably argued at the bar. In rendering the opinion of the court, there will be some departure in form, though not in substance, from the points stated in that argument.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*154</span> In the order in which the court has viewed this subject, the following questions have been considered and decided.</p>
<p>1st. Has the applicant a right to the commission he demands?</p>
<p>2dly. If he has a right, and that right has been violated, do the laws of his country afford him a remedy?</p>
<p>3dly. If they do afford him a remedy, is it a mandamus issuing from this court?</p>
<p>The first object of inquiry is,</p>
<p>1st. Has the applicant a right to the commission he demands?</p>
<p>His right originates in an act of congress passed in February, 1801, concerning the district of Columbia.</p>
<p>After dividing the district into two counties, the 11th section of this law enacts, "that there shall be appointed in and for each of the said counties, such number of discreet persons to be justices of the peace as the president of the United States shall, from time to time, think expedient, to continue in office for five years.</p>
<p>*It appears, from the affidavits, that in compliance with *155 this law, a commission for William Marbury, as a justice of peace for the county of Washington, was signed by John Adams, then President of the United States; after which the seal of the United States was affixed to it; but the commission has never reached the person for whom it was made out.</p>
<p>In order to determine whether he is entitled to this commission, it becomes necessary to inquire whether he has been appointed to the office. For if he has been appointed, the law continues him in office for five years, and he is entitled to the possession of those evidences of office, which, being completed, became his property.</p>
<p>The 2d section of the 2d article of the constitution declares, that "the president shall nominate, and, by and with the advice and consent of the senate, shall appoint, ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, and all other officers of the United States, whose appointments are not otherwise provided for."</p>
<p>The 3d section declares, that "he shall commission all the officers of the United States."</p>
<p>An act of congress directs the secretary of state to keep the seal of the United States, "to make out and record, and affix the said seal to all civil commissions <span class="star-pagination">*155</span> to officers of the United States, to be appointed by the president, by and with the consent of the senate, or by the president alone; provided, that the said seal shall not be affixed to any commission before the same shall have been signed by the President of the United States."</p>
<p>These are the clauses of the constitution and laws of the United States, which affect this part of the case. They seem to contemplate three distinct operations:</p>
<p>1st. The nomination. This is the sole act of the president, and is completely voluntary.</p>
<p>2d. The appointment. This is also the act of the president, and is also a voluntary act, though it can only be performed by and with the advice and consent of the senate.</p>
<p>*156 *3d. The commission. To grant a commission to a person appointed, might, perhaps, be deemed a duty enjoined by the constitution. "He shall," says that instrument, "commission all the officers of the United States."</p>
<p>The acts of appointing to office, and commissioning the person appointed, can scarcely be considered as one and the same; since the power to perform them is given in two separate and distinct sections of the constitution. The distinction between the appointment and the commission will be rendered more apparent by adverting to that provision in the second section of the second article of the constitution, which authorizes congress "to vest, by law, the appointment of such inferior officers, as they think proper, in the president alone, in the courts of law, or in the heads of departments;" thus contemplating cases where the law may direct the president to commission an officer appointed by the courts, or by the heads of departments. In such a case, to issue a commission would be apparently a duty distinct from the appointment, the performance of which, perhaps, could not legally be refused.</p>
<p>Although that clause of the constitution which requires the president to commission all the officers of the United States, may never have been applied to officers appointed otherwise than by himself, yet it would be difficult to deny the legislative power to apply it to such cases. Of consequence, the constitutional distinction between the appointment to an office and the commission of an officer who has been appointed, remains the same <span class="star-pagination">*156</span> as if in practice the president had commissioned officers appointed by an authority other than his own.</p>
<p>It follows, too, from the existence of this distinction, that if an appointment was to be evidenced by any public act, other than the commission, the performance of such public act would create the officer; and if he was not removable at the will of the president, would either give him a right to his commission, or enable him to perform the duties without it.</p>
<p>These observations are premised solely for the purpose of rendering more intelligible those which apply more directly to the particular case under consideration.</p>
<p>*This is an appointment made by the president, by and *157 with the advice and consent of the senate, and is evidenced by no act but the commission itself. In such a case, therefore, the commission and the appointment seem inseparable; it being almost impossible to show an appointment otherwise than by proving the existence of a commission; still the commission is not necessarily the appointment, though conclusive evidence of it.</p>
<p>But at what stage does it amount to this conclusive evidence?</p>
<p>The answer to this question seems an obvious one. The appointment being the sole act of the president, must be completely evidenced, when it is shown that he has done every thing to be performed by him.</p>
<p>Should the commission, instead of being evidence of an appointment, even be considered as constituting the appointment itself; still it would be made when the last act to be done by the president was performed, or, at furthest, when the commission was complete.</p>
<p>The last act to be done by the president is the signature of the commission. He has then acted on the advice and consent of the senate to his own nomination. The time for deliberation has then passed. He has decided. His judgment, on the advice and consent of the senate concurring with his nomination, has been made, and the officer is appointed. This appointment is evidenced by an open, unequivocal act; and being the last act required from the person making it, necessarily excludes the idea of its being, so far as respects the appointment, an inchoate and incomplete transaction.</p>
<p>Some point of time must be taken when the power of the executive over an officer, not removable at his will, <span class="star-pagination">*157</span> must cease. That point of time must be when the constitutional power of appointment has been exercised. And this power has been exercised when the last act, required from the person possessing the power, has been performed. This last act is the signature of the commission. This idea seems to have prevailed with the legislature, when the act passed converting the department *158 *of foreign affairs into the department of state. By that act it is enacted, that the secretary of state shall keep the seal of the United States, "and shall make out and record, and shall affix the said seal to all civil commissions to officers of the United States, to be appointed by the president;" "Provided, that the said seal shall not be affixed to any commission before the same shall have been signed by the President of the United States; nor to any other instrument or act, without the special warrant of the president therefor."</p>
<p>The signature is a warrant for affixing the great seal to the commission; and the great seal is only to be affixed to an instrument which is complete. It attests, by an act supposed to be of public notoriety, the verity of the presidential signature.</p>
<p>It is never to be affixed till the commission is signed, because the signature, which gives force and effect to the commission, is conclusive evidence that the appointment is made.</p>
<p>The commission being signed, the subsequent duty of the secretary of state is prescribed by law, and not to be guided by the will of the president. He is to affix the seal of the United States to the commission, and is to record it.</p>
<p>This is not a proceeding which may be varied, if the judgment of the executive shall suggest one more eligible; but is a precise course accurately marked out by law, and is to be strictly pursued. It is the duty of the secretary of state to conform to the law, and in this he is an officer of the United States, bound to obey the laws. He acts, in this respect, as has been very properly stated at the bar, under the authority of law, and not by the instructions of the president. It is a ministerial act which the law enjoins on a particular officer for a particular purpose.</p>
<p>If it should be supposed, that the solemnity of affixing the seal is necessary not only to the validity of the commission, <span class="star-pagination">*158</span> but even to the completion of an appointment, still when the seal is affixed the appointment is made, and *the commission is valid. No other solemnity is required *159 by law; no other act is to be performed on the part of government. All that the executive can do to invest the person with his office is done; and unless the appointment be then made, the executive cannot make one without the coÃ¶peration of others.</p>
<p>After searching anxiously for the principles on which a contrary opinion may be supported, none have been found which appear of sufficient force to maintain the opposite doctrine.</p>
<p>Such as the imagination of the court could suggest, have been very deliberately examined, and after allowing them all the weight which it appears possible to give them, they do not shake the opinion which has been formed.</p>
<p>In considering this question, it has been conjectured that the commission may have been assimilated to a deed, to the validity of which delivery is essential.</p>
<p>This idea is founded on the supposition that the commission is not merely evidence of an appointment, but is itself the actual appointment; a supposition by no means unquestionable. But for the purpose of examining this objection fairly, let it be conceded, that the principle claimed for its support is established.</p>
<p>The appointment being, under the constitution, to be made by the president personally, the delivery of the deed of appointment, if necessary to its completion, must be made by the president also. It is not necessary that the delivery should be made personally to the grantee of the office: it never is so made. The law would seem to contemplate that it should be made to the secretary of state, since it directs the secretary to affix the seal to the commission after it shall have been signed by the president. If, then, the act of livery be necessary to give validity to the commission, it has been delivered when executed and given to the secretary for the purpose of being sealed, recorded, and transmitted to the party.</p>
<p>But in all cases of letters patent, certain solemnities are required by law, which solemnities are the evidences *of the validity of the instrument. A formal *160 delivery to the person is not among them. In cases <span class="star-pagination">*160</span> of commissions, the sign manual of the president, and the seal of the United States, are those solemnities. This objection, therefore, does not touch the case.</p>
<p>It has also occurred as possible, and barely possible, that the transmission of the commission, and the acceptance thereof, might be deemed necessary to complete the right of the plaintiff.</p>
<p>The transmission of the commission is a practice directed by convenience, but not by law. It cannot, therefore, be necessary to constitute the appointment which must precede it, and which is the mere act of the president. If the executive required that every person appointed to an office should himself take means to procure his commission, the appointment would not be the less valid on that account. The appointment is the sole act of the president; the transmission of the commission is the sole act of the officer to whom that duty is assigned, and may be accelerated or retarded by circumstances which can have no influence on the appointment. A commission is transmitted to a person already appointed; not to a person to be appointed or not, as the letter enclosing the commission should happen to get into the post-office and reach him in safety, or to miscarry.</p>
<p>It may have some tendency to elucidate this point, to inquire whether the possession of the original commission be indispensably necessary to authorize a person, appointed to any office, to perform the duties of that office. If it was necessary, then a loss of the commission would lose the office. Not only negligence, but accident or fraud, fire or theft, might deprive an individual of his office. In such a case, I presume it could not be doubted but that a copy from the record of the office of the secretary of state would be, to every intent and purpose, equal to the original. The act of congress has expressly made it so. To give that copy validity, it would not be necessary to prove that the original had been transmitted and afterwards lost. The copy would be complete evidence that the original had existed, and that the appointment had been made, but not that the original had been transmitted. If indeed it should appear that *161 *the original had been mislaid in the office of state, that circumstance would not affect the operation of the <span class="star-pagination">*161</span> copy. When all the requisites have been performed which authorize a recording officer to record any instrument whatever, and the order for that purpose has been given, the instrument is, in law, considered as recorded, although the manual labour of inserting it in a book kept for that purpose may not have been performed.</p>
<p>In the case of commissions, the law orders the secretary of state to record them. When, therefore, they are signed and sealed, the order for their being recorded is given; and whether inserted in the book or not, they are in law recorded.</p>
<p>A copy of this record is declared equal to the original, and the fees to be paid by a person requiring a copy are ascertained by law. Can a keeper of a public record erase therefrom a commission which has been recorded? Or can he refuse a copy thereof to a person demanding it on the terms prescribed by law?</p>
<p>Such a copy would, equally with the original, authorize the justice of peace to proceed in the performance of his duty, because it would, equally with the original, attest his appointment.</p>
<p>If the transmission of a commission be not considered as necessary to give validity to an appointment, still less is its acceptance. The appointment is the sole act of the president; the acceptance is the sole act of the officer, and is, in plain common sense, posterior to the appointment. As he may resign, so may he refuse to accept: but neither the one nor the other is capable of rendering the appointment a non-entity.</p>
<p>That this is the understanding of the government, is apparent from the whole tenor of its conduct.</p>
<p>A commission bears date, and the salary of the officer commences, from his appointment; not from the transmission or acceptance of his commission. When a person appointed to any office refuses to accept that office, the successor is nominated in the place of the person who *has declined to accept, and not in the place *162 of the person who had been previously in office, and had created the original vacancy.</p>
<p>It is, therefore, decidedly the opinion of the court, <span class="star-pagination">*162</span> that when a commission has been signed by the president, the appointment is made; and that the commission is complete when the seal of the United States has been affixed to it by the secretary of state.</p>
<p>Where an officer is removable at the will of the executive, the circumstance which completes his appointment is of no concern; because the act is at any time revocable; and the commission may be arrested, if still in the office. But when the officer is not removable at the will of the executive, the appointment is not revocable, and cannot be annulled. It has conferred legal rights which cannot be resumed.</p>
<p>The discretion of the executive is to be exercised until the appointment has been made. But having once made the appointment, his power over the office is terminated in all cases, where by law the officer is not removable by him. The right to the office is then in the person appointed, and he has the absolute, unconditional power of accepting or rejecting it.</p>
<p>Mr. Marbury, then, since his commission was signed by the president, and sealed by the secretary of state, was appointed; and as the law creating the office, gave the officer a right to hold for five years, independent of the executive, the appointment was not revocable, but vested in the officer legal rights, which are protected by the laws of his country.</p>
<p>To withhold his commission, therefore, is an act deemed by the court not warranted by law, but violative of a vested legal right.</p>
<p>This brings us to the second inquiry; which is,</p>
<p>2dly. If he has a right, and that right has been violated, do the laws of his country afford him a remedy?</p>
<p>*163 *The very essence of civil liberty certainly consists in the right of every individual to claim the protection of the laws, whenever he receives an injury. One of the first duties of government is to afford that protection. In Great Britain the king himself is sued in the respectful form of a petition, and he never fails to comply with the judgment of his court.</p>
<p>In the 3d vol. of his Commentaries, p. 23. Blackstone states two cases in which a remedy is afforded by mere operation of law.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*163</span> In all other cases," he says, "it is a general and indisputable rule, that where there is a legal right, there is also a legal remedy by suit, or action at law, when ever that right is invaded."</p>
<p>And afterwards, p. 109. of the same vol. he says, "I am next to consider such injuries as are cognisable by the courts of the common law. And herein I shall for the present only remark, that all possible injuries whatsoever, that did not fall within the exclusive cognisance of either the ecclesiastical, military, or maritime tribunals, are, for that very reason, within the cognisance of the common law courts of justice; for it is a settled and invariable principle in the laws of England that every right, when withheld, must have a remedy, and every injury its proper redress."</p>
<p>The government of the United States has been emphatically termed a government of laws, and not of men. It will certainly cease to deserve this high appellation, if the laws furnish no remedy for the violation of a vested legal right.</p>
<p>If this obloquy is to be cast on the jurisprudence of our country, it must arise from the peculiar character of the case.</p>
<p>It behoves us, then, to inquire whether there be in its composition any ingredient which shall exempt it from legal investigation, or exclude the injured party from legal redress. In pursuing this inquiry the first question which presents itself is, whether this can be arranged *with that class of cases which come under the *164 description of damnum absque injuria; a loss without an injury.</p>
<p>This description of cases never has been considered, and it is believed never can be considered, as comprehending offices of trust, of honour, or of profit. The office of justice of peace in the district of Columbia is such an office; it is therefore worthy of the attention and guardianship of the laws. It has received that attention and guardianship. It has been created by special act of congress, and has been secured, so far as the laws can give security, to the person appointed to fill it, for five years. It is not, then, on account of the worthlessness of the thing pursued, that the injured party can be alleged to be without remedy.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*164</span> Is it in the nature of the transaction? Is the act of delivering or withholding a commission to be considered as a mere political act, belonging to the executive department alone, for the performance of which entire confidence is place by our constitution in the supreme executive; and for any misconduct respecting which, the injured individual has no remedy?</p>
<p>That there may be such cases is not to be questioned; but that every act of duty, to be performed in any of the great departments of government, constitutes such a case, is not to be admitted.</p>
<p>By the act concerning invalids, passed in June, 1794, vol. 3. p. 112. the secretary at war is ordered to place on the pension list all persons whose names are contained in a report previously made by him to congress. If he should refuse to do so, would the wounded veteran be without remedy? Is it to be contended that where the law in precise terms, directs the performance of an act, in which an individual is interested, the law is incapable of securing obedience to its mandate? Is it on account of the character of the person against whom the complaint is made? Is it to be contended that the heads of departments are not amenable to the laws of their country?</p>
<p>Whatever the practice on particular occasions may be, the theory of this principle will certainly never be *165 maintained. *No act of the legislature confers so extraordinary a privilege, nor can it derive countenance from the doctrines of the common law. After stating that personal injury from the king to a subject is presumed to be impossible, Blackstone, vol. 3. p. 255. says, "but injuries to the rights of property can scarcely be committed by the crown without the intervention of its officers; for whom the law, in matters of right, entertains no respect or delicacy; but furnishes various methods of detecting the errors and misconduct of those agents, by whom the king has been deceived and induced to do a temporary injustice."</p>
<p>By the act passed in 1796, authorizing the sale of the lands above the mouth of Kentucky river, (vol. 3.p. 299.) the purchaser, on paying his purchase-money, becomes completely entitled to the property purchased; and on producing to the secretary of state the receipt of the <span class="star-pagination">*165</span> treasurer upon a certificate required by the law, the President of the United States is authorized to grant him a patent. It is further enacted that all patents shall be countersigned by the secretary of state, and recorded in the office. If the secretary of state should choose to withhold this patent; or, the patent being lost, should refuse a copy of it; can it be imagined that the law furnishes to the injured person no remedy?</p>
<p>It is not believed that any person whatever would attempt to maintain such a proposition.</p>
<p>It follows, then, that the question, whether the legality of an act of the head of a department be examinable in a court of justice or not, must always depend on the nature of that act.</p>
<p>If some acts be examinable, and others not, there must be some rule of law to guide the court in the exercise of its jurisdiction.</p>
<p>In some instances there may be difficulty in applying the rule to particular cases; but there cannot, it is believed, be much difficulty in laying down the rule.</p>
<p>By the constitution of the United States, the president is invested with certain important political powers, in the *exercise of which he is to use his own discretion, and is *166 accountable only to his country in his political character and to his own conscience. To aid him in the performance of these duties, he is authorized to appoint certain officers, who act by his authority, and in conformity with his orders.</p>
<p>In such cases, their acts are his acts; and whatever opinion may be entertained of the manner in which executive discretion may be used, still there exists, and can exist, no power to control that discretion. The subjects are political. They respect the nation, not individual rights, and being intrusted to the executive, the decision of the executive is conclusive. The application of this remark will be perceived by adverting to the act of congress for establishing the department of foreign affairs. This officer, as his duties were prescribed by that act, is to conform precisely to the will of the president. He is the mere organ by whom that will is communicated. The acts of such an officer, as an officer, can never be examinable by the courts.</p>
<p>But when the legislature proceeds to impose on that officer other duties: when he is directed peremptorily to <span class="star-pagination">*166</span> perform certain acts; when the rights of individuals are dependent on the performance of those acts; he is so far the officer of the law; is amenable to the laws for his conduct; and cannot at his discretion sport away the vested rights of others.</p>
<p>The conclusion from this reasoning is, that where the heads of departments are the political or confidential agents of the executive, merely to execute the will of the president, or rather to act in cases in which the executive possesses a constitutional or legal discretion, nothing can be more perfectly clear than that their acts are only politically examinable. But where a specific duty is assigned by law, and individual rights depend upon the performance of that duty, it seems equally clear that the individual who considers himself injured, has a right to resort to the laws of his country for a remedy.</p>
<p>If this be the rule, let us inquire how it applies to the case under the consideration of the court.</p>
<p>*167 *The power of nominating to the senate, and the power of appointing the person nominated, are political powers, to be exercised by the president according to his own discretion. When he has made an appointment, he has exercised his whole power, and his discretion has been completely applied to the case. If, by law, the officer be removable at the will of the president, then a new appointment may be immediately made, and the rights of the officer are terminated. But as a fact which has existed cannot be made never to have existed, the appointment cannot be annihilated; and, consequently, if the officer is by law not removable at the will of the president, the rights he has acquired are protected by the law, and are not resumable by the president. They cannot be extinguished by executive authority, and he has the privilege of asserting them in like manner as if they had been derived from any other source.</p>
<p>The question whether a right has vested or not, is, in its nature, judicial, and must be tried by the judicial authority. If, for example, Mr. Marbury had taken the oaths of a magistrate, and proceeded to act as one; in consequence of which a suit had been instituted against him, in which his defence had depended on his being a magistrate, the validity of his appointment must have been determined by judicial authority.</p>
<p>So, if he conceives that, by virtue of his appointment, <span class="star-pagination">*167</span> he has a legal right either to the commission which has been made out for him, or to a copy of that commission, it is equally a question examinable in a court, and the decision of the court upon it must depend on the opinion entertained of his appointment.</p>
<p>That question has been discussed, and the opinion is, that the latest point of time which can be taken as that at which the appointment was complete, and evidenced, was when, after the signature of the president, the seal of the United States was affixed to the commission.</p>
<p>It is, then, the opinion of the court,</p>
<p>1st. That by signing the commission of Mr. Marbury, the President of the United States appointed him a justice *of peace for the county of Washington, in the district *168 of Columbia; and that the seal of the United States, affixed thereto by the secretary of state, is conclusive testimony of the verity of the signature, and of the completion of the appointment; and that the appointment conferred on him a legal right to the office for the space of five years.</p>
<p>2dly. That, having this legal title to the office, he has a consequent right to the commission; a refusal to deliver which is a plain violation of that right, for which the laws of his country afford him a remedy.</p>
<p>It remains to be inquired whether,</p>
<p>3dly. He is entitled to the remedy for which he applies. This depends on,</p>
<p>1st. The nature of the writ applied for; and,</p>
<p>2dly. The power of this court.</p>
<p>1st. The nature of the writ.</p>
<p>Blackstone, in the 3d volume of his Commentaries, page 110. defines a mandamus to be "a command issuing in the king's name from the court of king's bench, and directed to any person, corporation, or inferior court of judicature within the king's dominions, requiring them to do some particular thing therein specified, which appertains to their office and duty, and which the court of king's bench has previously determined, or at least supposes, to be consonant to right and justice."</p>
<p>Lord Mansfield, in 3 Burrow, 1266. in the case of The King v. Baker et al., states, with much precision and explicitness the cases in which this writ may be used.</p>
<p>"Whenever," says that very able judge, "there is a right to execute an office, perform a service, or exercise <span class="star-pagination">*168</span> a franchise, (more especially if it be in a matter of public concern, or attended with profit,) and a person is kept out of possession, or dispossessed of such right, and *169 *has no other specific legal remedy, this court ought to assist by mandamus, upon reasons of justice, as the writ expresses, and upon reasons of public policy, to preserve peace, order and good government." In the same case he says, "this writ ought to be used upon all occasions where the law has established no specific remedy, and where in justice and good government there ought to be one."</p>
<p>In addition to the authorities now particularly cited, many others were relied on at the bar, which show how far the practice has conformed to the general doctrines that have been just quoted.</p>
<p>This writ, if awarded, would be directed to an officer of government, and its mandate to him would be, to use the words of Blackstone, "to do a particular thing therein specified, which appertains to his office and duty, and which the court has previously determined, or at least supposes, to be consonant to right and justice." Or, in the words of Lord Mansfield, the applicant, in this case, has a right to execute an office of public concern, and is kept out of possession of that right.</p>
<p>These circumstances certainly concur in this case.</p>
<p>Still, to render the mandamus a proper remedy, the officer to whom it is to be directed, must be one to whom, on legal principles, such writ may be directed; and the person applying for it must be without any other specific and legal remedy.</p>
<p>1st. With respect to the officer to whom it would be directed. The intimate political relation subsisting between the President of the United States and the heads of departments, necessarily renders any legal investigation of the acts of one of those high officers peculiarly irksome, as well as delicate; and excites some hesitation with respect to the propriety of entering into such investigation. Impressions are often received without much reflection or examination, and it is not wonderful that in such a case as this the assertion, by an individual, of his legal claims in a court of justice, to which claims it is the duty of that court to *170 attend, should at first view be considered *by some, <span class="star-pagination">*170</span> as an attempt to intrude into the cabinet, and to inter-meddle with the prerogatives of the executive.</p>
<p>It is scarcely necessary for the court to disclaim all pretensions to such a jurisdiction. An extravagance, so absurd and excessive, could not have been entertained for a moment. The province of the court is, solely, to decide on the rights of individuals, not to inquire how the executive, or executive officers, perform duties in which they have a discretion. Questions in their nature political, or which are, by the constitution and laws, submitted to the executive, can never be made in this court.</p>
<p>But, if this be not such a question; if, so far from being an intrusion into the secrets of the cabinet, it respects a paper which, according to law, is upon record, and to a copy of which the law gives a right, on the payment of ten cents; if it be no intermeddling with a subject over which the executive can be considered as having exercised any control; what is there in the exalted station of the officer, which shall bar a citizen from asserting, in a court of justice, his legal rights, or shall forbid a court to listen to the claim, or to issue a mandamus, directing the performance of a duty, not depending on executive discretion, but on particular acts of congress, and the general principles of law?</p>
<p>If one of the heads of departments commits any illegal act, under colour of his office, by which an individual sustains an injury, it cannot be pretended that his office alone exempts him from being sued in the ordinary mode of proceeding, and being compelled to obey the judgment of the law. How, then, can his office exempt him from this particular mode of deciding on the legality of his conduct, if the case be such a case as would, were any other individual the party complained of, authorize the process?</p>
<p>It is not by the office of the person to whom the writ is directed, but the nature of the thing to be done, that the propriety or impropriety of issuing a mandamus is to be determined. Where the head of a department acts in a case, in which executive discretion is to be exercised; in which he is the mere organ of executive will; it is *again repeated, that any application *171 <span class="star-pagination">*171</span> to a court to control, in any respect, his conduct would be rejected without hesitation.</p>
<p>But where he is directed by law to do a certain act affecting the absolute rights of individuals, in the performance of which he is not placed under the particular direction of the president, and the performance of which the president cannot lawfully forbid, and therefore is never presumed to have forbidden; as for example, to record a commission, or a patent for land, which has received all the legal solemnities; or to give a copy of such record; in such cases, it is not perceived on what ground the courts of the country are further excused from the duty of giving judgment that right be done to an injured individual, than if the same services were to be performed by a person not the head of a department.</p>
<p>This opinion seems not now, for the first time, to be taken up in this country.</p>
<p>It must be well recollected that in 1792, an act passed, directing the secretary at war to place on the pension list such disabled officers and soldiers as should be reported to him, by the circuit courts, which act, so far as the duty was imposed on the courts, was deemed unconstitutional; but some of the judges thinking that the law might be executed by them in the character of commissioners, proceeded to act, and to report in that character.</p>
<p>This law being deemed unconstitutional at the circuits, was repealed, and a different system was established; but the question whether those persons who had been reported by the judges, as commissioners, were entitled, in consequence of that report, to be placed on the pension list, was a legal question, properly determinable in the courts, although the act of placing such persons on the list was to be performed by the head of a department.</p>
<p>That this question might be properly settled, congress passed an act in February, 1793, making it the duty of the secretary of war, in conjunction with the attorney-general, to take such measures as might be necessary to obtain an adjudication of the supreme *172 court of the United *States on the validity of any such rights, claimed under the act aforesaid.</p>
<p>After the passage of this act, a mandamus was moved <span class="star-pagination">*172</span> for, to be directed to the secretary at war, commanding him to place on the pension list, a person stating himself to be on the report of the judges.</p>
<p>There is, therefore, much reason to believe, that this mode of trying the legal right of the complainant was deemed by the head of a department, and by the highest law officer of the United States, the most proper which could be selected for the purpose.</p>
<p>When the subject was brought before the court, the decision was, not that a mandamus would not lie to the head of a department directing him to perform an act, enjoined by law, in the performance of which an individual had a vested interest; but that a mandamus ought not to issue in that case; the decision necessarily to be made if the report of the commissioners did not confer on the applicant a legal right.</p>
<p>The judgment, in that case, is understood to have decided the merits of all claims of that description; and the persons, on the report of the commissioners, found it necessary to pursue the mode prescribed by the law subsequent to that which had been deemed unconstitutional, in order to place themselves on the pension list.</p>
<p>The doctrine, therefore, now advanced, is by no means a novel one.</p>
<p>It is true that the mandamus, now moved for, is not for the performance of an act expressly enjoined by statute.</p>
<p>It is to deliver a commission; on which subject the acts of congress are silent. This difference is not considered as affecting the case. It has already been stated that the applicant has, to that commission, a vested legal right, of which the executive cannot deprive him. He has been appointed to an office, from which he is not removable at the will of the executive; and being so *appointed, he has a right to the *173 commission which the secretary has received from the president for his use. The act of congress does not indeed order the secretary of state to send it to him, but it is placed in his hands for the person entitled to it; and cannot be more lawfully withheld by him than by any other person.</p>
<p>It was at first doubted whether the action of detinue was not a specific legal remedy for the commission which <span class="star-pagination">*173</span> has been withheld from Mr. Marbury; in which case a mandamus would be improper. But this doubt has yielded to the consideration that the judgment in detinue is for the thing itself, or its value. The value of a public office not to be sold is incapable of being ascertained; and the applicant has a right to the office itself, or to nothing. He will obtain the office by obtaining the commission, or a copy of it from the record.</p>
<p>This, then, is a plain case for a mandamus, either to deliver the commission, or a copy of it from the record; and it only remains to be inquired,</p>
<p>Whether it can issue from this court.</p>
<p>The act to establish the judicial courts of the United States authorizes the supreme court "to issue writs of mandamus, in cases warranted by the principles and usages of law, to any courts appointed, or persons holding office, under the authority of the United States."</p>
<p>The secretary of state, being a person holding an office under the authority of the United States, is precisely within the letter of the description; and if this court is not authorized to issue a writ of mandamus to such an officer, it must be because the law is unconstitutional, and therefore absolutely incapable of conferring the authority, and assigning the duties which its words purport to confer and assign.</p>
<p>The constitution vests the whole judicial power of the United States in one supreme court, and such inferior courts as congress shall, from time to time, ordain and establish. This power is expressly extended to all cases arising under the laws of the United States; and, consequently, in some form, may be exercised over *174 the present *case; because the right claimed is given by a law of the United States.</p>
<p>In the distribution of this power it is declared that "the supreme court shall have original jurisdiction in all cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, and those in which a state shall be a party. In all other cases, the supreme court shall have appellate jurisdiction."</p>
<p>It has been insisted, at the bar, that as the original grant of jurisdiction, to the supreme and inferior courts, is general, and the clause, assigning original jurisdiction to the supreme court, contains no negative or restrictive words, the power remains to the legislature, <span class="star-pagination">*174</span> to assign original jurisdiction to that court in other cases than those specified in the article which has been recited; provided those cases belong to the judicial power of the United States.</p>
<p>If it had been intended to leave it in the discretion of the legislature to apportion the judicial power between the supreme and inferior courts according to the will of that body, it would certainly have been useless to have proceeded further than to have defined the judicial power, and the tribunals in which it should be vested. The subsequent part of the section is mere surplusage, is entirely without meaning, if such is to be the construction. If congress remains at liberty to give this court appellate jurisdiction, where the constitution has declared their jurisdiction shall be original; and original jurisdiction where the constitution has declared it shall be appellate; the distribution of jurisdiction, made in the constitution, is form without substance.</p>
<p>Affirmative words are often, in their operation, negative of other objects than those affirmed; and in this case, a negative or exclusive sense must be given to them, or they have no operation at all.</p>
<p>It cannot be presumed that any clause in the constitution is intended to be without effect; and, therefore, such a construction is inadmissible, unless the words require it.</p>
<p>*If the solicitude of the convention, respecting our *175 peace with foreign powers, induced a provision that the supreme court should take original jurisdiction in cases which might be supposed to affect them; yet the clause would have proceeded no further than to provide for such cases, if no further restriction on the powers of congress had been intended. That they should have appellate jurisdiction in all other cases, with such exceptions as congress might make, is no restriction; unless the words be deemed exclusive of original jurisdiction.</p>
<p>When an instrument organizing fundamentally a judicial system, divides it into one supreme, and so many inferior courts as the legislature may ordain and establish; then enumerates its powers, and proceeds so far to distribute them, as to define the jurisdiction of the supreme court by declaring the cases in which <span class="star-pagination">*175</span> it shall take original jurisdiction, and that in others it shall take appellate jurisdiction; the plain import of the words seems to be, that in one class of cases its jurisdiction is original, and not appellate; in the other it is appellate, and not original. If any other construction would render the clause inoperative, that is an additional reason for rejecting such other construction, and for adhering to their obvious meaning.</p>
<p>To enable this court, then, to issue a mandamus, it must be shown to be an exercise of appellate jurisdiction, or to be necessary to enable them to exercise appellate jurisdiction.</p>
<p>It has been stated at the bar that the appellate jurisdiction may be exercised in a variety of forms, and that if it be the will of the legislature that a mandamus should be used for that purpose, that will must be obeyed. This is true, yet the jurisdiction must be appellate, not original.</p>
<p>It is the essential criterion of appellate jurisdiction, that it revises and corrects the proceedings in a cause already instituted, and does not create that cause. Although, therefore, a mandamus may be directed to courts, yet to issue such a writ to an officer for the delivery of a paper, is in effect the same as to sustain an original action for that paper, and, therefore, seems not *176 to belong to *appellate, but to original jurisdiction. Neither is it necessary in such a case as this, to enable the court to exercise its appellate jurisdiction.</p>
<p>The authority, therefore, given to the supreme court, by the act establishing the judicial courts of the United States, to issue writs of mandamus to public officers, appears not to be warranted by the constitution; and it becomes necessary to inquire whether a jurisdiction so conferred can be exercised.</p>
<p>The question, whether an act, repugnant to the constitution, can become the law of the land, is a question deeply interesting to the United States; but, happily, not of an intricacy proportioned to its interest. It seems only necessary to recognise certain principles, supposed to have been long and well established, to decide it.</p>
<p>That the people have an original right to establish, for their future government, such principles as, in their opinion, shall most conduce to their own happiness <span class="star-pagination">*176</span> is the basis on which the whole American fabric has been erected. The exercise of this original right is a very great exertion; nor can it, nor ought it, to be frequently repeated. The principles, therefore, so established, are deemed fundamental. And as the authority from which they proceed is supreme, and can seldom act, they are designed to be permanent.</p>
<p>This original and supreme will organizes the government, and assigns to different departments their respective powers. It may either stop here, or establish certain limits not to be transcended by those departments.</p>
<p>The government of the United States is of the latter description. The powers of the legislature are defined and limited; and that those limits may not be mistaken, or forgotten, the constitution is written. To what purpose are powers limited, and to what purpose is that limitation committed to writing, if these limits may, at any time, be passed by those intended to be restrained? The distinction between a government with limited and unlimited powers is abolished, if those limits do not confine the persons on whom they are imposed, and if acts prohibited *and acts allowed, *177 are of equal obligation. It is a proposition too plain to be contested, that the constitution controls any legislative act repugnant to it; or, that the legislature may alter the constitution by an ordinary act.</p>
<p>Between these alternative there is no middle ground. The constitution is either a superior paramount law, unchangeable by ordinary means, or it is on a level with ordinary legislative acts, and, like other acts, is alterable when the legislature shall please to alter it.</p>
<p>If the former part of the alternative be true, then a legislative act contrary to the constitution is not law: if the latter part be true, then written constitutions are absurd attempts, on the part of the people, to limit a power in its own nature illimitable.</p>
<p>Certainly all those who have framed written constitutions contemplate them as forming the fundamental and paramount law of the nation, and, consequently, the theory of every such government must be, that an act of the legislature, repugnant to the constitution, is void.</p>
<p>This theory is essentially attached to a written constitution, and, is consequently, to be considered, by this <span class="star-pagination">*177</span> court, as one of the fundamental principles of our society. It is not therefore to be lost sight of in the further consideration of this subject.</p>
<p>If an act of the legislature, repugnant to the constitution, is void, does it, notwithstanding its invalidity, bind the courts, and oblige them to give it effect? Or, in other words, though it be not law, does it constitute a rule as operative as if it was a law? This would be to overthrow in fact what was established in theory; and would seem, at first view, an absurdity too gross to be insisted on. It shall, however, receive a more attentive consideration.</p>
<p>It is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is. Those who apply the rule to particular cases, must of necessity expound and interpret that rule. If two laws conflict with each other, the courts must decide on the operation of each.</p>
<p>*178 *So if a law be in opposition to the constitution; if both the law and the constitution apply to a particular case, so that the court must either decide that case conformably to the law, disregarding the constitution; or conformably to the constitution, disregarding the law; the court must determine which of these conflicting rules governs the case. This is of the very essence of judicial duty.</p>
<p>If, then, the courts are to regard the constitution, and the constitution is superior to any ordinary act of the legislature, the constitution, and not such ordinary act, must govern the case to which they both apply.</p>
<p>Those, then, who controvert the principle that the constitution is to be considered, in court, as a paramount law, are reduced to the necessity of maintaining that courts must close their eyes on the constitution, and see only the law.</p>
<p>This doctrine would subvert the very foundation of all written constitutions. It would declare that an act which, according to the principles and theory of our government, is entirely void, is yet, in practice, completely obligatory. It would declare that if the legislature shall do what is expressly forbidden, such act, notwithstanding the express prohibition, is in reality effectual. It would be giving to the legislature a practical and real omnipotence, with the same breath which professes to restrict their powers within narrow limits. It is prescribing limits, <span class="star-pagination">*178</span> and declaring that those limits may be passed at pleasure.</p>
<p>That it thus reduces to nothing what we have deemed the greatest improvement on political institutions, a written constitution, would of itself be sufficient, in America, where written constitutions have been viewed with so much reverence, for rejecting the construction. But the peculiar expressions of the constitution of the United States furnish additional arguments in favour of its rejection.</p>
<p>The judicial power of the United States is extended to all cases arising under the constitution.</p>
<p>*Could it be the intention of those who gave this *179 power, to say that in using it the constitution should not be looked into? That a case arising under the constitution should be decided without examining the instrument under which it arises?</p>
<p>This is too extravagant to be maintained.</p>
<p>In some cases, then, the constitution must be looked into by the judges. And if they can open it at all, what part of it are they forbidden to read or to obey?</p>
<p>There are many other parts of the constitution which serve to illustrate this subject.</p>
<p>It is declared that "no tax or duty shall be laid on articles exported from any state." Suppose a duty on the export of cotton, of tobacco, or of flour; and a suit instituted to recover it. Ought judgment to be rendered in such a case? ought the judges to close their eyes on the constitution, and only see the law.</p>
<p>The constitution declares "that no bill of attainder or ex post facto law shall be passed."</p>
<p>If, however, such a bill should be passed, and a person should be prosecuted under it; must the court condemn to death those victims whom the constitution endeavours to preserve?</p>
<p>"No person," says the constitution, "shall be convicted of treason unless on the testimony of two witnesses to the same overt act, or on confession in open court."</p>
<p>Here the language of the constitution is addressed especially to the courts. It prescribes, directly for them, a rule of evidence not to be departed from. If the legislature should change that rule, and declare one witness, or a confession out of court, sufficient for conviction, <span class="star-pagination">*179</span> must the constitutional principle yield to the legislative act?</p>
<p>From these, and many other selections which might be made, it is apparent, that the framers of the constitution *180 *contemplated that instrument as a rule for the government of courts, as well as of the legislature.</p>
<p>Why otherwise does it direct the judges to take an oath to support it? This oath certainly applies in an especial manner, to their conduct in their official character. How immoral to impose it on them, if they were to be used as the instruments, and the knowing instruments, for violating what they swear to support!</p>
<p>The oath of office, too, imposed by the legislature, is completely demonstrative of the legislative opinion on this subject. It is in these words: "I do solemnly swear that I will administer justice without respect to persons, and do equal right to the poor and to the rich; and that I will faithfully and impartially discharge all the duties incumbent on me as, according to the best of my abilities and understanding, agreeably to the constitution and laws of the United States."</p>
<p>Why does a judge swear to discharge his duties agreeably to the constitution of the United States, if that constitution forms no rule for his government? if it is closed upon him, and cannot be inspected by him?</p>
<p>If such be the real state of things, this is worse than solemn mockery. To prescribe, or, to take this oath, becomes equally a crime.</p>
<p>It is also not entirely unworthy of observation, that in declaring what shall be the supreme law of the land, the constitution itself is first mentioned; and not the laws of the United States generally, but those only which shall be made in pursuance of the constitution, have that rank.</p>
<p>Thus, the particular phraseology of the constitution of the United States confirms and strengthens the principle, supposed to be essential to all written constitutions, that a law repugnant to the constitution is void; and that courts, as well as other departments, are bound by that instrument.</p>
<p>The rule must be discharged.</p>

<p class="indent">WRIT of error to the circuit court of the county of Alexandria, in the district of Columbia.</p>
<p class="indent">This was an action of debt upon a bill of exchange drawn by A. and W. Ramsay on certain merchants in London, upon which the plaintiff in error was indorser. The declaration claimed the amount of the bill with 'damages, interest, and charges of protest.' The verdict of the jury was for the debt, mentioned in the declaration. The suit was instituted upon the authority of an act of assembly of Virginia, which declares that any person 'may prosecute an action of debt for principal, damages, interest, and charges of protest against the drawers, &amp; c.' There was no averment of the amount of the charges of protest.</p>
<p class="indent">The exception taken in this court, and upon which only the court gave an opinion, was, that the debt demanded was not certain.</p>

<p>It is decided in Virginia that an action is maintainable by the assignee against the assignor, and not under the act of assembly.</p>
<p>*298 *February 26th. The Chief Justice delivered the opinion of the court.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*298</span> "The only question in this case is, whether an action of indebitatus assumpsit can be maintained by the assignee of a promissory note made in Virginia, against a remote assignor.</p>
<p>"The act of the Virginia assembly which makes notes assignable, gives the assignee an action of debt in his own name against the maker of the note, but is silent with respect to the claim of the assignee against the assignor. It was therefore long a doubt whether the assignor became liable on his mere assignment, without any special agreement, for the contents of the note, in the event of the insolvency of the maker. This doubt has at length been settled in Virginia, so far as to declare the liability of the assignor on such assignment; but not the amount for which he is liable. It seems to be yet a question whether he is answerable for the sum mentioned in the note, or for only so much as he received for it, provided he shall be able to prove the sum actually received. It is also a question whether the assignee can have recourse to any other than his immediate assignor.</p>
<p>"As the act of assembly gives no right to sue the assignor, such an action can only be maintained on the promise which the law implies from the assignment, and, consequently, can only be sustained by and against the persons to and from whom the law implies such a promise to have been made. As the assignment is made to a particular person, the law implies a promise to that person; but it raises no promise to any other. There is no fact on which to imply such promise.</p>
<p>"In the language of the books, there is a privity between the assignor and his immediate assignee; but no privity is perceived between the assignor and his remote assignee. The implied promise growing out of the endorsement, is not considered as having been made assignable by the act of assembly, and, therefore, the assignee of that promise cannot maintain an action of indebitatus assumpsit on it.</p>
<p>*"It is, therefore, the opinion of the court that this *299 action is not maintainable, and that the judgment ought to be reversed."<sup>[(a)]</sup></p>

ROBERT YOUNG AND CO.</h1></center>

<center></center>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*183</span> Swann and Mason, for the plaintiff in error.</p>
<p>C. Lee and E.J. Lee, for the defendants.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*189</span> Feb. 17th. The Chief Justice delivered the opinion of the court.</p>
<p>This was a suit brought by the defendants in error against the plaintiff, in the circuit court of the district of Columbia sitting in the county of Alexandria, and the declaration contains two counts for goods, wares and merchandises sold and delivered, and one for money had and received to their use. The cause came on to be <span class="star-pagination">*190</span> tried on the general issue, and a verdict was found for the plaintiffs below, on which the court rendered judgment.</p>
<p>At the trial of the cause it appeared that the suit was brought for a quantity of salt sold and delivered by Robert Young &amp; Co. to Clark; after which Clark endorsed to Robert Young &amp; Co. a promissory note made by Mark Edgar to John Pickersgill &amp; Co. which had been endorsed by them to the said Clark, and which was payable 60 days after date.</p>
<p>This note was protested for non-payment; after which a suit was brought thereon by Robert Young &amp; Co. in the county court of Fairfax against Clark; and the declaration contained two counts, one on the endorsement, and the other for money had and received to the use of the plaintiffs. In this suit verdict and judgment was given for the defendant Clark, the court of Fairfax being of opinion that a suit could not be maintained *191 against the endorsor *of the note, until a judgment had been first obtained against the drawer, and his insolvency made to appear.</p>
<p>After the determination of that action, this suit was instituted on the original contract; and, at the trial, the counsel for the defendant moved the court to instruct the jury, that if from the evidence given in the cause they should be of opinion that the promissory note aforesaid was endorsed by the defendant to the plaintiffs, in consequence of the goods, wares and merchandises sold as aforesaid, although the said endorsement was not intended as an absolute payment for the said goods, wares and merchandises, or received as such by the plaintiffs, but merely as a conditional payment thereof, yet the receipt of the said note, under such circumstances, and the institution of the aforesaid suit by the said plaintiffs against the said defendant, on his endorsement aforesaid, made the said note so far a payment to the said plaintiffs, for the said goods, wares and merchandises, as to preclude them from sustaining any action against the said defendant for the said goods, wares and merchandises, until they had taken such measures against the said Mark Edgar, as were required by the laws of Virginia; and that the plaintiffs, having instituted the suit aforesaid upon the said note against the said defendant, and that having been decided against the said plaintiffs, they were <span class="star-pagination">*191</span> barred from sustaining this action against the said defendant.</p>
<p>This instruction the court refused to give, but directed the jury, that if they were of opinion from the evidence, that the salt was sold and delivered as alleged, and that the promissory note aforesaid was endorsed by the defendant to the plaintiffs in consequence of the salt sold as aforesaid, although the said endorsement was not intended as an absolute payment for the said salt, or received as such by the plaintiffs, but merely as a conditional payment thereof, the same is a discharge to the defendant for the salt sold to him, unless it is proved that due diligence has been used to receive the money due on the note; but that the bringing suit on the said note against Mark Edgar was not essentially necessary to constitute the said diligence; and that the said diligence may be proved by other circumstances, and their omitting to bring the said suit against Edgar may be accounted for by the insolvency of Edgar, *if proved, *192 or any conduct of the defendant which may have prevented the bringing of the said suit.</p>
<p>To this opinion the counsel for the defendant excepted, and then prayed the court to direct the jury that the defendant was entitled to a credit for the amount of the said note, unless the plaintiffs could show that they had instituted a suit thereon against Edgar, or that Edgar had taken the oath of insolvency, or absconded at the time the note became payable, or unless the plaintiffs could show that they had offered to return and reassign the said note to the said defendant, previous to the institution of this suit.</p>
<p>This direction the court refused to give, and referred the jury to their opinion already given on the principal points now stated, and to which an exception had already been taken. This opinion was also excepted to. A verdict and judgment was then rendered for the plaintiff, without giving credit for Edgar's note, which judgment is now brought into this court by writ of error.</p>
<p>On these exceptions it has been argued that the court has erred, because,</p>
<p>1st. The conduct of the plaintiffs, Young &amp; Co. has disabled them from maintaining this action, and such ought to have been the direction to the jury.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*192</span> 2dly. The verdict and judgment in Fairfax court is a bar to this action.</p>
<p>The conduct of the plaintiffs was entirely before the jury, to be judged of by them from the evidence, excepting only that part of it respecting which the court gave an opinion. We are, therefore, only to inquire whether the opinion given by the court be erroneous.</p>
<p>It is agreed on both sides that the note in this case was not received as payment of the debt, and, consequently, did not extinguish the original contract. It was received as a conditional payment only, and the opinion of the court was, that in such a case the want of due diligence to receive the money due thereon would discharge the defendant. But the court proceeded to state *193 that due *diligence might be proved although no suit was instituted; and that circumstances, such as the known insolvency of Edgar, the drawer of the note, or any conduct of Clark, preventing a suit, would excuse Young &amp; Co. for not having instituted one.</p>
<p>This opinion of the court seems perfectly correct. The condition annexed to the receipt of the note cannot be presumed to have required that a suit should be brought against a known insolvent, or that it should be brought against the will of the endorsor; if he chose to dispense with it, or took means to prevent it, no hing can be more unreasonable than that he should be at liberty to avail himself of a circumstance occasioned by his own conduct.</p>
<p>It is not intended to say that the person receiving such a note is compellable, without special agreement, to sue upon it in any state of things. It is not designed to say that he may not, on its being protested, return it to the endorsor, and resort to his original cause of action; it is only designed to say that, under the circumstances of this case, nothing can be more clear than that there was no obligation to sue.</p>
<p>The court gave no opinion that the suit in Fairfax was, or was not, a bar to that brought in the county of Alexandria.</p>
<p>It is, however, clear, that no such bar was created.</p>
<p>To waive the question, whether in such a case as this with declarations for such distinct causes, a verdict in a prior suit may be given in evidence as a bar to another suit really for the same cause of action; it is perfectly <span class="star-pagination">*193</span> clear that in this case the same question was not tried in both causes.</p>
<p>In Fairfax the point decided was, that the suit against the endorsor would not lie until a suit had been brought against the drawer; in the suit in Alexandria the point to be decided was, whether the plaintiffs had lost their remedy on the original contract, by their conduct respecting the note. These were distinct points, and the merits of *the latter case were not involved in the decision*194 of the former.</p>
<p>On the second bill of exceptions, the only real new point made, is, whether the action is maintainable unless Robert Young &amp; Co. had offered to return and reassign the note before the institution of the suit.</p>
<p>Unquestionably Clark is entitled to the benefit of the note, but as it was no extinguishment of the original cause of action, there was no absolute necessity to prove an offer of the note before the institution of the suit. Indeed it does not appear, in this bill of exceptions, whether the note was merely a collateral security or a conditional payment. This is nowhere stated positively. In the first opinion of the court it is stated hypothetically, and that opinion must be considered on the presumption that such was the fact. But no such presumption is raised respecting the second bill.</p>
<p>Judgment affirmed with costs.</p>

<p>Simms, for the defendant in error.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*313</span> Chase, Justice.</p>
<p>There is here no exception applicable to this case. The bill of exceptions states only an abstract question. It is not whether the plaintiff in this case can maintain an action of trespass, but whether any plaintiff can maintain trespass for property loaned to a friend.</p>
<p>*314 *Swann, in reply,</p>
<p>Relied on the act of assembly of Virginia. The English cases do not apply; for in England they have no such statute authorizing the recording of deeds of personal property; nor any substitute for the actual delivery of possession of goods in any case whatever.</p>
<p>Even a mortgage of personal property is there deemed fraudulent as to creditors, unless possession accompanies the deed; and the reason given, in all the books, is, that it gives a false credit to the mortgagor, enables him to impose upon the world, and gives him a power to deceive and defraud those who deal with him. 1 Wils. 260. Ryall v. Rolle. But when such a deed is publicly made and exposed to view upon the public records, as this was, such reason must fail; and with the reason, the law must fail also.</p>
<p>As to the second bill of exceptions.</p>
<p>There is certainly a difference between a loan and a lease. In a loan the lender does not part with the right of possession, nor, in law, does he part with the actual possession; for the bailee's possession is the possession of the lender, who has a right to resume the thing into his own hands at any moment. There is no adverse possession, nor adverse claim, as there is in the case of a lease.</p>
<p>Fraud or no fraud, is a point to be decided by the jury, and not by the court. It is a question of fact; and the court have instructed the jury as if it were a matter of law. The possession of the vendor is not in itself a fraud, but only a circumstance from which, connected with others, the jury may presume the fact of a fraudulent intent.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*314</span> February 28th. The Chief Justice delivered the opinion of the court.</p>
<p>On the 4th January, 1800, Robert Hamilton made to Thomas Hamilton an absolute bill of sale for a slave in the bill mentioned, which, on the 14th of April, 1801, was acknowledged and recorded in the court of the county in which he resided. The slave continued in possession *of the vendor; and some short time after the *315 bill of sale was recorded, an execution on a judgment obtained against the vendor was levied on the slave, and on some other personal property also in possession of the vendor. In July, 1801, Thomas Hamilton, the vendee, brought trespass against the defendant Russel by whose execution, and by whose direction, the property had been seized; and at the trial, the counsel for the defendant moved the court to instruct the jury, that if the slave, George, remained in the possession of the vendor, by the consent and permission of the vendee; and if by such consent and permission the vendor continued to exercise acts of ownership over him, the vendee, under such circumstances, could not protect such slave from the execution of the defendant.</p>
<p>The court gave the instruction required, to which a bill of exceptions was taken.</p>
<p>The counsel for the plaintiff then moved the court to instruct the jury that a plaintiff in trespass, whose property is loaned to a friend, and is in that friend's possession at the time it is seized by a sheriff in virtue of an execution against the person so in possession, can sustain an action of trespass for a seizure upon such possession.</p>
<p>The court, being divided, refused to give the instruction required, and the jury found a verdict for the defendant. Judgment was accordingly rendered for the defendant, to which a writ of error has been sued out, and the question is, whether the court below has erred in the instructions given or refused.</p>
<p>In the opinion to which the first bill of exceptions was taken, it is contended, on two grounds, that the circuit court has erred.</p>
<p>1st. Because this sale is, under the act of the Virginia assembly against fraudulent sales, protected by being recorded.</p>
<p>2dly. That if it be not protected by that act, still it is only evidence of fraud, and not in itself a fraud.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*315</span> 316* *On examining the act of assembly alluded to, the court is of opinion that it does not comprehend absolute bills of sale among those where the title may be separated from the possession, and yet the conveyance be a valid one, if recorded within eight months. On this point one judge doubted, but he is of opinion that this bill of sale was not recorded within the time required by the act, and that the decision in the case of Eppes v. Randolph, which was made by the court of appeals of Virginia, on a different act of assembly, would not apply to this act.</p>
<p>On the second point there was more difficulty. The act of assembly, which governs the case, appears, as far as respects fraudulent conveyances, to be intended to be coextensive with the acts of the 13th and 27th of Eliz. and those acts are considered as only declaratory of the principles of the common law. The decisions of the English judges, therefore, apply to this case.</p>
<p>In some cases a sale of a chattel, unaccompanied by the delivery of possession, appears to have been considered as an evidence, or a badge, of fraud, to be submitted to the jury, under the direction of the court, and not as constituting in itself, in point of law, an actual fraud which rendered the transaction as to creditors entirely void. Modern decisions have taken this question up upon principle, and have determined that an unconditional sale, where the possession does not "accompany and follow the deed," is, with respect to creditors, on the sound construction of the statute of Elizabeth, a fraud, and should be so determined by the court. The distinction they have taken is between a deed purporting on the face of it to be absolute, so that the separation of the possession from the title is incompatible with the deed itself; and a deed made upon condition which does not entitle the vendor to the immediate possession. The case of Edwards v. Harbin, Ex'r of Tempest Mercer, 2 Term Rep. 587. turns on this distinction, and is a very strong case.</p>
<p>William Tempest Mercer, on the 27th of March, 1786, offered to the defendant Harbin, a bill of sale of sundry chattels as a security for a debt due by Mercer to Harbin. This Harbin refused to take, unless he <span class="star-pagination">*316</span> should be permitted, at the expiration of fourteen days, if the debt should *remain unpaid, to take possession *317 of the goods and sell them, in satisfaction of the debt; the surplus money to be returned to Mercer. To this Mercer agreed, and a bill of sale, purporting on the face of it to be absolute, was executed, and a corkscrew delivered in the name of the whole. Mercer died within the fourteen days, and immediately after their expiration Harbin took possession of the goods specified in the bill of sale, and sold them. A suit was then brought against him by Edwards, who was also a creditor of Mercer, charging Harbin as executor in his own wrong, and the question was, whether this bill of sale was fraudulent and void, as being on its face absolute, and being unaccompanied by the delivery of possession. It was determined to be fraudulent; and in that case it is said that all the judges of England had been consulted on a motion for a new trial in the case of Bamford v. Baron, and were unanimously of opinion that "unless possession accompanies and follows the deed, it is fraudulent and void;" that is, that unless the possession remain with the person shown by the deed to be entitled to it, such deed is void as to creditors within the statutes. This principle is said, by Judge Buller, to have been long settled, and never to have been seriously questioned. He states it to have been established by Lord Coke, in 2 Bulstrode, so far as to declare that an absolute conveyance or gift of a lease for years, unattended with possession, was fraudulent. "But if the deed or conveyance be conditional, there the vendor's continuing in possession does not avoid it, because, by the terms of the conveyance, the vendee is not to have the possession till he has performed the condition." "And that case," continues Judge Buller, "makes the distinction between deeds or bills of sale which are to take place immediately, and those which are to take place at some future time. For in the latter case, the possession continuing with the vendor till such future time, or till that condition be performed, is consistent with the deed, and such possession comes within the rule as accompanying and following the deed. That case has been universally followed by all the cases since." "This," continues the judge, "has been argued by the <span class="star-pagination">*317</span> defendant's counsel as being a case in which the want of possession is only evidence of fraud, and that it was not such a circumstance per se, as makes the transaction *318 fraudulent in point of *law; that is, the point which we have considered, and we are all of opinion, that if there is nothingbut the absolute conveyance, without the possession, that in point of law is fraudulent."</p>
<p>This court is of the same opinion. We think that the intent of the statute is best promoted by that construction; and that fraudulent conveyances, which are made to secure to a debtor a beneficial interest while his property is protected from creditors, will be most effectually prevented by declaring that an absolute bill of sale is itself a fraud, unless possession "accompanies, and follows the deed." This construction, too, comports with the words of the act. Such a deed must be considered as made with an intent "to delay, hinder, or defraud creditors."</p>
<p>On the second bill of exceptions the court did right in refusing to give the instruction required. The question propounded seems to have been an abstract question not belonging to the cause.</p>
<p>Judgment affirmed with costs.</p>

<p><span class="star-pagination">*323</span> Swann, for the plaintiffs in error.</p>
<p>E.J. Lee, contra.</p>
<p>Mason, in reply.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*329</span> The Chief Justice, after stating the case, delivered the opinion of the court.</p>
<p>To entitle themselves to the money for which this suit was instituted, it is incumbent on the plaintiffs to show that they have performed the very act, on the performance of which the money became payable; or that they are excused by the conduct of the defendant for its non-performance. The act itself has not been performed: but a tender and refusal is equal to a performance; <span class="star-pagination">*330</span> and it is contended that there has been such a tender and refusal in this case.</p>
<p>The pleadings show that the tender was not unconditional; but the plaintiffs insist that the condition, annexed to the tender, was such as they had a right to annex to it, and on their correctness in this opinion, depends the judgment now to be rendered.</p>
<p>The plea does not contest the sufficiency of the deed of assignment and power of attorney which were tendered; * 331 *and, consequently, no question concerning their sufficiency can arise in the present case.</p>
<p>The only cause relied on, as doing away the operation of the tender, is, that it was made on condition that a release of all the claims and demands of the said John Dunlop &amp; Co. on the said Hepburn and Dundas, should first be signed, sealed and delivered to them by Colin Auld.</p>
<p>The only question in the case is, whether Hepburn and Dundas had a right to insist on this previous condition; and it is admitted that this question depends entirely on the agreement of the 27th of September, 1799.</p>
<p>That an acquittance should be signed, sealed and delivered before the act itself was performed, which entitled the party to such acquittance, is a mode of proceeding very unusual, and which certainly could only be rendered indispensable by express stipulation.</p>
<p>There is in this case no such express stipulation. If the payment had been made in bills or money, the release of all the claims and demands of John Dunlop &amp; Co. against them was to have been given, not previous thereto, but upon receiving such payment. If, then, as has been argued, the deed of assignment and power of attorney are substituted for the payment in money, or in bills, and to be made on the same conditions on which payment in either of those articles was to have been made, yet there could exist no right to demand a delivery of the receipt before the payment.</p>
<p>If we inspect those covenants which relate to the deed of assignment of Graham's contract, we find no stipulation respecting a release of any sort. The agreement is, that he will receive the said deed of assignment at 21,112 dollars, towards the discharge of <span class="star-pagination">*331</span> the award, but he does not engage to give any release whatever.</p>
<p>It is contended that upon the general principles of justice and of law, Hepburn and Dundas had a right to the evidence of the payment they had made without expressly contracting for such evidence; and this is true, so far *as to entitle them to a receipt for the deed * 332 and power delivered; but neither the general principles of justice, nor of law, give Hepburn and Dundas a right to insist upon any release as a previous condition.</p>
<p>The case has been argued at bar as if the condition of the tender of the deed of assignment and power of attorney had been a release of all claims and demands to be given at one and the same time with the delivery of such deed and power, but this is not the case as presented in the pleadings. According to the plea, Hepburn and Dundas required the delivery of the release as a condition precedent to their delivery of the deed of assignment.</p>
<p>This demand seems not to have been countenanced by the contract; and of consequence the tender was not such as it was incumbent on Hepburn and Dundas to have made, in order to entitle themselves to the money for which they have brought this suit.</p>
<p>Judgment affirmed with costs.</p>

<p class="indent">[Statement of Case and Argument of Counsel from pages 240-249 intentionally omitted]</p>
<p class="indent">Mr. Chief Justice MARSHALL delivered the opinion of the court.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p1">
<span class="num">1</span>
<p class="indent">This is a writ of error to a judgment of the circuit court of the fourth circuit sitting at Baltimore, in the following case.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p2">
<span class="num">2</span>
<p class="indent">On the 30th of May 1800, William Robb, who was then a merchant carrying on trade and merchandise in the state of Maryland, signed, sealed and delivered to Gabriel Wood an instrument of writing, purporting to convey to the said Gabriel his real and personal estate in trust, to secure him from certain notes and acceptances made by him, on account of the said Robb; and afterwards, in trust for other creditors in the deed mentioned. This deed was acknowledged on the 14th of June; and was then enrolled according to the laws of Maryland.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p3">
<span class="num">3</span>
<p class="indent">On the 12th of July 1800, a commission of bankruptcy was sued out, founded on the execution of the deed above mentioned; and the said William Robb being declared a bankrupt, his effects were assigned to William Owings and Job Smith, who brought this suit against Gabriel Wood to recover the money received by him under the deed aforementioned.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p4">
<span class="num">4</span>
<p class="indent">Judgment was confessed by the defendant below, subject to the opinion of the court on a case stated, of which the foregoing were the material facts.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p5">
<span class="num">5</span>
<p class="indent">The court gave judgment in favour of the assignees, to which judgment a writ of error was sued out by the present plaintiff.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p6">
<span class="num">6</span>
<p class="indent">The only question made by the counsel was, whether the deed stated in the case was an act of bankruptcy.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p7">
<span class="num">7</span>
<p class="indent">On the 4th of April 1800, congress passed an act to establish an uniform system of bankruptcy throughout the United States, which declares among other things, that any merchant who shall, after the first day of June next succeeding the passage of the act, with intent unlawfully to delay or defraud his creditors, make or cause to be made any fraudulent conveyance of his lands or chattels, shall be deemed and adjudged a bankrupt.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p8">
<span class="num">8</span>
<p class="indent">It was admitted in the argument, that this deed, if executed after the first day of June would have been an act of bankruptcy, but that being sealed and delivered on the 30th of May, it was not within the act, which only comprehends conveyances made after the 1st of June.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p9">
<span class="num">9</span>
<p class="indent">For the defendants in error, it was contended, that, by the laws of Maryland, a deed is not complete until it is acknowledged, and therefore this conveyance was made on the 14th of June, when it was acknowledged; and not on the 30th of May, when it was sealed and delivered.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p10">
<span class="num">10</span>
<p class="indent">The Maryland act alluded to was passed in 1766, and declares 'that after the first day of May next, no estate of inheritance or freehold, or any declaration or limitation of use, or any estate for above seven years, shall pass or take effect, except the deed or conveyance, by which the same shall be intended to pass or take effect, shall be acknowledged in the provincial court, or before one of the justices thereof in the county court, or before two justices of the same county were the lands, tenements or hereditaments conveyed by such deed or conveyance do lie, and be also enrolled, &amp;c. within six months after the date of such deed or conveyance.'</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p11">
<span class="num">11</span>
<p class="indent">The fifth section gives the conveyance so acknowledged and enrolled, in relation to the date thereof.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p12">
<span class="num">12</span>
<p class="indent">It is well established doctrine of the common law, that a deed becomes complete, when sealed and delivered. It then becomes the act of the person who has executed it, and whatever its operation may be, it is his deed. The very act of livery which puts the paper into the possession of the party for whose benefit it is made, seems to require the construction that it has become a deed.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p13">
<span class="num">13</span>
<p class="indent">The question now made to the court is, whether the act of the legislature of Maryland has annexed other requisites to an instrument of writing conveying lands; without the performance of which, not only the passing of the estate intended to be conveyed is arrested, but the instrument itself is prevented from becoming the deed of the person who has executed it.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p14">
<span class="num">14</span>
<p class="indent">Upon the most mature consideration of the subject, the opinion of the court is that the words used in the act of Maryland, which have been recited, consider the instrument as a deed, although inoperative until acknowledged and enrolled.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p15">
<span class="num">15</span>
<p class="indent">The words do not apply to the instrument, but to the estate that instrument is intended to convey.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p16">
<span class="num">16</span>
<p class="indent">Since then the bankrupt law of the United States does not affect deeds made prior to the 1st of June 1800, and this deed was made on the 30th of May 1800, the court is of opinion, that the rights vested by the deed, (whatever they might be) are not divestd in favour of the assignees of the bankrupt, and therefore that they ought not to have recovered in this case.</p>

<p class="indent">ERROR from the fifth circuit in the Virginia district.</p>
<p class="indent">A judgment was obtained by the defendant in error, in the court of the United States for the middle circuit, in the Virginia district, in an action instituted in that court in January 1801, for a debt due by the plaintiff in error to him, for and on behalf of Laird and Robertson of Port Glasgow, Great Britain.</p>
<p class="indent">The middle circuit court in the Virginia district was established by the judiciary act of 1789, and continued until the 13th of February 1801, when an act was passed, entitled 'an act to provide for the more convenient organization of the courts of the United States.' 1 <i>Story's L. U. S.</i> 797.</p>
<p class="indent">By the twenty-first section of that act, all cases depending in the middle circuit court in Virginia, were transferred to other circuit courts, established by that law; and by the 'act to repeal certain acts respecting the organization of the courts of the United States, and for other purposes,' passed 8 March 1802, the provisions of the judiciary act of 1789 as to the middle circuit court of Virginia were revised, and re-enacted.</p>
<p class="indent">The case in the middle circuit court, went from that court in February 1801, to the court established by the act of 13 February 1801; and it afterwards, on the repeal of that law, returned to the court in which it was originally commenced. While it was pending in the court established in February 1801, certain proceedings were had, which were brought up with the record, and to which the exceptions were taken by the defendant below, and were presented for the consideration of this court.</p>
<p class="indent">The exceptions before this court were, 1. That congress could not transfer causes from one circuit court to another; and therefore all the proceedings in the court established by the act of February 13, 1801, were void. 2. That the justices of the supreme court of the United States could not by an act of congress be assigned to hold circuit courts.</p>
<p class="indent">[Argument of Counsel from pages 300-307 intentionally omitted]</p>
<p class="indent">Mr. Chief Justice Marshall having tried the cause in the court below, declined giving an opinion.</p>
<p class="indent">Mr. Justice PATERSON delivered the opinion of the court.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p1">
<span class="num">1</span>
<p class="indent">On an action instituted by John Laird against Hugh Stuart, a judgment was entered in a court for the fourth circuit in the eastern district of Virginia, in December term 1801. On this judgment, an execution was issued, returnable to April term 1802, in the same court. In the term of December 1802, John Laird obtained judgment at a court for the fifth circuit in the Virginia district, against Hugh Stuart and Charles L. Carter, upon their bond for the forthcoming and delivery of certain property therein mentioned, which had been levied upon by virtue of the above execution against the said Hugh Stuart.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p2">
<span class="num">2</span>
<p class="indent">Two reasons have been assigned by counsel for reversing the judgment on the forthcoming bond. 1. That as the bond was given for the delivery of property levied on by virtue of an execution issuing out of, and returnable to a court for the fourth circuit, no other court could legally proceed upon the said bond. This is true, if there be no statutable provision to direct and authorize such proceeding. Congress have constitutional authority to establish from time to time such inferior tribunals as they may think proper, and to transfer a cause from one such tribunal to another. In this last particular, there are no words in the constitution to prohibit or restrain the exercise of legislative power.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p3">
<span class="num">3</span>
<p class="indent">The present is a case of this kind. It is nothing more than the removal of the suit brought by Stuart against Laird from the court of the fourth circuit to the court of the fifth circuit, which is authorised to proceed upon and carry it into full effect. This is apparent from the ninth section of the act entitled 'an act to amend the judicial system of the United States,' passed the 29th of April 1802. The forthcoming bond is an appendage to the cause, or rather a component part of the proceedings.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p4">
<span class="num">4</span>
<p class="indent">2. Another reason for reversal is, that the judges of the supreme court have no right to sit as circuit judges, not being appointed as such, or in other words, that they ought to have distinct commissions for that purpose. To this objection, which is of recent date, it is sufficient to observe, that practice and acquiescence under it for a period of several years, commencing with the organization of the judicial system, afford an irresistible answer, and have indeed fixed the construction. It is a contemporary interpretation of the most forcible nature. This practical exposition is too strong and obstinate to be shaken or controlled. Of course, the question is at rest, and ought not now to be disturbed.</p>

<p class="indent">AN action of covenant was instituted in the circuit court of the county of Washington in the district of Columbia, against the defendant, late secretary at war, by the plaintiff, who was the owner and lessor of a house in the city of Washington, and which was by him leased to the defendant, Mr. Dexter, for the purposes of the war department. The buildings were destroyed by fire, and the plaintiff claimed to recover the value of them from the defendant, in this suit. The lease was in the following words:</p>
<p class="indent">'This indenture, made the 14th day of August, one thousand eight hundred, between Joseph Hodgson of the city of Washington and territory of Columbia, of the one part, and Samuel Dexter of the same place, secretary of war, of the other part, witnesseth, that the said Joseph Hodgson, for and in consideration of the sum of four hundred dollars, current money of the United States, to him in hand paid by the <i>said</i> Samuel Dexter, at or before the sealing and delivery of these presents, the receipt whereof is hereby acknowledged, hath demised, granted, and to farm let, and by these presents doth demise, grant, and to farm let, to the said Samuel Dexter and his successors, all that the three story messuage or tenement, erected and built on part of lot number 14 in square number 75, situate on the Pennsylvania avenue in the city of Washington aforesaid, together with the back ground and improvements; running from the said messuage (fronting 26 feet) in parallel lines down to lot number 12, on said square, being the premises next adjoining the messuage or tenement now in the occupation of Mr. Jonathan Jackson, with the improvements and appurtenances thereto belonging, or appertaining, to have and to hold the said demised premises unto him, the said Samuel Dexter and his successors, from the day of the date hereof, for and during, and unto the full end and term of eight calendar months from thence next ensuing and fully to be complete and ended. And the said Joseph Hodgson, for himself, his heirs, executors, administrators and assigns, doth hereby covenant, promise and agree to and with the <i>said</i> Samuel Dexter <i>and</i> his successors, that he, the said Samuel Dexter and his successors, shall and may peaceably and quietly have, hold, use, occupy, possess and enjoy the above demised premises for and during the term granted thereof, without the let, suit, trouble, molestation or eviction of him, the said Joseph Hodgson, or his heirs or assigns, or of any other person or persons whatsoever lawfully claiming or to claim by, from, under, or in trust for him or them. And the said Samuel Dexter, for himself and his successors, doth hereby covenant, promise and agree to and with the said Joseph Hodgson, his heirs and assigns, that he the said Samuel Dexter and his successors, shall and will at all times during the said term, keep, or cause to be kept, in good and sufficient repair, the said demised premises, inevitable casualties and ordinary decay excepted; and the same, so well and sufficiently kept in repair, shall and will, at the end of the said term, yield and surrender up to him the said Joseph Hodgson, his heirs and assigns. In witness whereof the said parties have hereunto interchangeably set their hands and seals, the day and year first above written.'</p>
<p class="indent">SAMUEL DEXTER, Seal.</p>
<p class="indent">JOSEPH HODGSON, Seal.</p>
<p class="indent">Signed, sealed and delivered in the presence of</p>
<p class="indent"><i>John Goulding</i>,</p>
<p class="indent"><i>S. Lewis, Jun.</i> The breaches stated in the declaration were two.</p>
<p class="indent">1. That the defendant did not during eight months keep the premises in repair, &amp;c. and hath not delivered up the same in good repair at the end of the time.</p>
<p class="indent">2. That the defendant did not keep the premises in repair, inevitable casualties excepted; but the same were destroyed by an evitable casualty, to wit, fire, which was occasioned and took place from negligence, or from the act or acts of one or more evil disposed persons.</p>
<p class="indent">To this declaration the defendant pleaded, That on the 8th of November 1800, the premises, against the will and without the negligence or other default of him the said Dexter, were burned and consumed by fire from some cause to him wholly unknown.</p>
<p class="indent">To this plea the plaintiff demurred, and the defendant joined in the same.</p>
<p class="indent">The defendant also pleaded, 'that on the 15th of May 1800, the president of the United States, for the time then being, in pursuance of authority given to him by law, did order and direct the various offices belonging to the several executive departments of the United States, of which the department of war then was and yet is one, to be removed to the city of Washington on the 1st day of June then next ensuing; and that in obedience to the same order and direction, the various offices of the department of war aforesaid were removed to the said city of Washington on the said 1st day of June, and that thereby it became proper and necessary, that a suitable building should be hired, in which the said offices of the said department of war might be holden and kept, and for this purpose, and for no other purpose whatever, the building, mentioned in the indenture aforesaid, was, by the said indenture, leased to the said Dexter; and that, at the time of executing the writing aforesaid, he was secretary of the department of war, and in that capacity did make and execute the same, and that before the expiration of the said term of eight calendar months, viz. on the first day of January 1801, he, the said Dexter, at Washington aforesaid, resigned the office of secretary of the department of war, and from and after that time, ceased to hold the same office, and until this time, he hath never holden the same; and further, that on the 5th day of March, in the year last mentioned, Henry Dearborn esquire, was there duly appointed and commissioned as secretary of the department of war, and then and there accepted of the same office, and hath ever since held the same; and he, the said Dearborn, now is, and ever since his acceptance of the said office of secretary of war as aforesaid, hath been the lawful successor of him the said Dexter, in the said office; and this, the said Dexter is ready to verify,' &amp;c.</p>
<p class="indent">The plaintiff replied, 'protesting that the said Dexter did not, in his capacity of secretary of war, sign, seal, execute and deliver, the indenture of lease aforesaid exhibited, yet, by way of replication, he saith, that although the said Dexter ceased to be secretary of war on the 1st day of January 1801, and that on the 5th day of March, in the same year, a certain Henry Dearborn became his successor, duly appointed secretary of the department of war, and still remains such, yet that the house and premises, in the lease aforesaid mentioned, were burnt down and consumed by fire arising from within the same, from the negligence or default, not of the said Dexter, but of some person unknown, during the term aforesaid, viz. on the 8th of November 1800, while the said Dexter was secretary of war, and whilst he had possession of the said premises, and before the appointment of the said Dearborn; and that neither the said Dexter, nor any other person, hath, during the continuance of the said lease, or at any time, built up and repaired the said premises; and this, the said Hodgson is ready to verify,' &amp;c.</p>
<p class="indent">To this replication, there was a general demurrer and joinder.</p>
<p class="indent">The defendant also pleaded, 'that on the 15th day of May 1800, the president of the United States, for the time then being, in pursuance of authority given to him by law,' ordered the executive offices to be removed to Washington, &amp;c. as stated in the defendant's plea, 'and that it became proper and necessary that a suitable building should be hired in which the several offices of the department of war aforesaid might be holden and kept, and that for these purposes, and for no other purpose whatever,' the buildings, &amp;c. 'were by the said indenture leased to the said Dexter by the said Hodgson, and that at the time when the said Dexter executed the indenture aforesaid, he was secretary of the said department of war; and this he is ready to verify,' &amp;c.</p>
<p class="indent">To this plea the defendant demurred generally; and the plaintiff joined in the same.</p>
<p class="indent">The circuit court gave judgment for the defendant, and the plaintiff prosecuted this writ of error.</p>

</div>
<div class="num" id="p2">
<span class="num">2</span>
<p class="indent">1. That under this contract the defendant was bound in his private capacity.</p>
</div>

</div>
<div class="num" id="p5">
<span class="num">5</span>
<p class="indent">It appears from the pleadings, that congress had passed a law authorizing and requiring the president to cause the public offices to be removed from Philadelphia to Washington; in pursuance of which law, instructions by the president were given, and the offices belonging to the department of war were removed; that it became necessary to provide a war office, and that for this purpose, and no other, the agreement was entered into by the defendant, who was then at the head of this department. During the lease the building was consumed by fire.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p6">
<span class="num">6</span>
<p class="indent">It is too clear to be controverted, that where a public agent acts in the line of his duty and by legal authority, his contracts made on account of the government are public and not personal.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p7">
<span class="num">7</span>
<p class="indent">They enure to the benefit of, and are obligatory on the government, not the officer.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p8">
<span class="num">8</span>
<p class="indent">A contrary doctrine would be productive of the most injurious consequences to the public as well as to individuals. The government is incapable of acting otherwise than by its agents, and no prudent man would consent to become a public agent if he should be made personally responsible for contracts on the public account. This subject was very fully discussed in the case of <i>Macbeathv. Haldimand,</i> cited from 1 <i>Term Reports;</i> and this court considers the principles laid down in that case as consonant to policy, justice and law.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p9">
<span class="num">9</span>
<p class="indent">The plaintiff has not controverted the general principle, but has insisted, that, in this case, the defendant has, by the terms of his contract, bound himself personally.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p10">
<span class="num">10</span>
<p class="indent">It is admitted that the house was taken on account of the public, in pursuance of the proper authority; and that the contract was made by the person at the head of the department, for the use of which it was taken; nor is there any allegation, nor is there any reason to believe, that the plaintiff preferred the private responsibility of the defendant to that of the government; or that he was unwilling to contract on the faith of government. Under these circumstances, the intent of the officer to bind himself personally must be very apparent indeed to induce such a construction of the contract.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p11">
<span class="num">11</span>
<p class="indent">The court can perceive no such intent. On the contrary, the contract exhibits every appearance of being made with a view entirely to the government.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p12">
<span class="num">12</span>
<p class="indent">The official character of the defendant is stated in the description of the parties. This, it has been said, might be occasioned by a willingness in the defendant to describe himself by the high and honourable office he then filled. This, unquestionably, is possible, but is not the fair construction to be placed on this part of the contract, because it is not usual for gentlemen, in their private concerns, to exhibit themselves in their official character.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p13">
<span class="num">13</span>
<p class="indent">The tenement is let to 'the said Samuel Dexter and his successors;' an expression plainly evidencing that it was not for himself, otherwise than as secretary of war; and that the lessor so understood the contract. It is also evincive of the correctness of the observation of the defendant, that the words 'said Samuel Dexter,' refer to him in his official character, as described in the premises. The habendum is 'to have and to hold the said demised premises to him the said Samuel Dexter and his successors,' &amp;c. showing, that to the knowledge of the lessor, if Mr. Dexter should go out of office the next day, the successor to the war department would succeed also to the occupancy of the office.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p14">
<span class="num">14</span>
<p class="indent">The covenant for quiet enjoyment during the term is with the said Samuel Dexter and his successors, and is, that they, as well as he, shall enjoy.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p15">
<span class="num">15</span>
<p class="indent">The covenant on the part of Mr. Dexter, on which the suit is brought, is for himself and his successors.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p16">
<span class="num">16</span>
<p class="indent">The whole face of the agreement then manifests very clearly a contract made entirely on public account, without a view, on the part of either the lessor or lessee, to the private advantage or responsibility of Mr. Dexter.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p17">
<span class="num">17</span>
<p class="indent">The only circumstance which could excite a doubt was produced by the technical operation of the seal. This, in plain reason and common sense, can make no difference in designating the person to be responsible for the contract; and so it has been determined in <i>Unwin v.

</div>
<div class="num" id="p18">
<span class="num">18</span>
<p class="indent">The court is unanimously and clearly of opinion that this contract was entered into entirely on behalf of government by a person properly authorized to make it, and that its obligation is on the government only.</p>

v.<br/>
MARSTELLER.<sup>[*]</sup></h1></center>
<center><p><b>Supreme Court of United States.</b></p></center>
<center>February 14, 1804.</center>
<p>The circuit court decreed, that the rents which accrued during the existence of paper money should be reduced according to the scale for the time when they became payable, but that the subsequent rents should be paid in specie. From this decree Faw appealed, and the case was now argued by <i>Swann</i> and <i>Mason</i> for the appellant; and by <i>E.J. Lee, Jones,</i> and <i>Key,</i> for the appellee.</p>
<p><i>For the appellant,</i> it was conterded.</p>
<p>The case, as stated by <i>Marshall, ch. j.</i> in delivering the opinion of the court, was as follows:</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*11</span> in the month of May, 1779, the executors of <i>John Alexander</i> in pursuance of a power contained in the will of their testator, set up to the highest bidder on a ground rent for ever, certain lots of land lying in the town of Alexandria.</p>
<p>One of these lots containing half an acre, was struck off to a certain <i>Peter Wise,</i> at the rent of Â£26 per annum, current money of <i>Virginia. Wise</i> bid for <i>Jacob Sly,</i> a citizen of <i>Maryland,</i> who transferred the lot to <i>Abraham Faw,</i> to whom the same was conveyed in fee-simple, by a deed bearing date the 5th of <i>August,</i> 1779, in which the said ground-rent of Â£26 per annum, <i>current money of Virginia,</i> was reserved.</p>
<p>In the year 1784, <i>Abraham Faw</i> divided the said half acre of ground into eight smaller lots, five of which he has sold, reserving a ground-rent for ever, amounting to Â£84 12<i>s</i> per annum. One of these lots was conveyed by <i>Faw,</i> to <i>Jacob Hess,</i> in the year 1784, at the ground-rent of Â£25 16<i>s</i> per annum, which lot has been since purchased by <i>Philip Marsteller,</i> the apellee, who has also purchased from the devisee of <i>John Alexander,</i> all his rights in, or issuing from the half-acre lot of ground conveyed to <i>Abraham Faw.</i> Thus <i>Abraham Faw</i> becomes liable to <i>Philip Marsteller,</i> for the rent accruing under the deed of <i>August,</i> 1799, who is himself liable to the said <i>Faw,</i> for the rent accruing on part of the same lot, under the deed executed by <i>Faw</i> to <i>Hess,</i> in <i>November</i> 1784.</p>
<p>In <i>November,</i> 1781, the legislature of <i>Virginia,</i> passed an act, calling paper money out of circulation: and also another act directing the mode for adjusting and settling contracts made in that currency.</p>
<p>The second section of this latter act, after stating, by way of preamble, that "the good people of the <i>State</i> "would labour under many inconveniences for want of "some rule, whereby to settle and adjust the payment "of debts and contracts entered into, or made between "the first day of <i>January,</i> 1777, and the first day of "<i>January,</i> 1782, unless some rule should be by law "established for liquidating and adjusting the same, so <span class="star-pagination">*12</span> "as to do justice as well to the debtor as the creditor;" enacts that from and after the passing of the act, "all "debt and contracts entered into or made in the current "money of this <i>State</i> or the <i>United States,</i> excepting, " at all times, contracts entered into for gold and silve "coin, tobacco, or any other specific property, "within the period aforesaid, now remaining due, and "unfulfilled, or which may become due at any future "day, or days, for the payment of any sum or sums of "money, shall be liquidated, settled, and adjusted agreeably "to a scale of depreciation herein after mentioned "and contained; that is to say, by reducing the "amount of all such debts and contracts to the true "value in specie, at the days or times the same were "incurred or entered into, and upon payment of said "value so found, in specie or other money, equivalent "thereto, the debtors or contractors shall be forever "discharged of and from the said debts or contracts, "any law, custom, or usage to the contrary, in any "wise notwithstanding."</p>
<p>The fourth section establishes the scale of depreciation which shall constitute the rule by which the value of the debts, contracts, and demands, in the act mentioned, shall be ascertained; and the fifth section enacts, "that "where a suit shall be brought for the recovery of a "debt, and it shall appear that the value thereof "hath been tendered and refused; or where it shall appear "that the non-payment thereof hath been owing to "the creditor; or where other circumstances arise "which, in the opinion of the court, before whom the "cause is brought to issue, would render a determination "agreeable to the above table unjust; in either case "it shall and may be lawful for the court to award such "judgment as to them shall appear just and equitable."</p>
<p>The act then empowers the court to direct at what depreciation any judgment shall be discharged on a verdict given for damages, between the first day of <i>January,</i> 1777, and the first day of <i>January,</i> 1782, having "regard to the original injury or contract on which the "damages are founded, and any other proper circumstances "that the nature of the case will admit."</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*13</span> It was proved in the cause, that the contracts made by the executors of <i>John Alexander</i> excited at the time very great attention, and were the subject of general conversation. The prevailing opinion among the bidders was, that the rents would be paid in paper money so long as paper should be the circulating medium, after which they would be paid in specie. Such too was the opinion of <i>Peter Wise,</i> the purchaser of the particular lot which occasioned the existing controversy, and there is reason to suppose it was also the opinion of those who were disposing of the property; it was also thought the rent reserved was low, when considered as payable in paper, but high if to be paid in specie.</p>
<p>It was further proved, that a lot not more valuable than that which occasioned the present contest, was sold in 1774, on a ground-rent of Â£13 5<i>s</i> per annum, forever, and that a lot less valuable was sold in the year 1784, on a ground-rent of Â£35 per annum. But it appeared from other parts of the testimony, that the lots which were sold in the year 1784, in <i>Alexandria,</i> on ground-rent, were contracted for so much above the value they afterwards bore, that the lessors in very many instances, were under the necessity of reducing the rents one half below the sum originally stipulated, and in some instances the reduction was still greater.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*22</span> <i>Marshall, Ch. J.</i> After stating the facts of the case, delivered the opinion of the court.</p>
<p>This suit was instituted to recover the rent in arrear, under the deed, executed in <i>August</i> 1779, a part of which rent had accrued during the circulation of paper money.</p>
<p>The circuit court decreed that the rents which became payable in the years 1780, and 1781, should be adjusted by the scale of depreciation, when they respectively became due, and that the rents accruing afterwards should be discharged in specie.</p>
<p>From this decree <i>Faw</i> appealed to this court, and it is alleged that the decree of the court below, is erroneous, because,</p>
<p>1st. The contract of <i>August</i> 1777, is within the 2d section of the act of the <i>Virginia</i> assembly, which has been cited. And if so,</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*23</span> 2dly. That it is not within the 5th section of that act.</p>
<p>The descriptive words of the act of assembly are "all "debts and contracts entered into, or made, in the current "money of this <i>state,</i> or of the <i>United States,</i>" "now remaining due and unfulfilled, or which may become "due, at any future day or days, for the payment "of any sum or sums of money." These words, it is urged, comprehend in express terms the very contract now before the court. That contract is an engagement entered into within the time specified by the act to pay several sums of current money in future. To make the case still stronger, contracts for gold and silver coin, tobacco, or any other specific property are expressly excepted out of the operation of the law. When those who introduced these exceptions, were so very cautious as expressly to take a contract for tobacco, or other specific property, out of the operations of a law made solely for money contracts, there are additional inducements to believe that every possible contract, not included within the exceptions, was designed to be comprehended in the general rule.</p>
<p>It is admitted in argument, by the council for the appellee, that the terms used in the first part of the section are such, that if they stood alone, they would include, in their letter, the case at bar: but it is contended, that there are subsequent words which limit those just quoted, so as to restrain their operation to contracts capable of being extinguished. These words are, that upon payment of what was the value of the debt or contract at the time it was entered into, "the debtors or "contractors shall be forever discharged of, and from "the said debts or contracts." These words, it is said, can only apply to temporary contracts, such as may be completely fulfilled, and from which the debtors or contractors may, in the language of the law, "be forever "discharged."</p>
<p>It will not be denied that there is much weight in this argument; but it does not appear to the court to be strictly correct. In searching for the literal construction of an act, it would seem to be generally true, that positive and explicit provisions, comprehending in terms <span class="star-pagination">*24</span> a whole class of cases, are not to be restrained, by applying to those cases an implication drawn from subsequent words, unless that implication be very clear, necessary, and irresistible. In the present case, the implication does not appear to the court to be of that description. A contract for the payment of distinct sums of money, at different periods, is very much in the nature of distinct contracts. An action of debt lies for each sum as it becomes due, and when that sum is paid, the debtor or contractor is forever discharged from the contract to pay it. To understand in this sense the words of the act which are considered as restrictive, does not appear to the court to be such a violence to their natural import as to be inadmissible; and to understand them in this sense reconciles the different parts of the clause with each other.</p>
<p>But although the counsel for the appellee may not have established the literal construction for which they insist, yet so much weight is admitted to be in the argument, that if they succeed in showing the case to be out of the mischief intended to be guarded against, or out of the spirit of the law, the letter would not be deemed so unequivocal as absolutely to exclude the construction they contend for.</p>
<p>It is urged, that the mischief designed to be guarded against, is confined to temporary contracts, and that by the spirit of the law, and the construction it has received, the time when the consideration, on which the debt is founded, moved from the creditor, is the real date of contract.</p>
<p>But the court perceives no sufficient ground for saying that this case is taken out of the mischief or spirit of the law by either of the circumstances which have been relied on.</p>
<p>The only real reason for supposing that the law might not be designed to comprehend interminable contracts is, that as paper money must unavoidably cease to circulate during the continuance of the contract, the parties must have measured their agreement by a more permanent standard.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*25</span> Very great respect, is certainly due to this argument, but it cannot be denied, that an agreement, which is to subsist for a very great length of time, as for a thousand years, would be entered into with precisely the same sentiments, as an agreement to subsist for ever. The contracting parties would be as confident in the one case, as in the other, that the agreement would subsist, after the paper currency would cease to circulate. Yet an agreement for a thousand years, would be within the very words and the spirit of the law, which plainly comprehends engagements for different sums of money, to become due in future at different periods. To suppose a distinction to have been contemplated between two such cases, is to suppose a course of reasoning too unsubstantial, and too finely drawn for the regulation of human action. It seems to be the date, and not the duration of the contract, which was regarded by the legislature. The act is applied directly to the date of contract, and the motive for making it, was, that contracts entered into during the circulation of paper money, ought in justice to be discharged, by a sum differing in intrinsic value, from the nominal sum mentioned in the contract, and that when the legislature removed the delusive standard, by which the value of the thing acquired had been measured, they ought to provide that justice should be done to the parties.</p>
<p>That the time when the consideration was received, constitutes the date of contract, according to the intention of the act seems not to be a correct opinion; nor, if correct, would it affect the present case.</p>
<p>If, for example, a contract had been entered into, in 1779, to be executed in 1789, whereby a specific sum in current money, was to be given for property then to be delivered, no doubt would be entertained, but that the case would come within the law, although the thing sold, would pass out of the vendor after the first of January 1782; yet the contract to pay the money, was entered into in 1779, and in the general legislative view of the subject, the value of the money at the date of the contract, is supposed to have regulated the price of the article.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*26</span> If in the case of rents, this argument of the counsel for the appellees was correct, it would follow, that rents accruing during the circulation of paper money, or leases made before the first of January, 1777, were within the operation of the act. If enjoyment is the consideration, for which the rent becomes payable, and the date of the consideration is in the spirit of the act the date of contract, then rents accruing between the first of January, 1777, and the first of January, 1782, or leases made prior to the former period, would be payable according to the scale of depreciation, and rents accruing after the first of January, 1782, or leases made for a short term of years, when depreciation was actually at the rate of 500 for one, would be payable in specie at their nominal sum. These consequences follow inevitably, from the construction contended for, and yet it is believed, that no person would admit an exposition, which he acknowledged to involve them.</p>
<p>The position then, that the value of the money at the time of the consideration, for which it was to be paid, was received, if the standard by which the contract is to be measured, is not a correct one, and if correct, it would not apply to this case, because, the real consideration is found in the contract itself, by which the right to enjoy the premises, is conveyed from the grantor to the grantee. This right was defeated by subsequent events, but does not originate in those events.</p>
<p>The case cited from 1st <i>Washington</i> 8, by no means conflicts with this opinion. In that case it was decided that where a written instrument discloses on its face any matter which proves that the contract itself was of a date anterior to the paper, by which it is evidenced, as when a bond carries interest from a past day, the contract shall be considered as of a date antecedent to its execution, and the scale of that antecedent date shall be applied to it. The reason of this decision is, that the price of the article sold, was measured in nominal moneyaccording to its value, at the date of the original contract, and not according to its value when the instrument of writing was executed.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*27</span> It is then the opinion of the court, that the contract of the 5th of <i>August,</i> 1779, comes within the second section of the act, "directing the mode of adjusting and settling the payment of certain debts and contracts, and for other purposes."</p>
<p>It remains to inquire, whether it is a case proper for the interposition of that equitable power which is conferred on the court by the fifth section of that act, and if so, in what manner, and to what extent that power ought to be interposed.</p>
<p>It is contended by the counsel for the appellant, that this case does not come within the fifth section of the act, because,</p>
<p>1st. That section is designed only for the benefit of debtors.</p>
<p>2d. No testimony out of a written contract can be admitted to explain it.</p>
<p>3d. If the testimony be admitted, it does not prove one of those extraordinary cases, which will be entitled to the benefits of that section.</p>
<p>1st. The fifth section is designed only for the benefit of debtors.</p>
<p>That the provisions of an act, for the regulation of contracts, should be designed uniformly to benefit one of the parties only, is at first view a proposition replete with so much injustice, that the person who would maintain it must certainly show, either that the words of the act will admit fairly of no other construction, or that legislative aid on one side only, was requisite in order to do right between the parties.</p>
<p>The counsel for the appellants endeavour to maintain both these propositions, and if they succeed in either, the case is clearly with them.</p>
<p>In reasoning from the words of the law, they say, that the two cases put, are by way of example, and as <span class="star-pagination">*28</span> they are both cases, where the scale established by the act is to be departed from, for the benefit of the debtor, the general power afterwards given to the court ought to be considered as designed to furnish a remedy in other similar cases not occurring at the time to the legislature.</p>
<p>The words of the section are, "that where a suit shall be brought for the recovery of the debt, and it shall appear, that the value thereof hath been tendered and refused; or where it shall appear that the non-payment thereof hath been owing to the creditor; or where other circumstances arise, which in the opinion of the court, before whom the cause is brought to issue, would render a determination agreeable to the above table unjust; in either case it shall and may be lawful for the court to award such judgment as to them shall appear just and equitable."</p>
<p>The terms used in the third member of the sentence are certainly very comprehensive, and their general natural import does not appear to be so restrained by their connection with other parts of the section, as necessarily to confine their operation to cases where debtors only can derive advantage from them.</p>
<p>The legislature was performing a very extraordinary act. It was interfering in the mass of contracts entered into between the first of <i>January,</i> 1777, and the first of <i>January</i> 1782, and ascertaining the value of those contracts, by a rule different from that which had been adopted by the parties themselves. Altho' the rule might in the general be a just one, yet that it would often produce excessive injury to one or other of the parties, must have been foreseen. It was therefore in some measure necessary to vest in the tribunals applying this rule a power to relax its rigor in such extraordinary cases. This sentiment might produce the fifth section, and if it did, the general terms used, ought to be applied to the relief of the injured party, whether he was the creditor or the debtor.</p>
<p>The opinion that the creditor could not in the contemplation of the legislature be the injured party, because <span class="star-pagination">*29</span> the scale of depreciation gave him the full value of his contract, does not seem to be perfectly correct. According to the law of the contract, all monies accruing under it, which were not received during the currency of paper, would be payable in such other money as might be current at the time of payment. It is impossible to say by any general rule what influence the knowledge of this principle might have on the parties, in every case where the contract was continuing and was to be fulfilled at future very distant periods. Unless the rule applying to such cases, possessed some degree of flexibility, it is apparent that the one or the other of the parties would often be injured, by the interference of the legislature with their contract, and this injury would most generally be sustained by the creditor, in all cases like that at bar, because in all such cases the conviction that a more valuable medium than that circulating at the time, would return during the continuance of the contract, must have had considerable influence on the parties in fixing the sum of money agreed to be paid.</p>
<p>There appears, therefore, nothing in the state of the parties to be affected by the fifth section of the act, which should prevent its application, either to creditors or debtors, as the real justice of the case may require.</p>
<p>But admitting the correctness of this opinion, it is contended that no circumstances can be given in evidence to explain a written contract, and therefore, it is said, that the judgment of the court in this case must be governed absolutely by the deed of <i>August,</i> 1779, unless other subsequent and independent events should control that deed.</p>
<p>The rule which forbids a deed to be contradicted, or explained by parol testimony, is a salutary one, and the court is not disposed to impair it. The application of that rule to this case, however, is not perceived. The testimony which brings this contract within the fifth section, neither contradicts nor explains the deed. It is not pretended that the deed was not executed on the consideration expressed on the face of it. But according <span class="star-pagination">*30</span> to the law which existed when the deed was executed, that consideration would be payable only in gold and silver coin, when gold and silver coin should become the only currency of the country. The law changing the nominal sum of money, by which the debt should be discharged, and giving a general rule, by which a different sum, from that agreed on by the parties, is to be paid and received, authorises a departure from the rule where circumstances shall arise which render a determination agreeable to it unjust. The examination of these circumstances is not entered into for the purpose of contradicting or explaining the deed, but for the purpose of determining which of two rules given by the statute altering the law of the contract does really govern the case.</p>
<p>The argument, that the exception, if it receives the construction which the court seems inclined to give it, would destroy the rule, must be founded on a supposition that in every case the circumstances would be looked into, and a slight injustice in the application of the scale of depreciation to the contract, would be deemed a sufficient motive for departing from it. But this is not the opinion of the court, and it may very readily be perceived that the great mass of contracts made during the circulation of paper money, may be decided by a general scale estimating the value of those contracts, although there may be very strong features in some few cases, which distinguish them as of such peculiar character, that they are embraced by the clause which measures their value by the standard of justice.</p>
<p>But although the just construction of the 5th section of the law, admits a creditor, who would be greatly injured by the application of the general rule to his case, to show circumstances which authorise a departure from that rule; it is contended that such circumstances have not been shown in the cause under consideration.</p>
<p>It is said that the case ought to be an extraordinary one, that the circumstances ought to be uncommon which would warrant a departure from the general principle established for the government of contracts generally.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*31</span> This is true, and the court would certainly not feel itself at liberty to exercise on a common occasion a discretionary power, limited only by the opinion entertained of the naked justice of the case.</p>
<p>But this appears to the court to be an extraordinary case. The evidence goes a great way in proving that the parties to the contract believed that the sums becoming due under it, would at no distant period be payable in specie only. This testimony is the more to be credited, because it is not easy to conceive any other motive for disposing of the property on the terms on which it was parted with; and still more, because such was the operation of the existing law on the contract when it was entered into. Under this impression, an impression warranted by the law of the land, a very valuable property has been conveyed away for what would have been, under the then existing law, a full consideration, but which a subsequent act of the legislature has reduced certainly to a tenth, perhaps to a twentieth of the real value of the estate disposed of.</p>
<p>Such a case is in the opinion of the court an extraordinary case, which is completely entitled to the extraordinary relief furnished by the act which has occasioned the mischief.</p>
<p>In inquiring to what extent this relief ought to be afforded, or, in the words of the law, what "judgment "will be just and equitable," the court can perceive no other guide, by which its opinion ought, in this case, to be regulated, but the real value of the property at the time it was sold. The record does not furnish satisfactory evidence of this value. It is proved that a lot not superior to that which occasioned the present contest, rented in the year 1774, for Â£13 5<i>s</i> per annum, and that other lots, perhaps not equal to it, rented in 1784, for Â£25 per annum. It is even proved that a small part of the very lots, about the value of which the inquiry is now to be made, rented in the year 1784, on a ground rent forever, for Â£25 16<i>s</i> per annum. These are very strong circumstances in support of the decree of the circuit court, fixing the rent at Â£26 per annum, <span class="star-pagination">*32</span> the nominal sum mentioned in the lease. But a majority of the judges are of opinion that the value must be ascertained by a less erring standard.</p>
<p>Neither the value in 1774 nor in 1784, ought to regulate the rent. The value at the date of the contract, must be the sum which in equity and justice the lessee ought to pay, and as this value is not ascertained by the testimony in the record, it ought to be found by a jury. In finding this value however, the jury ought not to be governed by the particular difficulty of obtaining gold and silver coin at the time, but their conduct ought to be regulated by the real value of the property, if a solid equivalent for specie had been made receivable in lieu thereof. On these principles the court has directed the following decree.</p>
<p>This cause, which was abated by the death of the appellee and was revived in the name of his administrator, came on to be heard on the transcript of the record, and was fully argued by counsel. On consideration whereof, the court is of opinion that there is error in the decree of the circuit court in this, that the rents reserved in the lease in the proceedings mentioned, bearing date the 5th day of <i>August,</i> in the year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and seventy-nine, and which were in arrear and unpaid, were decreed to be paid at their value according to the scale of depreciation when the same became due; and that those rents which accrued after the first of January 1782, are decreed to be paid according to the nominal sum mentioned in the lease; whereas, the annual rent reserved in the said lease, ought to be reduced to such a sum in specie, as the property conveyed, was, at the date of the contract, actually worth; to ascertain which, the evidence of the cause not being sufficient for that purpose, an issue ought to have been directed, according to the verdict on which, if satisfactory to the court, the final decree ought to have been rendered.</p>
<p>This court is therefore of opinion, that the decree rendered in this cause, in the circuit court for the county <span class="star-pagination">*33</span> of <i>Alexandria,</i> ought to be reversed, and it is hereby reversed and annulled; and the court proceeding to give such decree as the circuit court ought to have given, doth decree and order that an issue be directed between the parties, to be tried at the bar of the said circuit court, in order to ascertain what was the actual annual value in specie, or in other money equivalent thereto, of the half acre lot of ground which was conveyed, by the executors of <i>John Alexander,</i> deceased, to <i>Abraham Faw,</i> on the 5th day of <i>August</i> 1779, and that in the account between the parties, in order to a final decree, the representatives of said <i>Phillip Marsteller</i> be allowed a credit for the rent which has accrued and which remains unpaid, estimating the said annual rent at such sum as the verdict of a jury, to be approved of by the said circuit court, shall ascertain the half acre lot of ground before mentioned, to have been fairly worth at the date of the contract under which the same is claimed by the said <i>Abraham Faw.</i></p>
<h2>NOTES</h2>
<p>[*]  The counsel in this cause had not furnished the court with a statement of the points of the case, according to the rule of the court, <i>ante, Vol. I. p. XVI.</i> Being called upon by the court for such a statement, Swann observed that there was but a single point in the case, and therefore they had not supposed it necessary to reduce it to writing.
</p>
<p><i>Marshall Ch. J.</i> Â— The court will proceed to hear this cause without having been furnished with a statement of the points; but they wish it to be understood that they always expect such a statement. If there is only one point, it is the easier to state it.</p>

<center></center>
<p>The material facts of the case are stated in the argument of W. Tilghman.</p>
<p>W. Tilghman, for plaintiff in error.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*284</span> This case presents three subjects for consideration.</p>
<p>1. What was the situation of Daniel Coxe, with respect to his citizenship or alienage, from the commencement of the Revolution to the definitive treaty of peace between the United States and Great-Britain?</p>
<p>2. What was his situation from the time of the treaty to the death of Rebecca Coxe in 1802?</p>
<p>3. Supposing him to be an alien in 1802, is there any thing particular in his case to exempt him from the general incapacity of aliens to inherit land?</p>
<p>First. What was his situation between the commencement of the Revolution and the treaty of peace?</p>
<p>He was an officer of the king's government, a member of the council, and colonel of the militia, and without doubt under a positive oath of allegiance.</p>
<p>He never owed natural allegiance to the state of New-Jersey. When the Revolution was proposed, he had a right to chuse his side. 1 Dall. 53, Chapman's case, which was decided even in the very heat of the Revolution.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*285</span> He did chuse to adhere to the British. The record states that he removed to Philadelphia before or while it was in possession of the British, and has adhered to them ever since. He never took the oath of abjuration of the king of Great-Britain, or of allegiance to the United States, or any of them; nor has he by any overt act exhibited himself a citizen of the United States or of either of them. His remaining in New-Jersey until he found a safe opportunity of joining the British, ought not, on general principles, to have bound him to any thing more than that local allegiance to which even foreigners are subject.</p>
<p>But it may be objected that in as much as he remained in New-Jersey till the year 1777, and the act of 4th of October, 1776, (2 Wilson's Jersey laws, 4.) declares that all persons then abiding there, not only owe allegiance, but are members of the then government, it must be concluded that he was a citizen.</p>
<p>I shall not deny the right of the state of New-Jersey to take such precautions as they thought proper for the public safety; but at all events their object was no more than to deter persons from joining the enemy during the war, under fear of death, and loss of property.</p>
<p>They who joined the enemy were a class of people whom they did not wish to receive again, as citizens. They could have no objection to their being aliens after the war. All such persons (provided they were convicted of treason, or had forfeited their estates,) were forever excluded from offices of trust or profit, civil and military, and from voting at elections of representatives, &amp;c. by the act of 11th of December 1778, 2 Wilson's N.J. laws, 75, Â§ 23.</p>
<p>All these objects are answered by preventing Daniel Coxe from chusing his side after the 4th of October, 1776. Accordingly Daniel Coxe was proceeded against with a view to the confiscation of his property, but he was never attainted. The same proceedings might have been had against an inhabitant of New-Jersey who joined the British between the 19th of April, 1775 and 4th of October, 1776; or even against an inhabitant of another state who <span class="star-pagination">*286</span> owned property in New-Jersey. Act of 11th December 1778, 2 Wilson's N.J. laws, p. 67, Â§ 2. and p. 68, Â§ 3.</p>
<p>Granting, then, the most that can be asked, that Daniel Coxe could not divest himself of his allegiance during the war, we cannot infer that the same impediment existed after the war.</p>
<p>This brings us to the 2d consideration.</p>
<p>2. What was the situation of Daniel Coxe from the peace to the year 1802?</p>
<p>The act of 4th October 1776 only declares those persons to be subjects who were then abiding there. All danger being over by the treaty of 1783, a new Ã¦ra began, when every man had a right to leave the country and transfer his allegiance where he pleased. This is a most important right; and although Daniel Coxe now disclaims it, he would then have thought its denial cruel and unjust.</p>
<p>Of all people the Americans are the last who ought to call in question the right of expatriation. They have derived infinite advantage from its exercise by others who have left Europe and settled here. It is denied by the constitution of no state, nor of the United States.</p>
<p>It is positively affirmed by the constitutions of some of the states, viz. Pennsylvania, Kentucky and Vermont, and by an act of assembly of Virginia.</p>
<p>The right is also asserted by the best writers on the laws of nature and nations. Vattel, b. 1, c. 19, Â§ 218, 223, 224, 225, &amp;c. 1 Wyckefort, (L'Embassadeur et ses fonctions) 117, 119.</p>
<p>The same right is also asserted by our own authors, 1 Judge Wilson's works, 311 to 317. 2 Tucker's Bl. appendix, 426, (in a note) id. Vol. 1, part 2, appendix, 96.</p>
<p>It is also recognized by our courts of justice. 3 Dall. 153, Talbot v. Janson. And the case of the Charming <span class="star-pagination">*287</span> Betsy, in the circuit court of Pennsylvania, 26th May 1802.<sup>[*]</sup></p>
<p>It has also been recognized by our government who have received and accredited in public characters from England, many persons who resided in the United States, at the time of the revolution, viz. Sir John Temple of Massachusetts, Phineas Bond, esq. of Pennsylvania, T.W. Moore, esq. and Col. T.H. Barclay of New-York.</p>
<p>In the commissions of all these persons, they are said to be of London, or some other place in the English territories.</p>
<p>It has been also recognized by our legislature, who in their act of naturalization insist on persons coming from Europe renouncing their former sovereign.</p>
<p>It is recognized by England where other nations are concerned. They formerly allowed naturalization in their colonies after seven years residence. They allowed it to officers serving four years in the royal American regiments, and they now allow it to persons serving three years in their navy.</p>
<p>Supposing then that Daniel Coxe possessed this right of expatriation, does it appear by the record that he exercised it?</p>
<p>If he did not, it is impossible that any person ever can.</p>
<p>To prove that he did, his conduct during the war is very natural.</p>
<p>The offices he held at Philadelphia and New-York shew that he risked his life and fortune with the British. If he was not then a British subject it was because the act of New-Jersey of 4th October 1776 estopped him from that right. Nothing on his part was wanting. After the peace he removed with his family, and has remained in England, openly avowing himself a British subject ever since.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*288</span> But to be more particular.</p>
<p>1. He has carried on trade and commerce as a British, not an alien merchant. On this head the British are extremely jealous; none but bona fide British subjects enjoy this privilege. No American post-natus is allowed to hold a ship under the British navigation act; nor to trade to the British colonies, except under great restrictions; nor to be exempt from alien duties; nor to hold East-India stock.</p>
<p>2. He has been pensioned not only for his losses, but for his loyalty and attachment to the British government.</p>
<p>3. He did in 1795, or afterwards, apply as a British subject to the commissioners under the 6th article of the treaty of 19th November, 1794, and in his petition asserted that he then was, and from his birth ever had been a subject of the king of Great-Britain, under the allegiance of the said king.</p>
<p>This treaty agrees to make compensation on the part of the United States to British subjects who have lost their debts by legal impediments.</p>
<p>Daniel Coxe might have returned to New-Jersey after the peace and become a citizen by taking the oaths, &amp;c. The attainder in Pennsylvania was no hindrance, for the treaty of peace protected him from prosecution.</p>
<p>Thirdly. Let us now examine whether the alienage of Daniel Coxe is attended with any particular circumstances enabling him to take land by descent, contrary to the general principle of alienage.</p>
<p>On the execution of the definitive treaty of peace, the United States and Great-Britain were separate, independent governments. In that treaty ought to have been inserted any stipulation which the two nations wished to make touching the right of property to be held by individuals. And they have made some stipulations touching debts, and property both real and personal, but they were all confined to the security of property then held.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*289</span> With regard to lands there was to be no restitution; but Congress were to recommend restitution without condition. 1st. To real British subjects. 2d. To persons resident in districts held by the king, and who had not borne arms against the United States. As to all other persons, they were allowed to go to the United States and remain 12 months to endeavour to get back their property, and Congress were to recommend restitution, they paying the possessors the bona fide cost. There were to be no future confiscations, nor was any person to suffer any future loss or damage, in his person, liberty or property.</p>
<p>By the treaty of 1794, British subjects who then held lands in the United States, were, so far as regarded such lands, not to be considered as aliens; but they, their heirs and assigns, were permitted to hold, enjoy and dispose of the same, in like manner as if they were natives.</p>
<p>The general principle, that aliens cannot hold lands, has been adopted by New-Jersey; but by an act of assembly of 14th November, 1785, they have made an exception in favour of mortgagees.</p>
<p>But it is objected that the constitution of New-Jersey, having adopted the common law of England, has adopted also the doctrine of antenati.</p>
<p>The adoption of the common law was to secure the liberty and property of the citizens of New-Jersey, without regard to foreign nations, and not with a view of enabling British subjects to hold lands in that state. It was not meant to adopt those parts which were inconvenient, or inconsistent with our situation Â— such as that the king can do no wrong Â— personal and perpetual allegiance, &amp;c. Besides, the constitution of New-Jersey expressly excepts such parts as are inconsistent with the rights and privileges contained in that charter.</p>
<p>Now that charter is at variance with the principle of antenati, which is founded on the basis that natural allegiance cannot be shaken off; whereas the constitution of New-Jersey declares that protection and allegiance are reciprocal.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*290</span> This doctrine of antenati is founded on Calvin's case, which was determined 6 Jac. 1. when the ideas of the royal prerogative were extravagant and absurd. The authority of that case is much shaken by the many absurdities it contains. Some of its principles are ridiculous, some contrary to the present law of England, and some contrary to our own constitutions. As instances of the ridiculous, may be cited his 4th union, which is of the three lions of England and that of Scotland quartered in one escutcheon Â— that Moses was the first reporter Â— that all infidels are devils and perpetual enemies of christians One of the doctrines contrary to the present law of England is, that natural allegiance cannot be altered by the law or constitution of man, but is something celestial Â— de jure divino. Witness the English revolution of 1688. The same doctrine is also contrary to our constitutions. Witness our own revolution; Â— the preamble to the constitution of New-Jersey; Â— and the naturalization law which requires an oath of abjuration.</p>
<p>Woodeson, vol. 1, lect. 14, p. 382, says, "when the "king by treaty, ratified by act of parliament, cedes a "country to another state, the inhabitants, though born "under his protection, become effectually aliens, or liable "to the disabilities of alienage in respect to their future "concerns with this country; and similar to this I take "to be the condition of the revolted Americans, since the "recognition of their independent commonwealth."</p>
<p>An alien may take by purchase or devise, but not by de cent; and this is the case even with a denizen. Vaughan 278, Craw v. Ramsay.</p>
<p>What is the situation of the people of Louisiana? They have been transferred from England to Spain Â— from Spain to France Â— and from France to the United States. Â— To whom do they owe allegiance?</p>
<p>The incapacity of aliens to hold lands is founded in public good and convenience. By suffering them to hold lands, the revenues will be transferred to strangers; population is prevented Â— and the state is deprived of the personal services of the landholders.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*291</span> But it is said we should act upon principles of reciprocity. That the British allow us to hold lands in England upon the principles of curtesy. If their decisions have proceeded upon those principles, it is no reason why we should allow the British to hold lands here. It may be their policy to maintain the principle, but it is not ours. They had fifteen millions of inhabitants, we had only three. It was their interest to secure their claims on this country by mortgages and purchases of lands. But our courts cannot decide upon such principles. But if their decisions are founded in law, there was no use in the stipulation of the treaty respecting the right to hold lands. It is only by admitting that the inhabitants of the two countries were aliens to each other, that any effect can be given to the treaty.</p>
<p>The principle of natural allegiance does not apply as to this country. No antenatus ever owed natural allegiance to the United States. There can be but one natural allegiance, and that was due to the king of Great-Britain. American antenati therefore may hold lands in England, because they were born under the allegiance of the king of England; but English antenati cannot hold lands in America, because they were not born under the allegiance of the United States.</p>
<p>It is said in Tucker's Blackstone, vol. 2, appendix, note C. p 54, that after the declaration of independence, according to the principles of the laws of England, which we still retained, the natives of both countries, born before the separation, retained all the rights of birth, i.e. of inheriting lands, &amp;c. yet the preamble of the Virginia act concerning escheats, &amp;c. passed May 1779, 2 Tuck. Bl. append. p. 54, asserts that on the separation of the United States from the British empire, the inhabitants of the other parts of the empire became aliens and enemies to the said states, and as such incapable of holding the real or personal property which they had before acquired in the United States.</p>
<p>We say then upon the whole, 1st. That Daniel Coxe was always a subject of the king of Great-Britain, and never was a subject or citizen of the state of New-Jersey; and, 2dly, that if he was by force a subject of New-Jersey, he had a right, when that force ceased to <span class="star-pagination">*292</span> operate, to return to his natural allegiance, and shake off the compulsory allegiance which had been forced upon him by the state of New-Jersey, and which he always refused to acknowledge Â— and that he has done so. And lastly, that whether he was always an alien as to the state of New-Jersey, or whether he is to be considered as an expatriated citizen, he is still an alien, and therefore incapable of taking lands by descent.</p>
<p>Paterson, J. Suppose he expatriated himself since the peace, what is the consequence? Does he thereby become a complete alien, so as not to be capable of taking lands by descent afterwards?</p>
<p>W. Tilghman. So I contend.</p>
<p>Rawle, contra. The title of John Rodman Coxe is good, unless Daniel Coxe his father, was disabled to take by descent from his aunt Rebecca Coxe.</p>
<p>But he was incapable of taking unless,</p>
<p>1. He was an alien; or</p>
<p>2. Attainted of treason.</p>
<p>The latter is not found by the jury. He was, therefore, not attainted, nor incapable by reason of any crime.</p>
<p>That he was not an alien, I shall endeavour to demonstrate.</p>
<p>1. Every inhabitant of a state became, at the declaration of independence, a citizen of such state; so far at least as relates to the right of holding real estate.</p>
<p>2. He thereby owed allegiance to such state, and acquired capacity to take and hold lands in it.</p>
<p>3. Of this allegiance he could not divest himself. Of this capacity he cannot be deprived, except in the course of punishment for crimes.</p>
<p>If allegiance be considered as a contract, which requires the consent of both parties to make, it cannot be dissolved but by the consent of both.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*293</span> 1. The first position is laid down in a qualified manner, because, it is unnecessary to take a wider scope than the nature of the question requires. It is unnecessary to consider the entire doctrine of allegiance, and its incident, treason.</p>
<p>The fullest extent to which I shall press this first position, is, that prior to the declaration of independence we were all British subjects, and as such had the capacity to take and hold lands throughout the British empire. That the renunciation of allegiance, the change of government, did not divest of that right, even those individuals who in no shape recognized or adhered to the new government. 1. Because it was not implied from the nature of the revolution, and 2, because it was necessary to its safety or success.</p>
<p>In the formation of a new government or society, the acts of the majority (what Rutherford, Vol. 2, p. 18, calls the natural majority,) bind the whole.</p>
<p>The members comprising the major part, are citizens by choice Â— The minority by force. It did not authorise the majority, to seize the property of the minority. They were all members of the new state.</p>
<p>But by the opposite argument, the immediate effect of the revolution was, to commit the grossest injustice on the minority; to deprive them of their possessions because they differed in opinion: to render them aliens, and divest them of their lands.</p>
<p>Such intentions were not declared.</p>
<p>The independence of America was a national act. The avowed object was to throw off the power of a distant country; to destroy the political subjection; to elevate ourselves from a provincial, to an equal state in the great community of nations.</p>
<p>It was therefore a political revolution, involving in the change all the inhabitants of America; rendering them all members of the new society Â— citizens of the new states.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*294</span> The declaration of independence was not an unanimous act. It was the act of the majority. But the general sentiment of the day, was that it bound the minority. They were all equally considered as citizens of the United States. This principle was never questioned. The minority were never considered as aliens. Hence the penal laws of that time made by the states, consider some of that minority as traitors.</p>
<p>Such intentions were not implied.</p>
<p>The people of the colonies were absolved from allegiance to the British crown. The political connection between the people of America and the state of Great Britain was dissolved; and in the language of the declaration of independence, the right "to levy war, conclude peace, contract alliances, establish commerce, and do all other acts which independent states may of right do," was solemnly asserted, and publicly established.</p>
<p>To this distinguished act in the history of man, the assent of the people was essential. That assent was implied from the assent of the majority. The assent of the people, could only be known by the assent of the states. Not a state dissented.</p>
<p>New-Jersey was first. Her independent form of government, was adopted on the 2d of July 1776. But the division of the people who composed the states, and the disfranchisement of any part of them, were not necessary consequences of that assent. Every inhabitant continued a member of the society. Every inhabitant, therefore, continued to retain his property, whether real or personal.</p>
<p>But each individual state had to form its own government, and establish its own rules. We must, therefore, seek for those rules in the Constitution of New-Jersey.</p>
<p>The 1st, 2d, and 3d articles organize the legislature, (which by the 7th, is to choose the governor,) the 4th and 13th, expressly vest the power of choosing officers in the inhabitants, who have resided in the county for 12 months, and who have property to a certain value. Thus the inhabitants without distinction, are made members of the society, citizens of the state. Being citizens, all the <span class="star-pagination">*295</span> rights of acquiring and enjoying property, attached to them.</p>
<p>But Daniel Coxe was then an inhabitant. Will it be denied that he then was a member of the society? that he could then hold lands?</p>
<p>The legislature of New-Jersey, assembled on the 27th of August, 1776, and on the 4th of October, passed a law which must remove all doubt on this part of the subject. Every person "abiding" within the state, and deriving protection from its laws, is declared to owe allegiance to it, and to be a member of it.</p>
<p>But every man who abode within the state, received protection from its laws. It is found by the special verdict, that Daniel Coxe did at that time abide within the state; he therefore owed allegiance to it, and was a member of it.</p>
<p>The inquisitions found by the jury, were founded on two acts of assembly of New-Jersey. By those acts it will appear, that the objects of such proceedings were, and only could be, persons owing allegiance to the state. The act of 5th June 1777. (Wilson's Edition of New-Jersey Laws, appendix p. 5,) offers a pardon to "such "subjects" of the state, as had been seduced from their allegiance to it, and had joined the enemy; and enacts that if they did not return by the first of August, their personal estate should be forfeited, and that if perishable, or likely to fall into the hands of the enemy, it should be sold. The alienation of it by such persons, was declared to be void. But it did not forfeit the real estate.</p>
<p>This law speaks of their returning to their allegiance, not as alien enemies, but as offending subjects.</p>
<p>The first of the two oaths, required by that act, is in these words. "I A.B. do sincerely profess and swear, "that I do not hold myself bound to bear allegiance "to the King of Great Britain. So help me God." Â— The second oath is "I A.B. do sincerely profess and "swear, that I do and will bear true faith and allegiance <span class="star-pagination">*296</span> "to the government established in this state, under the "authority of the people. So help me God."</p>
<p>The effect of taking these oaths was a pardon, and restoration to the rights of a subject; not a naturalization as new subjects, but restoration "to all the rights of other the good subjects of this state."</p>
<p>The subsequent acts, prescribing the form of inquest, &amp;c. refer to this act, and are founded upon the delinquency or treason of the offenders.</p>
<p>Many of the objects of that law, having failed to avail themselves of its offered clemency, the act of 18th of April 1778, was passed. (Wilson's Laws of New-Jersey, p. 43.) This law was founded on the last, and expressly refers to it. By this act the real and personal estates of such persons, are to be taken into possession; the personal to be sold, and the real to be rented out.</p>
<p>The preamble is in these words:</p>
<p>"Whereas many of the offenders mentioned and described "in an act of free and general pardon, and for "other purposes therein mentioned, have neglected to avail "themselves of the benefit thereof. Therefore be it "enacted," &amp;c.</p>
<p>The next act of assembly is that of 11th December, 1778. By this act the estates of such "fugitives and offenders" as are in the other acts described, are forfeited.</p>
<p>The first section relates to such fugitives and offenders, i.e. to inhabitants owing allegiance, &amp;c.</p>
<p>The second section that every inhabitant of the state, who between the 19th of April, 1775, and the 4th of October, 1776, joined the enemy's army, or took refuge, or continued with them, or endeavoured to aid them by counsel or otherwise, and hath not since returned and become a subject in allegiance to the present government, by taking the oaths, &amp;c. of allegiance, is declared guilty of high treason.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*297</span> This, however, does not reach the case of Daniel Coxe, who did not join the British army until the year 1777.</p>
<p>By the third section every person, not an inhabitant of this state, but of some other of the United States, seized of real estate, who since the 19th of April, 1775, aided or assisted, &amp;c. as before stated, is declared guilty of high treason against the state of New-Jersey.</p>
<p>In both cases an inquisition finding the facts is declared to amount to a forfeiture of the offender's real and personal estate; and in both cases it is declared that such conviction shall not in any instance affect the person of any such offender.</p>
<p>It is therefore only and uniformly in respect to allegiance, to a breach of the duties of a citizen, to the state of New-Jersey or other of the United States, that the real estates are forfeited; and no authority can be collected from any of the laws, to proceed against real estate held by an alien; at least it is obvious that no such proceedings as are directed by these laws could be supported against an alien, merely as such.</p>
<p>2. That as a recognized inhabitant, as a member of the civil society, and a person owing (and permanently owing) allegiance to the state, he could hold lands within it, is a position too plain to be disputed.</p>
<p>The rule of the common law is that all persons may hold lands, except aliens. 1 Bl. Com. 371. Â— 2 Bl. Com. 249. But Daniel Coxe was not an alien. Daniel Coxe, therefore, may hold lands.</p>
<p>These two positions are supported by the collateral effect of the treaty of 1783. The 5th article recognizes the capacity of all persons, who have been the subject of judicial proceedings, to hold lands. Congress are to recommend to the legislatures of the several states, to pass laws authorising those persons who had adhered to the British cause to return to America, and there remain for 12 months, to obtain restitution of their estates.</p>
<p>In each case, therefore, the right to receive, and with it the right to retain and hold lands, are recognized; for <span class="star-pagination">*298</span> it would be absurd to suppose that he who is to receive it by virtue of the treaty, is immediately afterwards to have it wrested from him, as an alien.</p>
<p>On the subject of restitution, Congress were only to recommend, but on another, the treaty is peremptory. Â— By the 6th article there were to be no future confiscations. As a part of the former proceedings, or connected with them, the treaty removes that obstacle to the plaintiff's recovery; for the inquisition could only operate on what Daniel Coxe was then seized of or entitled to.</p>
<p>It is contended by the opposite counsel that the treaty authorises to hold only such lands as could be restored, not to hold new acquisitions.</p>
<p>But if our own laws could recognize a person as a citizen in part, and an alien in part, yet the 6th article gives them the right to hold new acquisitions as well as to retain what they held before. But the effect of the 9th article of the treaty of 1794, is still more extensive. It goes to exclude escheats pro defectu sanguinis. Neither they, nor their heirs, or assigns shall be considered as aliens. If Rebecca Coxe had been a British subject, the plaintiff below could have claimed under her by virtue of the treaty. Shall he not then inherit because she was a citizen of the United States? By the treaty of 1783, antenati could retain lands in both countries. That of 1794 provides also for postnati. Antenati may not only hold, but pass lands to postnati.</p>
<p>3. The third position embraces two divisions.</p>
<p>1. Allegiance.</p>
<p>2. Capacity to hold and transmit laws.</p>
<p>1. Daniel Coxe could not by his own act get rid of the allegiance he owed to New-Jersey.</p>
<p>2. He could not, except in the case of punishment for crimes, be deprived of his capacity to hold.</p>
<p>This point might be carried still further; and it may be contended that if he had expressly endeavoured to divest <span class="star-pagination">*299</span> himself of a capacity to take and hold lands, yet his heirs, being citizens of the United States, might claim under him. But this is not now necessary. It is sufficient to shew that as he denies any disclaimer of his capacity, so he cannot, by the interested views of his present opponents, be deprived of it; for the opposition is not now made by the state, but by private individuals who endeavour to blot him out of legal existence that they may double their portion of the inheritance.</p>
<p>It is a principle of the common law (which law is expressly adopted by the 22d section of the constitution of New-Jersey) that no man can put off his allegiance. Â— Hale, H.P.C. 68. 1 Bl. Com. 369. Forster's cr. law, 59. M'Donald's case.</p>
<p>It is true that Blackstone speaks of that allegiance which is coeval with birth; distinguishing it from local allegiance, arising from temporary residence.</p>
<p>But the allegiance due from Daniel Coxe was not of the latter kind; it did not arise and terminate with his residence in New-Jersey. It sprung from his inhabitancy in New-Jersey, when it created itself a state; from his being then, in common with all around him, a subject of the king; from the change which those around him, in the course of successful resistance, made in the form of their political society, by acts in which the majority must compel the acquiescence of the smaller number. That the minority were bound by the acts of the majority, was decided by Ch. J. Ellsworth in the circuit court in North-Carolina, in the case of Hamilton v. Eden.</p>
<p>Birth is but evidence of allegiance. At the time of a revolution residence is equally evidence of allegiance to the new government. Indeed it is stronger if the person be of mature age. It may at least be considered as a new birth.</p>
<p>It was natural allegiance; as society is natural to man, and allegiance is natural to society.</p>
<p>But without playing on the word, it may be characterized as permanent allegiance; the opposite of temporary.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*300</span> It is said that he never was to be considered as a citizen of New-Jersey, or if he was, that he expatriated himself.</p>
<p>1. That like Chapman, he made his election before any new government was formed, and on the dissolution of the old one; and therefore never was a subject of the state of New-Jersey. But the distinction between these two cases will be wide and glaring.</p>
<p>Chapman left Pennsylvania the 26th of December, 1776; Coxe not till September, 1777. Chapman was acquitted because he had left the state before the 11th of February, 1777, on which day the laws of the then late province were to be revived, according to an act passed on the 28th of January, 1777; and on which day the act passed declaring what should be treason, and that all persons now "inhabiting, &amp;c. within the limits of the state of Pennsylvania, "do owe allegiance," &amp;c. It was therefore declared that he was not a subject at the time of his quitting the state of Pennsylvania; and the attorney-general having averred that he was a subject and inhabitant of the commonwealth, it was held that the issue was not maintained on his part. If Chapman had resided in the state on the 11th of February, 1777, he would on the very principles of his own defence, have been been liable to indictment.</p>
<p>But Coxe was an inhabitant of the state of New-Jersey or the 4th of October, 1776, when a declaratory law, similar to that of Pennsylvania was passed. After which it was too late for him to attempt to change sides. He was then fixed as a subject, and liable to indictment for treason. Being thus, on the one hand, subject to the penalties resulting from his civil relation to the commonwealth, he is, on the other, entitled by natural and equal justice to the benefits of that relation.</p>
<p>[W. Tilghman admitted that by the law of New-Jersey, Daniel Coxe was to be considered as a subject of New-Jersey by force; and that the state had a right to make such a law. He had argued only upon the general ground, independent of the law of New-Jersey.]</p>
<p>Rawle. It is admitted then that he could not make his election until the peace of 1783. It was the first time he <span class="star-pagination">*301</span> ever heard that after an arduous conflict has successfully terminated by means of the energy and exertions of a majority of the people, each individual of the minority had a right of election which should look back and give a new aspect to his conduct through the period of the struggle.</p>
<p>[W. Tilghman stated that he did not contend for such an election, but that all the citizens of the United States, after the peace of 1783, had a right of expatriation, and Daniel Coxe among the rest.]</p>
<p>Rawle. Let us then consider this supposed expatriation, this imaginary dereliction of his country and his rights, this abjuration not only of allegiance, but capacity to inherit, which is to operate against him as a political estoppel; or like the ancient confession of villenage, is to deprive him at once of all power to take by descent or purchase.</p>
<p>It is perhaps a sufficient answer to say that expatriation is a fact which ought to be found.</p>
<p>Our opponents have piled together a confused and shapeless mass of evidence, on which this court cannot act. Â— Since even if expatriation had been allowed by the constitution or laws of New-Jersey, all the different facts put together would not amount to the technical fact of expatriation; and since if expatriation be not allowed, they are of no more importance than finding whether Mr. Coxe wore a blue coat or a brown one.</p>
<p>The circumstance most relied upon to prove Daniel Coxe's expatriation, is his carrying on commerce as a British subject. In this respect there has been a liberal construction of the rights of citizens of the United States in the British courts, even as to their navigation act. Â— They have, for the purposes of commerce, held that a person might be a British subject as to his duty of allegiance, and a citizen of the United States as to his commercial character. Thus in the case of Marryat v. Wilson, 1 Bos. and Pul. 430, 444, it was held that "both characters may stand together," and so in all cases so far as there are no conflicting duties, a man may be a subject of many different governments, and may enjoy the benefits conferred upon him by all. The right of Daniel Coxe to hold land <span class="star-pagination">*302</span> in New-Jersey does not conflict with any duty which he owes as a British subject. His becoming a subject of Great-Britain therefore, as to purposes of commerce, is not evidence that he had renounced his rights as a citizen or subject of New-Jersey. Nor does it follow, because he is a British subject that he is not also an American citizen. 1 Bl. Com. 369, 376. Â— 3 Dall. 169, Talbot v. Janson.</p>
<p>What then is expatriation? It is said to be an operation by which a citizen is made an alien. And it is contended that although Daniel Coxe was once a citizen of New-Jersey, it was against his will, and that the moment he had it in his power by the peace to throw off that character, he did it, and by becoming a subject of the king of Great-Britain, he became an alien to New-Jersey, and therefore not capable of taking lands by descent, in that state.</p>
<p>Many of the writers upon this subject have confounded expatriation with emigration; and hence has resulted great confusion. But the ideas are very different and distinct.</p>
<p>Expatriation is a matter of municipal regulation.</p>
<p>Emigration is of right. It cannot be restrained without injustice and even violence. Expatriation cannot be effected without public consent.</p>
<p>Expatriation dissolves the original obligation of the citizen.</p>
<p>Emigration only suspends its activity.</p>
<p>Expatriation incapacitates from taking lands in future.</p>
<p>Emigration retains that capacity.</p>
<p>Expatriation renders the future issue aliens. Emigration does not impair the right to be received as citizens.</p>
<p>Expatriation is an inconvenient and inflexible deprivation.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*303</span> Emigration destroys no rights, but facilitates the commerce and improvement of man.</p>
<p>Hence in no states, not depressed by the severest despotism, is emigration prevented. In very few is expatriation even known.</p>
<p>Of the 17 United States, one only (Virginia) has recognized or provided for it by law. In the constitutions of the other states, which have been cited, it is the right of emigration only which is protected, and not a word is said of expatriation. In the laws of Great-Britain there is no such term, or idea, as expatriation. It is altogether unknown.</p>
<p>As soon as a man has expatriated himself, his lands would escheat, and he would be divested of all the rights of a citizen. There has been yet no case in practice where the lands of an expatriated citizen have been escheated.</p>
<p>It is inconsistent with the nature of expatriation, that the party be permitted to retire from the community for purposes hostile to its welfare. No citizen can expatriate himself for the purpose of committing an act which would be treason, without such expatriation.</p>
<p>There ought also to be some municipal regulation defining the evidence and the mode, and declaring the assent of the government. 3 Dal. 133, Talbot v. Janson.</p>
<p>If Daniel Coxe had set up this defence on an indictment for treason, it would not have availed him.</p>
<p>If then his liabilities, on the one hand, and his rights on the other remained in full force at the time of his departure; if he took with him the capacity, as well as the responsibility of a citizen; are the subsequent events of his life to act retrospectively on his departure, and tear asunder the ties which bound him in 1777?</p>
<p>If such an effect can arise from these causes, the quo animo, the intention, ought to have been found, especially as it is a recognized principle that a man may owe allegiance to two countries at the same time, and therefore <span class="star-pagination">*304</span> may lawfully have the intention of owing allegiance to both Great-Britain and New-Jersey. The court cannot decide that it was with intent to expatriate. 7 Co. Calvin's case, 27, (a and b.). 2 Tucker's Blackstone, appendix, 53. Kirby's Reports of cases Sup. Court, Connecticut, p. 407. Apthorp v. Backus.</p>
<p>The counsel for the plaintiff in error have divided their case into three questions, according to three periods of time, in the solution of which they have employed much ingenuity.</p>
<p>1. From the beginning of the revolution to the peace of 1783.</p>
<p>This period seems to be nearly conceded; at least it is admitted that the state had a right to compel the inhabitants to become members of the new state or society. It seems to be admitted also that there is a sufficient finding of his residence in New-Jersey till 1777, to bring him within all the laws of that state. The test laws of 1778 could not have influenced his departure in 1777; nor did they give him any right to dissolve the connection; because the penalties imposed were the consequences of political offence; the punishment of treasonable flight. And to suppose that a man, by staying away to avoid the punishment of the law, had a right to dissolve the obligations of the citizen, is to lay down a principle tending to shelter every fugitive from justice.</p>
<p>It may be noticed that incapacity to hold lands is not among the penalties annexed to his disaffection. There are two legislative declarations: Â— 1. By making him a citizen and thereby giving him the capacity. 2. By imposing other penalties on the offence, but reserving this capacity.</p>
<p>It has been said that the object of the New-Jersey laws was merely fiscal. But the citizenship of Daniel Coxe does not depend on the inquisition, but on the act of 1776; i.e. he would have been a citizen by virtue of that law, although no inquest had been taken against him.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*305</span> It has also been said that the act of 1778 includes those who had offended against other states, and had never been inhabitants of New-Jersey, and therefore the legislature did not mean to compel them to become citizens. The answer to this objection is found in the case of Camp v. Lockwood, 1 Dall. 393, in which the offence was decided to be an offence not only against the particular state, but against all the states.</p>
<p>2. The 2d period is from the peace to the time of the descent cast in 1802. And it is contended that in 1783 Coxe had a right to make his election and choose his country.</p>
<p>But this position is attempted to be supported on a false basis. No such right is mentioned in the treaty. On the contrary the 5th and 6th articles manifest a mutual understanding that the loyalists were to return home, to obtain restitution of their estates, intimating plainly that if they could obtain restitution they would be entitled to hold.</p>
<p>3. The provision of the treaty, "that there shall be no future confiscations," settles the point of a capacity to take at present, and not in future. It was the universal understanding that a sale after the treaty, of property before confiscated, was no breach of the treaty. How then can there be a future confiscation but in consequence of a future taking? And he who can take in future is not an alien.</p>
<p>Daniel Coxe, who ought to know the quo animo of all the acts charged against him, declares by his counsel, that he never meant to give up his capacity to take and hold lands by descent or purchase: and his counsel declare that if such was his intention, he could not do it. These are two distinct propositions, both of which must be established by our opponents. They must prove not only the will but the power.</p>
<p>But it is said to be a hardship to deny the right of expatriation.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*306</span> The observations made upon this point apply only to emigration, and the right to emigrate is not denied.</p>
<p>But when a man turns his arms against his native country and ungratefully endeavours to destroy the hand which fostered and fed him, the arm of justice, though severe, is not misdirected.</p>
<p>And if in the decline of life he wishes to return to the bosom of his surviving friends, and be buried in the tomb of his ancestors, is he to be received only as an alien and an outcast Â— as a modern citizen of the world Â— a detached, rotatory, irresponsible and useless being?</p>
<p>Inconsistency runs through the whole of the argument for the plaintiff in error. The counsel contend for the rigid doctrine, peculiar to feudal tenures, that an alien cannot hold land, and yet discard the more rational concomitant feudal principle, which has been engrafted into the comr on law, that nemo potest exuere patriam.</p>
<p>The authorities which have been cited do not support the principles contended for by the plaintiff's counsel.</p>
<p>All the American constitutions which have been referred to, speak only of emigration. Virginia alone has provided by law for the case of expatriation; but that law cannot affect lands in New-Jersey.</p>
<p>Vattel speaks only of emigration.</p>
<p>Judge Wilson uses only the same expression, and gives his opinion of what the law ought to be, not what it is. It is said too that he decided a case in Virginia, of a claim under Lord Fairfax, upon principles contrary to those contended for by our opponents.<sup>[*]</sup> So in the case of Apthorp v. Backus, Kirby's Reports 407, the <span class="star-pagination">*307</span> plaintiff was a British subject before the revolution, and yet recovered the land in the year 1788.<sup>[Â†]</sup></p>
<p>Wyckefort, reasons upon general principles, on the subject of expatriation; but expressly recognizes the law to be otherwise in England.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*308</span> In the case of Talbot &amp; Janson, the court was of opinion, that the right could not be exercised without an act of the legislature.</p>
<p>The case of the Charming Betsy, in this court at the last term, did not decide the present question. For the question now is, whether, by becoming a subject of another sovereign, he is to all intents and purposes an alien.</p>
<p>Woodeson, probably means only postnati of America, if he had any clear idea at all upon the subject.</p>
<p>February 18. Stockton on the same side.</p>
<p>There is but a single objection to the title of the lessor of the plaintiff, which is that D.C. under whom he claims, was, before and at the time of the descent and conveyance, an alien, and therefore could neither receive nor transmit any estate in the premises in question. Â— This I shall deny: 1st. Because D.C. was born under the same ligeance with the other subjects of N. Jersey. 2dly. Because the legislature of N. Jersey, after the organization of their independent government in the exercise of constitutional powers, derived from the people, by statute declared him a subject of the new government; exacted from him the duty and submission of a subject, and punished him for a breach of his allegiance Â— but never deprived him of his capacity to inherit real estate. 3dly. Being thus once a subject of N. Jersey, by the constitution and law of that state it was not in his power to make himself an alien; and if it had been in his power he did not exercise the right.</p>
<p>1. Lit. sec. 198, defines an alien to be "one born out of the ligeance of the king," and he adds, "if he sues an action real, the tenant may say that that he was born in a country out of the king's ligeance." This is the universal form of pleading alienage. The defendant must shew that the plaintiff was born out of the king's ligeance and where. The definition of Littleton, taken from writers still older than himself, has been adopted by Vaughan, Hale, Foster, and Blackstone, indeed by all the English lawyers, and has never been questioned. The form of pleading is equally ancient, and both together, present a complete criterion of the law. That the place of <span class="star-pagination">*309</span> birth should determine the condition of the subject, is both reasonable and natural. It is reasonable, because he there receives the protection necessary to the preservation of life, during the helpless years of infancy Â— an obligation which can be conferred on him by no other country Â— because, there it is that he is immediately invested with all the privileges derived from society and government Â— giving him the force of the community to protect him in his rights of personal liberty, reputation and property, and at a time when he could make no return. How reasonable is it then that he should owe to such a country, the corresponding duty of allegiance? It is natural, because there exists in every good man, a virtuous principle of preference for that country, nay, for that spot, where he first drew his breath Â— where he passed his childhood Â— where his mind first opened to the endearing relationships of life, which nothing but the hand of death can extinguish Â— an amor patriÃ¦, which remains in spite of rejection, persecution and punishment, and which, even amidst the conflict of the passions produced by a sense of injury, still secretly leads him to his native country as his resting place. The common law, founded in reason and nature, therefore, proclaims that no m n born a subject can be an alien. But it is said, that D.C. was not at the time of his birth, a subject of the state of New-Jersey, and therefore may be an alien. Â— Answer. At the time of his birth, the king of England was the common sovereign of D.C. and the other citizens of New-Jersey; and by the principles and express rule of the common law, such persons never can be aliens, though a change of sovereigns should take place, and distinct governments be formed; for as on the one hand, the duty of natural allegiance accruing at birth, adheres to him through life Â— so on the other, the corresponding privileges, among which is the capacity to take and hold lands, must remain, unless forfeited by crime. The very point of Calvin's case, independently of the reasoning of Lord Coke proves this. There the antenati of Scotland were held aliens in England, though James was sovereign of both countries, because, at the time of their birth they were aliens. So on the other hand, the postnati were declared subjects, and it was held that they always must be considered subjects, because they were subjects at the time of <span class="star-pagination">*310</span> their birth. In 7 Coke, 27, b. Lord Coke puts the very case: "Wherefore, to conclude this point (and to exclude all that hath been or could be objected against it) if the obedience and ligeance of the subject to his sovereign, be due by the law of nature, if that law be parcel of the laws as well of England as of all other nations, and is immutable, and that postnati and we of England are united by birth-right, in obedience and ligeance (which is the true cause of natural subjection) by the law of nature; if followeth, that Calvin, the plaintiff, being born under one ligeance to one king, cannot be an alien born."</p>
<p>This is not then to be considered as one of the extrajudicial and fanciful reasons of Lord Coke, of which so much has been said, but a consequence not only clearly flowing from undoubted principles, but adopted by ancient practice, and proved by the history and law of England. Such was the condition of those provinces of France, claimed and held by the kings of England. These were subject to continual revolutions and change of sovereigns, as the arms of either king prevailed; but Frenchmen, born while the kings of England were in possession, were held not to be aliens when that possession ceased, and might hold lands in England. 7 Coke 20. b, is express to this purpose, and in 2 Viner. 261, pl. 11, it will be seen, that this doctrine was considered as law by other judges. It has indeed been said, that Calvin's case is not law, and his reasoning has been stated to be servile and ridiculous. That it partakes largely of the quaint pedantry of the times, is not to be denied; but that my Lord Coke would lay down, and take such pains to prove a false position of common law, comports not with his character, either as a lawyer or a man; and the case of the commendams is of itself enough, to rescue his character from the imputation of undue servility. Besides, the determination in Calvin's case, has never been overruled or questioned; it is supported by the names of the venerable Fleta, Bracton, &amp; Britton. It received the sanction of Lord Chief Justice Vaughan, (Vaughan's Rep. 285,) of Lord Hale, as may be seen in his history of the pleas of the Crown; and in 4 Term Rep. 308, the same doctrine is laid down as the modern law of Westminster-Hall, <span class="star-pagination">*311</span> by Lord Kenyon. This doctrine that the antenati should be capable of inheriting is founded in justice; a right once vested, ought never to be divested, unless it be for a crime. An empire is rent asunder by a revolution; the individuals of each territory may be innocent; if guilty, they can only suffer the punishment, annexed by law to the crime; it was impossible for Daniel Coxe to commit a crime against New-Jersy, which could destroy his inheritable blood, that being saved even on conviction of treason.</p>
<p>The opinion of the most celebrated jurist of our country, is, expressly in favour of my position. Judge Tucker, in his notes on Blackstone, not only considers the rule in Calvin's case to be law, but applies it to the antenati Americans, who he says may hold lands in both countries. 2 Tucker's Black. Appen. 53, Note c. But it is again said by our learned adversary, that this doctrine of the common law, is derogatory to the feelings and character of freemen, and altogether inconsistent with our present forms of government, and political institutions; it is, however, conceived that this doctrine contains in it no principle of the nature ascribed to it, and that its results are especially applicable to our political system. What is the injunction of the common law? not that a man shall, like the trees of our forests, be planted and affixed to the place where he was born; not that he shall be prohibited from bettering his condition elsewhere; it restrains not the right of emigration under proper restraints and limitations: on the contrary, the subjects of this law, enjoy more liberty in this respect than all the rest of Europe. It only says to them, if you do emigrate, you shall still retain the privileges and be under the restraints of your natural allegiance. Â— What can be discovered in this derogatory to a freeman? No; it should rather be considered as an invaluable privilege; the price of a reasonable and prudent restraint. In it is only heard the voice of exalted Patriotism saying to her children, go gain your support, seek your happiness in fairer fields, in a more genial clime; but remember (and it is the only restraint I place you under) raise not a parricidal hand against your native land. The results of this doctrine appear to me peculiarly applicable to our political position. We are not a confederated republic. <span class="star-pagination">*312</span> Â— Our general government is composed of a number of distinct and independent states, uniting under one head by mutual consent for common benefit. But an event may happen (which every good man should join with my Lord Coke in his devout prayer, "that God of his infinite goodness and mercy may prevent,") Â— time may come when this bond of union may be broken, this confederacy dissolved, and these sovereignties become altogether and completely independent. In this event what security would a citizen of one state have for his lands held in another, but this much reprobated maxim of the common law? With it all would be safe Â— we were once fellow-citizens Â— we owed allegiance to a common head Â— we never can be aliens. Without it our lands held out of the state in which we live, would be liable to escheat on the ground of alienage.</p>
<p>Let us not, affect to be wiser than the law. Let us not, for idle theories, absurd as well as impracticable, depart from those principles which have secured to our ancestors the complete enjoyment of their liberty and property.</p>
<p>2. But supposing that this doctrine of the common law that the place of birth does conclusively fix the character of a subject, should be considered as not applicable to the case of a revolution by which one part of a nation is severed from the other, becomes independent, and forms a separate government. We must then search ex necessitate for some other principle, as a substitute for the common law principle, and which shall denote who are and who are not members of the new community. Now, the natural, the only practicable substitute is this, that those residing at the time of the revolution in the territory separating itself from the parent country, are subject to the new government, and become members of the new community, on the ground either of tacit consent, evidenced by their abiding in such territory; or on the principle that every individual is bound by the act of the majority. Hence, as birth at the common law denotes the subject, so residence at the time of the revolution will draw with it the same consequence. The great men who conducted the revolution in New-Jersey were at no loss to discover this principle. Â— They recognized it by their constitution and first acts of legislative power. By law they claimed all men in the situation of D.C. to be their subjects. This brings me <span class="star-pagination">*313</span> to the second point which was, that D.C. could be no alien because the legislature of New-Jersey proclaimed him a subject, claimed his allegiance as one, and punished him as one for a breach of it, without, however, taking from him his inheritable rights. The new constitution was adopted in New-Jersey, July 2d, 1776. October 4th, Wilson N.J.L. 4. The legislature then first convened under it passed their treason act, in which it is declared "that all persons abiding within the state, and deriving protection from the laws thereof, do owe allegiance to the government of this state, established under the authority of the people, and are to be deemed members thereof." Then they go on and declare all such guilty of treason who shall adhere to the king of G. Britain Â— saving the corruption of blood. D.C. as the jury have found, was born in New-Jersey, was living and abiding in the state at that time, and adhered to the British by joining their army more than one year afterwards.</p>
<p>This description of who were subjects of the state of New-Jersey, was always closely pursued by the legislature and ended in the seizing and forfeiting the estates of all those who had withdrawn within the British lines, and so could not be attainted on trial, according to the course of the common law.</p>
<p>Wilson, N.J.L. Appen. 5, contains the next act Â— it is an act of free and general pardon. The former act had declared who were subjects, who could offend Â— this offers conditional pardon on their return to their allegiance, and forfeits the personal estate of those who did not accept proffered grace. Then follow the several acts of Dec. 8th, 1778, Appendix 8; of April 18th, 1778, Wilson, N.J.L. 43; of 11th Dec. 1778, in which the same description of subjects given in the first act is confirmed Â— provisions made to punish them if they persist in their rebellion to the state, which ends, and in this case did end, in the entire confiscation of the real and personal estate of the offending subject. It was observed on these acts, that they appeared to be rather of a fiscal nature than any other, and were not so much designed to prescribe duties, and punish transgressions, as to bring money into the treasury. Such an object would have been unjust and pitiful, and was never contemplated at the time they were enacted. No; the patriots of that day had a more sublime object. <span class="star-pagination">*314</span> Their great object was independence. By these acts they meant to legitimate the revolution by the supreme power of the people. They proclaim their new and republican government. They declare whom they consider as the members composing this new community. They proceed to impose the duties arising out of their new condition, and to enforce the performance of these duties by the sanction of adequate punishment for their violation. They did not, it is true, pass attainder acts affecting the person of the offender, because such acts were deemed inconsistent with their avowed principles. Such acts go to take the life of a man without trial by jury Â— to convict him of personal offences in his absence, against a maxim of the law. These obstacles did not exist in so strong a degree in proceedings in rem, which ended in punishment by loss of property. Fiscal considerations then had nothing more to do with this subject than they have with all other cases of crimes punished by forfeiture or pecuniary mulct. Â— They are but consequences of the crime, not objects of the law. The 2d. section of the last act which punishes treasonable acts between the 19th of April, 1775, when the civil war first broke out, and the 4th of Oct. 1776, when the treason act passed, it was said, was particularly subject to this objection; for it was urged, as this related to a period prior to the establishment of the new government, and before there was a treason act, there could be no other ground for the provision. I conceive the learned gentleman equally mistaken in this suggestion. It is well known in New-Jersey that government did not cease between these days. The people governed themselves in their primitive capacity by committees of safety in each county, and by a provincial congress. This congress did, in fact, pass an ordinance of treason soon after the war commenced, containing the same provisions with the treason act of 4th Oct. 1776. This section then referred to this notorious fact, and was designed to give the sanction of the legislature to the provisions of that ordinance. Â— And both this ordinance and this section of the act, contained in them nothing more than the principle acted on throughout the war, that Americans could at no period legally act against this country, but were bound to take its part from the first hour the sword was drawn. What then is the fair result of all these provisions? We see an old government dissolved and a new one created. The people at first, and their representatives afterwards, declare <span class="star-pagination">*315</span> by law all men abiding within their territory, subjects of the new government. They pass treason acts, define allegiance, and enforce its duties by the accustomed sanctions of the law. These laws operated on D.C. He was an abider within their territory. They claim him as a subject, and punish him for refusing to yield obedience. Shall, then, this same government, which with a voice of thunder proclaimed him a subject and punished him as one, or shall an individual under its laws now say to him, you are an alien? Shall he be declared a subject to punish him and an alien to punish him? A subject to take all he has, and an alien to prevent his acquiring any in future? Shall he be made poor by citizenship, and be kept poor for want of it? No, I apprehend not. The government, and all claiming through its laws, are estopped to say he is an alien, and no act of his, as I shall directly shew, would alter his condition. The legislature never meant to adopt such inconsistent and repugnant principles. They carried through their work correctly on their own plan. It is by pursuing now an opposite one on a scheme of private interest that the incongruity is produced. They had a right to declare the colonists members of the new government on the clear republican principle that the minority must yield to the majority. But they had no intention of going further by illegally taking from them their birth-right Â— their capacity to inherit lands. These laws also destroy at once the fanciful doctrine of election in case of civil wars. It may, for aught I know, be just enough to give men a free election in such cases to adhere to the old, or to join the new government. But then was the time to have acted on this magnanimous principle. The legislature abjured it; they declared by their treason act that no Jerseyman had an election to join against his country.</p>
<p>The learned counsel seemed to yield to the force of this conclusion so far as respected the period from the commencement of the war to the treaty of peace; but at the Ã¦ra of the peace he says, Mr. C. had a right to continue a British subject, which he did, and so has become an alien. But we have shewn him to have once been a subject of the state of New-Jersey by their own concession; that is to say, from the commencement of the war to the treaty of 1783. This, then, opens to me the last point I propose to treat.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*316</span> 3dly. D.C. having once been a subject of New-Jersey, it was not in his power, without the concurrence of New-Jersey, expressed by legislative act, to become an alien. And if he possessed the power he never exercised it.</p>
<p>The modern theory of expatriation has been relied on Â— nay, our adversaries seem to place their cause on it Â— a narrow point indeed whereon, in a common law court, to defend an ejectment! and what becomes of it when we reflect that the common law expressly prohibits this supposed right of expatriation Â— that the constitution of New-Jersey expressly adopts this common law, and that the legislature have, by particular act, enacted and incorporated into their system the common law doctrine of allegiance?</p>
<p>1. By the common law, expatriation is not barely not permitted, but it is distinctly prohibited. The maxim of that law is nemo potest exuere patriam. By the common law, allegiance is perpetual. Bracton, Coke, Hale, Foster, and Blackstone consider this as a fundamental principle of that law. Mr. Swift, 1 vol. L.C. 164, very properly observes, that this is the law of such of the United States as have adopted the common law without altering this principle.</p>
<p>2. The 22d section of the constitution of New-Jersey adopts the common law of England generally, except such parts as are inconsistent with the rights and privileges of that charter. The gentlemen have relied on this exception; and the only question must be, whether this doctrine of the common law is inconsistent with the rights and privileges of that constitution. Now; I am at a loss to discover, how perpetual allegiance to the government established in New-Jersey under the authority of the people, can be inconsistent with the rights of that charter which created and set in motion that very government. What is the true meaning of this exception in the 22d section? what are the rights secured by that charter? The principal are, a republican form of government; legislative council and general assembly; annual election; freedom of conscience in matters of religion; trial by jury, &amp;c. These are the rights alluded to; and it is easy to see that all those parts of the common law which grow out of the monarchy of England were inconsistent with these rights. But not so is that principle which would transfer the sacred duty of <span class="star-pagination">*317</span> allegiance, formerly due to the king, with equal force and effect to the new sovereign, the people themselves.</p>
<p>It was further stated that the preamble of the constitution asserts fundamental principles which are inconsistent with this common law notion of allegiance: Such as that all power is derived from the people Â— that protection and allegiance are reciprocal Â— that when a prince violates the fundamental laws he abdicates and dissolves the government, and remits the people to their primitive rights. Â— This is all very true; but it is equally true in England by the common law as here: it leaves the doctrine of allegiance where it was; but on great occasions transfers the duty of that allegiance from one man to another Â— or from one form of government to another. These principles were all recognized and acted upon in England in the revolution of 1688. But did that revolution change the doctrine of perpetual allegiance? No! it transferred it from James to William, but the law remained the same. The same turn was attempted to be given to this event in M`Donald's case, Foster, C.L. 60, but it was repelled by the court, not only as unfounded in law, but even as bringing a reproach on that glorious revolution. Then not being within the exception, it stands on the broad basis of the common law, which the people of New-Jersey have though proper to adopt, and which, I trust, they will not be soon persuaded to throw away.</p>
<p>3. But the common law doctrine of allegiance has been expressly enacted into our code by the legislature of New-Jersey. Wilson's N.J.L. 4. The treason act adopts the common law definition and division of allegiance in its very language and terms: "whereas, all persons abiding within this state, &amp;c. do owe allegiance to the government of this state and are to be deemed members thereof," and "all persons passing through, &amp;c. owe temporary allegiance." Here then we have an exact common law description of permanent and local allegiance. Afterwards the act proceeds to define the crime of treason, in which it pursues the provisions and uses the very words (mutatis mutandis) of the statute of Edward 3d. Now, what is the conclusion? The people, in their very constitution, adopt the common law Â— the legislature take up the common law idea and division of allegiance, and pursue even the English statute of treasons as far as it was in any manner applicable. <span class="star-pagination">*318</span> The common law import of the term allegiance being settled, it follows conclusively that the words must receive the same interpretation when introduced into the statute. That common law expressions must receive the common law exposition, is too clear to admit of doubt. Hence, we find that the advocates of the doctrine of expatriation have endeavoured, by all means, to get rid of them. It is matter of curiosity to look into 3 Dallas, 141, to see the pains the learned gentlemen who then first broached this doctrine, took to get rid of expressions having a fixed meaning by the common law. The terms allegiance and subject were thought to contain sounds discordant to the ears of a freeman: Obedience and citizenship were to be substituted. Allegiance was feudal Â— it denoted only the submission of a slave to his master. It was monarchical Â— unworthy a republican, who ought not to owe allegiance even to the people themselves Â— In short, it could not exist in a free country. The term subject was also disgraceful: A subject must have a master; that master must be a tyrant, and of course the appellation was only fit for slaves. But citizen was a name worthy of a freeman, and the true name by which a republican was to be known. The gentlemen shew their discretion in trying to get rid of terms of known signification and import, and substitute in their stead the most uncertain and vague. But, unfortunately for the argument in this case, the plain men who formed the constitution of New-Jersey were not carried away by such refinements. They supposed (perhaps weakly) that allegiance might be due to the people as well as to the king, and that even a republican might be called, without offence, a subject, provided his master was the law. Therefore, they adopted these terms of known signification; and these expressions must be explained according to their known and established legal import at the common law. But even if the common law and the constitution and law of New-Jersey did admit this idea of expatriation, it might be safely contended that Daniel Coxe never exercised the supposed right. An act of this kind to work such important consequences should be unequivocal, and certainly intended by the person to produce the effect. If it might exist consistently with the continuance of his former connections it shall not be construed to dissolve them. Now, his removal to England and remaining there ever since, is no act of expatriation. Having traded as a British merchant is not inconsistent with our position. <span class="star-pagination">*319</span> It has been determined in Westminster-Hall that a British subject naturalized here, is an American merchant within the treaty of 1794, and may, as such, trade to the East-Indies against the charter to that company. Neither can the fact of receiving compensation from the British government for losses during the war, be considered as an expatriation. That was common to all the royalists; yet those who returned have always been received as subjects on taking the oaths of allegiance. Much less can the circumstance of his calling himself a British subject alter his condition. If he had called himself an American citizen without right it would not make him such; so if he is really a subject of New-Jersey in the contemplation of the law of the state, his calling himself a subject of Great-Britain would not make him an alien to New-Jersey. But Mr. Coxe was correct in calling himself so; he was born such and is such; but the state of New-Jersey, by declaring him a subject, and punishing him as such, have also taken him as their subject; and by law have only done what is commonly produced by the act of the party; that is to say, created a kind of double allegiance; a matter which happens here every day in the case of the naturalized Englishmen.</p>
<p>The course I have pursued relieves me from the task of following the gentlemen through the general research they have made to support the right of expatriation. If the common law prohibits it; if the people of New-Jersey have adopted that common law, and the legislature enacted its provisions, it matters little what foreign jurists think of this question.</p>
<p>I will make but a few very general remarks.</p>
<p>1st. If the known maxims of the common law are to be disregarded and titles to land tested by the reasoning of modern writers, and by general principles of abstract right, the learned counsel against us have overlooked a very important point. They should have examined their own objection and tried how that would comport with the theory of modern times. The reasons on which the disability of an alien to hold lands is founded may be truly said to be more unsatisfactory than those on which the doctrine of allegiance is founded; and the policy of the United States, with such an immense wilderness to subdue, seems to <span class="star-pagination">*320</span> point out the propriety of inviting foreigners, by all the inducements which a clear right to hold lands brings with it, to populate that wilderness. The reasons for the exclusion were partly feudal, and all such have ceased to exist with that system; and partly political, and those rendered by my lord Coke are of little weight, and doubtful policy, since the extension of trade and the increase of money. But the gentlemen are reduced to the necessity again of being inconsistent; they adhere with inflexibility to one maxim to exclude our title, and repudiate another more important, clear, and settled, to effect the same purpose.</p>
<p>2d. If this thing called expatriation really exists as a right, it can only be founded on mutual consent. Not only the party who gives up his allegiance but the state must accede to it. This public consent can be expressed only in one way by law: Hence it follows that if the right, strictly speaking, exists, it must be dormant until put in motion by a law. This law will regulate the forms, settle the terms, and determine the consequences of expatriation. As it is now contended for, it is without any such restrictions. A man may shake off his allegiance one year and put it on again the next; it may go and come as often as whim and caprice shall dictate. The state of New-Jersey have never recognized by law this right; much less have they regulated it: until they have, it must remain useless and inoperative. No state in the union but Virginia has passed an act recognizing and regulating the right of expatriation.</p>
<p>3d. and lastly. The treaties between the United States and Great-Britain which have also been used against us, so far from aiding the gentlemen are against them. That of 1783, stipulates that no future loss shall happen on account of the part taken by those in the situation of Mr. Coxe, during the war. But if his right to inherit lands is taken from him for that reason, he has sustained a future loss. The only fair and liberal construction of this treaty is, that the royalists were by it restored to all rights which they possessed before, not actually divested and gone at the time of that treaty. The treaty of 1794 recognizes the idea that the antenati might hold lands and stipulates that their heirs may do the same. Both together, we apprehend, fully protect the right of Mr. Coxe. It could not be denied but that if Miss Coxe, the intestate, had been herself <span class="star-pagination">*321</span> a British subject, that Mr. Coxe might, within the very letter of that treaty, have claimed as her heir. It would be harsh indeed, to put him in a worse condition, because she was a subject. On the whole, it is submitted that the judgment below ought to be affirmed.</p>
<p>Ingersoll in reply. The doctrines advanced upon the present occasion are, to me, novel, strange, and alarming.</p>
<p>That the postnati, against whom we have no cause of complaint, should be excluded, while the antenati are preferred who injured us. That the French who aided us are called aliens, while the British loyalist refugee may hold lands as a citizen, is a language I do not understand. If the law is so, it is strange, and I must abandon an idea I have always cherished, that the rules of law were founded in sound sense.</p>
<p>Daniel Coxe being more than twenty-one years of age at the commencement of the revolution, adheres uniformly to the British interest in attempting to reduce the United States to submission to British claims. The attempt failing, at the conclusion of the war he quits this country, settles in England, claims to be a British subject, and is so acknowledged by that government from 1777, to 1805.</p>
<p>In 1802, a relative dies in New-Jersey, to whom Daniel Coxe is next of blood, and claims to succeed by right of descent as an American citizen. The next of blood, who is a citizen of the United States, excepts to him as an alien, and claims in her own right.</p>
<p>I make two questions in this cause.</p>
<p>1. Did Daniel Coxe expatriate himself? This question is naturally subdivided into two others; viz. Had he a right so to do? and has he exercised that right?</p>
<p>2. Did such expatriation incur the disability of alienage? and is he thereby prevented from taking lands by descent in the United States?</p>
<p>I ask, (and it is a question of magnitude) could Daniel Coxe, and has he expatriated himself and become a subject of the king of Great Britain?</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*322</span> This is a new case in the history of nations, to which the little case of Calvin, the Scotchman, bears no proportion.</p>
<p>The revolution which dismembered the mighty empire of Britain, is a subject of curious, of interesting Â— and as introductory on this occasion Â— of profitable contemplation. Its leading principle was the reverse of what has been stated by the opposite counsel, or I am ignorant of its origin and design.</p>
<p>I insist that when the authority of the mother country, as it was called, was rejected, the inhabitants of the former colonies were so far in a state of nature, that each man was at liberty to choose his side Â— remain a subject, or become a citizen. This interval of election continued until new systems of government were formed, adopted, and organized, after which period, (not previously) residence was an implied assent to share the fortunes and the destinies of the United States. In Pennsylvania the rule was practically exemplified in the memorable case of Chapman, the British light-horseman, charged with treason. 1 Dal. 53.</p>
<p>When government is regularly established, a majority with propriety governs the minority; to institute it legally, individual assent is necessary, or it deserves the name of usurpation, and ought to be execrated as tyranny. 1 Wilson's works, 316, 317.</p>
<p>New-Jersey proceeds in a temperate, mild and correct course. The constitution of the 2d of July, 1776, offers the right of suffrage without imposing its exercise on all the inhabitants. Constitution of New-Jersey, section 2, 3, 4, 13.</p>
<p>In perfect conformity to the principle for which I contend, treason could not be committed, even by joining an invading army, until after the 4th of October, 1776, Wilson's New-Jersey Laws, p. 4. The period is, in effect, extended by the provisions of the act of the 5th of June, 1777, offering to restore to the rights of freemen all who would return and comply with certain conditions by the 1st of August, then next.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*323</span> In 1777, Daniel Coxe joins the enemy as a fugitive and offender; and in August of the same year, an inquisition is held to forfeit his real estate for treason supposed to be committed about the 9th of April preceding and judgment was rendered thereon in February, 1779.</p>
<p>The counsel opposed to us exultingly say Daniel Coxe is by this means recognized as a citizen, charged with the crimes incident to that character only, and entitled in return to the privilege of holding land, and cite authorities in support of the position. Â— 1 Bl. Com. 371. 2 Bl. Com. 249.</p>
<p>We admit that he could take lands Â— so might an alien Â— but he could not hold in either capacity. In high treason the forfeiture of lands accrues not from the time of conviction, but from the date of the offence.</p>
<p>If the right of election had passed, the right of expatriation succeeded.</p>
<p>I am told at the commencement of the argument that I misunderstand and misapply terms, and consider as synonimous, what are entirely distinct, if not of opposite meaning, Expatriation and Emigration. That the last is of natural right, the former of municipal regulation. That emigration cannot be restrained, but expatriation requires the consent of the government. Emigration only suspends the activity of allegiance; expatriation dissolves it, precludes from taking lands, and renders the issue aliens.</p>
<p>This suggestion accords perfectly well with the views of my learned antagonist; but does he shew any authority in support of his explanation? None Â— it is the offspring of his own creative imagination.</p>
<p>Is it credible that the conventions of Pennsylvania, Kentucky, and Vermont thought it necessary to restrain their legislatures from preventing temporary absences of their citizens retaining their political connections within their respective states?</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*324</span> A train of reasoning is unnecessary on this point; 1 find the text and the comment together. 1 Wilson's works, 311. Tucker's Blackstone, vol, 1. part 2. Appendix, p. 96. Has a state the right to prohibit the emigration of its members? May a citizen dissolve the connection between him and his country? Judge Tucker considers expatriation and emigration of the same import. In Judge Wilson's works the word expatriation is not used in the whole lecture. The 9th article and 25th section of the constitution of Pennsylvania is introduced, and the whole course of argument shows the word emigration is to be understood as co-extensive with expatriation.</p>
<p>Taking the word emigration then in its most extensive sense, is the right of expatriation, as has been represented, the mere whim of modern, fanciful, theoretical writers? Â— I say it is as ancient as the society of man.</p>
<p>It is only by establishing the converse of the proposition, the common law idea that the natural born subject of one prince cannot, by swearing allegiance to another, or by any other act, discharge himself from his allegiance to the former, that the principle of emigration can be made a matter of doubt. 1 Tuck. Bl. part 2d. Appendix, p. 90. I deny that this common law principle is founded in, or consonant to the divine law, the law of nature, the law of nations, or the constitution of the state of New-Jersey. The bible is the most venerable book of antiquity; there we find expatriation practised, approved, and never restrained. The family of Jacob became subjects to the Egyptian monarch. Moses abandoned Egypt, his native land, and David left Saul, his prince.</p>
<p>The law of nature, abstractedly considered, knows neither prince nor subject. From this source, therefore, the common law principle cannot be derived.</p>
<p>Particular nations have prohibited their people from migrating to another country, but the prohibition did not arise from the practice of nations towards each other. At Athens, after a man examined the laws of <span class="star-pagination">*325</span> the republic, if he did not approve of them, he was at liberty to quit the country with his effects. By the constitution of the Roman commonwealth, no citizen could be forced to leave it, or not to leave it, when made a member of another which he preferred. Even under the emperors, as long as any remains of liberty continued, it was a rule that each one might chuse the state of which he wished to be a subject or citizen. Where did the Romans get their laws? From the Grecians. Where did the Grecians get their laws? From the eastern nations Â— the Aborigines of the earth. The right of expatriation, therefore, as far as we can trace it, has been recognized in the most remote antiquity. Among modern nations the practice is various; the Muscovites forbid it; in Switzerland it is permitted: some princes consider their subjects as riches Â— as flocks and herds, and their edicts correspond to these false notions. Vattel b. 1, c. 19, Â§ 225. Consult jurists, Grotius, Puffendorff, Burlamaqui, Vattel, they are of opinion, that every man has a natural right to migrate, unless restrained by laws, and that these cannot restrain the right but under special circumstances, and to a limited degree. The strong and masculine understanding of Mr. Locke revolted at the illiberal ideas of English jurisprudence in this particular; he examined the right claimed to prohibit emigration, and declares that examples of emigration are frequent in history profane and sacred, and that it has been the practice from the begining of the world to the time he wrote. Wyckefort has a section, the title of which is, the prince may employ foreigners in his embassies, even in their own country. Wyckefort, p. 116, 119. After a narrative in which he shows, that this had been the practice of Europe, he proceeds to consider its propriety, which he infers from the right of expatriation. Mr. Rawle has read as cited, that passage to which Mr. Tilghman did not refer, and omitted to answer what Mr. Tilghman did read.</p>
<p>Lastly the constitution of New-Jersey, is founded on sentiments which repel the idea of perpetual allegiance, and imply and include the right of expatriation.</p>
<p>Whatever diversity there may have been in the sentiments <span class="star-pagination">*326</span> of writers, and in the laws and practices of states on the subject of emigration in general, there never has been a doubt in this country, but that when a civil war takes place, each member of the society has a right to choose his side.</p>
<p>The first view we have of New-Jersey and Daniel Coxe, is in a state of enmity, the state treating him as a refugee; Daniel Coxe declaring himself a British subject, acting in concert with an invading army.</p>
<p>Trace the circumstances distinctly, and we shall find the right of election between the two governments restored to him, and that he expatriates himself with the consent of, if not propelled thereto by the state of New-Jersey.</p>
<p>On the 11th of December 1778, the legislature of New-Jersey passed an act whereby they disfranchise all persons who were of the character and had pursued the conduct of Daniel Coxe. At the treaty of peace, his treason was cancelled, forgiven, buried in oblivion, or at least remembered only to prevent restitution of his forfeited estates. The disfranchising act continued in full operation, unrepealed, and unaffected by the restoration of harmony between the two countries. Under these circumstances he had his choice; he might have returned to New-Jersey, or to any other state. The principles of the constitution justified him in becoming a British subject, within the rules of expatriation, as stated by the opposite counsel. That he made his choice is proved by unequivocal evidence, that leaves no room for doubt or controversy as to the fact.</p>
<p>Mr. Rawle has himself enumerated eight heads, under which the evidence of his expatriating himself, and becoming a British subject may be classed. 1. Joining the British army in 1777. 2. Voluntary residence with them at Philadelphia and New-York. 3. Holding civil offices under the king. 4. Trading as a British merchant. 5. Holding lands as a trustee. 6. Receiving pensions and rewards as a British subject. 7. Describing himself as such. 8. Having never taken an oath of allegiance to the state of New-Jersey.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*327</span> A case was cited (Wilson v. Marryat, 1 Bos. &amp; Pul. 430) to shew that the exercise of trade as a citizen of one country, is compatible with a continuance of allegiance to another. It was the case of John Collet, who was under the supposed tie not only of permanent, but perpetual allegiance from birth. But Daniel Coxe was not born in the allegiance of the state of New-Jersey, nor ever voluntarily took upon himself that obligation. The principle of that decision is consonant to British ideas, but in direct hostility with those which led to the American revolution, gave birth to our constitutions, and without which our brightest patriots were rebels.</p>
<p>It is impossible to doubt from what appears on the record, that he is under repeated positive oaths of allegiance to the king of Great Britain. According to the sound reasoning of Wyckefort, these were sufficient to sever the strongest connection between the United States and a citizen, much more such a relation as was subsisting (if any) between the state of New-Jersey and Daniel Coxe; involuntary, disclaimed, and inconsistent with the duties imposed upon him by his engagements to another country.</p>
<p>The naturalization law of congress is full proof that in the estimation of the people of the United States, an oath of allegiance to one country is an expatriation from a former; and that whoever becomes a citizen here, ceases ipso facto, to be a subject elsewhere. If this is not the meaning of our law, we encourage the unhappy victims to sacrifice themselves at the shrine of perjury. Characters, such as Mr. Coxe are considered by the same law, as expatriated, as aliens, and being no longer citizens; he having been attainted of treason by the state of Pennsylvania in the year 1778.</p>
<p>By the naturalization act of April 14th, 1802, 6 vol, Laws of United States, p. 74, 80, Â§ 4, attainted loyalists, and such as have been legally convicted of having joined the army of Great Britain during the late war, cannot be naturalized without the consent of the legislature of the state, in which such persons were proscribed. All the courts of the United States, therefore, <span class="star-pagination">*328</span> could not naturalize Daniel Coxe, without the consent of the states of New-Jersey and Pennsylvania, in both of which he has been proscribed.</p>
<p>From all these considerations, it is inferred that Daniel Coxe did expatriate himself; that he had a right so to do; Â— that he has legally exercised that right, and has thereby become a British subject, and is not an American citizen.</p>
<p>Did such expatriation induce the disability of alienage, and is Daniel Coxe thereby incapacitated from taking lands in the United States by descent?</p>
<p>We are charged with inconsistency, that while we endeavour to exclude the liberal sentiments of the common law as applied to antenati, we insist on the rigid rule of the same law, in preventing aliens from holding lands in the United States.</p>
<p>This charge will be effectually repelled by a single passage, from an authority cited by the opposite counsel for a different purpose. 1 Tucker's Bl. part 2d.p. 371. If an alien could acquire a permanent property in lands, he must owe an allegiance, equally permanent with that property, to the king of England, inconsistent perhaps with former allegiance, and productive of many other inconveniences. By the civil law a contract for land by an alien is void. The forfeiture to the prince is peculiar to England, or at least to countries where the feudal system has prevailed. 1 Bl. Com. 371. Cod. l. 11, tit. 55.</p>
<p>Was it from deference to the common law, that the objections urged against the treaty of London were, that it paved the way for British influence, by enabling aliens of that country to hold lands in the United States?</p>
<p>If the natural and primitive allegiance may be put off without the consent or concurrent act of the prince to whom it was first due, expatriation must induce alienage.</p>
<p>Virginia has recognized the right, and considers the <span class="star-pagination">*329</span> person who has exercised it, as no longer a citizen. Tuck. Bl. part 2, p. 360, 361.</p>
<p>If expatriation be a right when legally exercised, it must induce alienage, and the revolution is a case in point, to show that a man is not obliged to continue the subject of that prince under whose dominion he was born; otherwise, contrary to a position contended for by Mr. Rawle, we must admit that America was not independent until the king of Great Britain acknowledged her independence; and that it was the consequence of, and not antecedent to, the treaty of peace.</p>
<p>Expatriation is substantially a putting off or change of allegiance. As to the removal from one country to another, it is a mere immaterial, accidental circumstance. It will be agreed that if it can be done in the country, it can by going out of the country.</p>
<p>Nations may shake off their allegiance, says Mr. Rawle, but individuals may not. Grotius said just the contrary; and surely, as Judge Tucker observes, if all might, any one might, with the same reason.</p>
<p>Granting for a moment that the common law of England is as barbarous as the case of M`Donald, (Foster 59) would induce us to suppose, how has it been translated to the United States, to be in active operation, slandering the principles of our revolution. I consider the case of Talbot v. Janson as establishing the proposition that expatriation was a right, the fair exercise of which produced alienage with its respective rights and disabilities. Â— 3 Dall. 133, 152, 164.</p>
<p>Of Hamilton and Eden I know nothing. Lord Fairfax's case is not in print, but from what fell from his honor Judge Washington, I presume it went upon similar grounds to that of Calvin. I throw into the opposite scale, as at least an equal weight, the decision in the case of the Charming Betsy, where expatriation was expressly recognized, and as operating the extinguishment of the previous character of citizen of the United States. It is in point as to both particulars.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*330</span> I conceive the general rule, at least so far as it is necessary in the instance of Daniel Coxe, is fully established, and that expatriation is a right, which, when fairly exercised, changes the allegiance; and that it has been so exercised, by which he ceased to be an American citizen, became an alien, and as such incapable of holding lands by purchase, or taking by consent, unless there be an exception out of the rule in his favor, as an antenatus.</p>
<p>The burden of the argument devolves upon our antagonists. Let them show when, and by what means, the exception in favor of the antenatus, derived from the principle of perpetual allegiance by birth, has been adopted among us.</p>
<p>Because, say the counsel for the defendant in error, the constitution of New-Jersey adopted the common law, of which this is a part, therefore the rule is imperative on this occasion. What! all the common law of England? that which respects the royal prerogative, the hierarchy, the idea that allegiance is personal to the king from the subject, not duty on the part of the citizen to the state.</p>
<p>The common law of England, say Judge Tucker and Judge Wilson, was only so far adopted in the states, as it was proper and applicable to the situation and the circumstances of the colonies; and was different in different colonies.</p>
<p>The adoption by New-Jersey is guardedly expressed. "The common and statute law of England, as have "been heretofore practised in this colony, not repugnant "to the rights contained in this charter, shall be "in force."</p>
<p>Two questions arise for the consideration of the opposite counsel. Was the principle for which they contend in previous practice in New-Jersey? Is it not repugnant to the privileges contained in that charter?</p>
<p>A double task devolves on our opponents. They must shew that what they ask, was in practice in the <span class="star-pagination">*331</span> colony of New-Jersey before the formation of the constitution. This is impossible; the case could not occur; it could not, in the nature of things, be in contemplation of the convention. The expression had reference to the mere detail of municipal law. Here then our antagonists must fail.</p>
<p>Can they succeed better in the other part of the proposition? Is not a claim, founded on the idea of perpetual allegiance by birth, repugnant to the rights and privileges contained in that charter?</p>
<p>They say, on the contrary, that allegiance and protection are reciprocalties, and claim, as a right and privilege, to refuse the former when the latter is withdrawn.</p>
<p>Three, out of seventeen states, says Mr. Rawle, have declared emigration a right not to be restrained by the legislatures. I say it is the principle of the revolution; it pervades each and every constitution, without which the whole proceeding is crime, rebellion, and treason.</p>
<p>If the common law, introduced through the constitution, fails, what is the next prop by which it is attempted to support a claim in opposition to the language of our revolution?</p>
<p>We are told that the capacity of British subjects to hold lands in the United States is recognized by the treaties of 1783 and 1794, and that surely it was not meant to encourage them to purchase that we might escheat. This part of the argument is introduced by a reference to Judge Tucker for the distinction between aliens by birth and aliens by election. 1 Tuck. Bl. part 2, page 102, s. 2. Â— I acknowledge that Judge Tucker does state, that, by the treaty of peace, the common-law principle that the antenati of both countries were natural born to both, and as such, capable of holding, or inheriting, seems to be revived. Â— As far as respects authority, I oppose to Judge Tucker, the Virginia assembly, who expressly declare that all persons not being citizens of the United States are aliens. 1 Tuck. Bl. part 2, page 55. Judge Tucker founds himself, as to the common-law principle, upon Bracton and Calvins case, not adverting to the difference in point of fact, that the British who claim, as in this instance, never were in allegiance to our states.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*332</span> Further, he does not observe that the whole reasoning is founded upon the false hypothesis that allegiance by birth is perpetual. He acknowledges that by the declaration of independence the colonies became a separate nation from Great Britain; yet, according to the laws of England which we still retained, the natives of both countries, born-before the separation, retained all the rights of birth. War makes aliens enemies. They were enemies Â— then aliens.</p>
<p>With the New-Jersey convention I understand the matter differently; and that the law of England ceased until revived; and was revived only as heretofore practised.</p>
<p>On this mistaken ground it is, as I shall endeavour to shew, that he infers that American natives were capable of inheriting lands in England, and the natives of England of inheriting lands in America.</p>
<p>If this doctrine is founded upon the idea of perpetual allegiance by birth, it must stand or fall with its principal.</p>
<p>Commentators, it is said, often find in Homer, what Homer never thought. It appears to me that the same observation applies to the commentaries we have heard upon the treaties of 1783 and 1794.</p>
<p>Let it be recollected that congress on the 27th of November, 1777, earnestly recommended it to the several states to confiscate and make sale of all the real and personal estate of such of their inhabitants, and other persons, as had forfeited the same.</p>
<p>The legislatures did confiscate the lands of antenati as escheated, and it was never suggested to be a violation of the common-law of the land. In order, however, to vest the property in lands of an alien in the commonwealth, offices of intitling, and of instruction, were necessary in some states.</p>
<p>In some states acts of assembly declared that the estates of the persons proceeded against should be vested and adjudged to be in the actual possession of the commonwealth without any other office or inquisition. In others, real property belonging to British subjects, loyalists, and others, had been only sequestered, not confiscated, <span class="star-pagination">*333</span> and the profits appropriated during the war; the estate to wait the disposal of the legislative provision on the return of peace. In some instances the lands of loyalists and others had not been actually seized and taken into the possession of the states respectively where situated, and therefore the forfeitures and confiscations were not considered as completed. In these several ways real property remained to loyalists and others which was considered as not yet confiscated. This is the key to unlock the secrets of the provision in the treaty.</p>
<p>I contend, therefore, that the, 6th article of the treaty of 3d September, 1783, as far as respects property, is confined in its letter, spirit, and meaning, to the preservation of estates owned antecedently to the war, which had not been actually confiscated and seized; and to the consequences of an active part taken during that period.</p>
<p>This construction is perfectly warranted by the case decided in Connecticut, (Kirby's Reports) and by the principles as laid down by that very eminent English lawyer, Woodeson.</p>
<p>The distinction of antenati and postnati, the security of future acquisition, or the operation of general principles arising from political situations not the penal consequences of an active part taken in the war, were not then in contemplation.</p>
<p>Twelve millions of rich aliens allowed to purchase lands in a country owned by two or three millions of people comparatively poor: would it not have been thought madness! I conceive that this clause is precisely co-extensive as to its objects in guarding against injury to the person and to the property. It preserves from injury to their property the same persons who were to be secured in their personal liberty.</p>
<p>In the first place, this comprehended many who were considered as citizens of the United-States, but who had committed crimes against their country.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*334</span> Was the property to be restored to them at one moment, says Mr. Rawle, for the purpose of being taken from them the next? Â— By no means. The stipulations extend to preclude any criminal proceedings for what had been done during the war. The effect of alienage was left to considerations of policy. Our commissioners, I trust, would not have suffered any interference by the British on that head.</p>
<p>This article was intended to prevent punishment, not to secure reward. If the loyalist is put upon the same footing as the ally in the war, he has no cause of complaint.</p>
<p>There must be no future loss; no damage by reason of the part which any have taken during the war. It is not asked. If Daniel Coxe had fought under general Washington and at the peace expatriated himself, and become a British subject, the rule for which we contend would have been equally applicable. Many of the people came back, and were naturalized under acts of assembly, and of course hold their lands; such as Mr. Gordon in Pennsylvania, and others.</p>
<p>The construction of the treaty attempted by our opponents, can only be maintained by reference to the common law doctrine, that natives of Great Britain were constructively born in America.</p>
<p>The 5th article assists in the construction of the 6th, and is recommendatory where the confiscation laws had been actually carried into effect. The 9th article of the treaty of the 19th of November, 1794, is in perfect unison with the ideas I submitted to the consideration of the court. Different ideas had been entertained in the different states as to the policy of permitting aliens to hold lands. It was always a matter of state regulation. In Pennsylvania they might purchase; Â— now they may take by descent.</p>
<p>The treaty, therefore, so far from looking to future acquisitions by purchase, is confined to those who now hold.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*335</span> It is observable that Judge Tucker does not express himself decidedly. He uses the qualified and guarded expression that the treaty seems to have revived the common law principle that the antenati of both countries were natural born to both. He qualifies his argument still further, by saying, British subjects born since the separation are aliens; but such of them as were born before the definitive treaty of peace took place seem to be entitled to the benefits thereof, so far as they had, or might be presumed to have, any interest in lands in the United States. All others appear to be aliens in the strictest sense of the word, except as their cases may have been remedied by the late treaty of the 19th Nov. 1794.</p>
<p>Daniel Coxe had no interest in lands in the United States, and could not be presumed to have, on the 3d of September, 1783.</p>
<p>It is curious to observe the unreasonable consequences to which this doctrine of antenatus leads.</p>
<p>If the loyalist died and left an unoffending infant, his lands escheat.</p>
<p>If he leaves an antenatus who had waged war against us, he succeeds to the possession.</p>
<p>Say with Judge. Tucker that under the equity of the treaty of peace, giving it the most liberal construction, all rights of British subjects, actually vested, not divested, were protected; and that when such rights relate to lands, the persons having such right, if not then citizens, had their whole life time to become citizens; which, if they neglected to do, their lands at their deaths would be equally subject to escheat as those of any alien naturalized, and dying without heirs other than aliens. How is this reconcileable with his doctrine of antenati being entitled to purchase, take by descent, and every other mode of acquisition? Or, with his argument that the common law principle from which this doctrine of antenati flows, that of perpetual allegiance by birth, has never been translated as a part of the common law into the United States? How can he reconcile it to his consure <span class="star-pagination">*336</span> and strictures upon the determination of Judge Ellsworth in Williams's case? He himself acknowledges that after the 28th of October, 1795, no British subject can purchase lands within the United States, so as to be protected by that treaty.</p>
<p>If once this whimsical doctrine of antenatus be admitted it will give rise to an infinity of perplexing questions.</p>
<p>An attainted loyalist, if he retains his citizenship may return and be immediately eligible as a member of the house of representatives or the senate. After 14 years residence, though he cannot be naturalized without the consent of the state in which he was proscribed, yet he may be president of the United States.</p>
<p>I inter from all these considerations that the expatriation of Daniel Coxe induced the forfeiture of alienage, and that he is thereby precluded from taking lands by descent in the United States of America.<sup>[*]</sup></p>

<p>[Â†]  This case was decided by the Supreme Court of Connecticut, before Richard Law, Ch. J. Oliver Elsworth, Roger Sherman, and William, Pitkin, Justices, and was as follows.
</p>
<p>An estate was mortgaged by Fitch to Stephen Apthorp, then of Bristol in England, who died January 1st, 1773, leaving the plaintiff his only heir. It was moved in arrest of judgment, that it appears by the declaration that the plaintiff is an alien, and therefore, cannot by law, hold any real estate.</p>
<p>By the Court.</p>
<p>A state may exclude aliens from acquiring property within it of any kind, as its safety or policy may direct; as England has done with regard to real property, saving, that in favour of commerce, alien merchants may hold leases of houses and stores, and may, for recovery of their debts. extend lands, and hold them, and upon ouster have an assize. Dyer 2. 6. Bac. Ab. 84. But it would be against right that a division of a state or kingdom, should work a forfeiture of property previously acquired under its laws, and that by its own citizens; which is the case here.</p>
<p>The plaintiff's title to the land accrued while she was not an alien, nor could she be affected by the disability of an alien, but was as much a citizen of the now state of Connecticut, as any person at present within it, and her descent was cast under its laws.</p>
<p>Her title is also secured by the treaty of peace, which stipulates that there shall be no further forfeitures or confiscations on account of the war, upon either side. The subsequent statute of this state, declaring aliens incapable of purchasing or holding lands in this state, does not affect the plaintiff's title, otherwise than by recognizing and enforcing it, for it hath a proviso that "the act shall not be construed to work a "forfeiture of any lands, which belonged to any subjects of the king of "Great Britain before the late war, or to prevent proprietors of such "lands, from selling and disposing of the same to any inhabitant of any "of the United States." It is not indeed expressly said, that the proprietors of such lands may maintain actions for the possession of them, but this is clearly implied; for lands without the possession are of no use; and whenever the law gives or admits a right, it gives or admits also every thing incident thereto, as necessary to the enjoyment and exercise of that right; and besides, they cannot sell their lands till they first get possession of them; for all sales of land in this state, whereof the grantor is dispossessed, except to the person in possession, are, by express statute, void: so that the plaintiff is not barred of her title, or right of action, either at common law or by statute</p>

<center>February 22, 1804.</center>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*36</span> <i>Ingersoll,</i> for plaintiff in error.</p>
<p><i>Lincoln, attorney-general of the U.S. and Dallas for defendant in error.</i></p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*51</span> MARSHALL, Chief Justice, delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
<p>In this case a single point is presented to the court. The plaintiff in error was a refiner of sugar, in the city of Philadelphia, and had a large quantity of refined sugars in his refinery, on the 1st of July, 1802.</p>
<p>In April, 1802, Congress passed an act to repeal the internal taxes. The first section of the repealing law enacts "that from and after the 30th day of June next, the internal duties," &amp;c.</p>
<p>To recover the duty on sugars refined <i>before</i> the 30th of June, and sent out <i>afterwards,</i> this action was brought. The single question is, Whether the duty had then accrued, and was on that day outstanding? This is admitted on both sides; and the repealing law is to be construed, as if it had passed on the 30th of June, to take effect immediately, and the proviso had been expressed in words of the present tense, thus, "provided, that for the recovery and receipt of such duties as have now accrued, and now remain outstanding, the provisions of the aforesaid act shall remain in full force and virtue."</p>
<p>Had the duty accrued, and was it outstanding in contemplation of the legislature, on sugars refined, but not sent out of the building in which the operation was performed?</p>
<p>The solution of this question depends on the construction of the act by which the duty was imposed.</p>
<p>This act passed in June 1794, and is entitled "an act laying certain duties on snuff and refined sugars." The first section imposes a duty on snuff, which shall be manufactured after the 30th of September then next ensuing, and the second section is in these words, "And be it further enacted, that from and after the said 30th day of September next, there be <i>levied, collected</i> <span class="star-pagination">*52</span> <i>and paid</i> upon all sugar which shall be refined within the United States, a duty of two cents per pound.</p>
<p>The fourth section of the act contains provisions respecting the duty on snuff, and the fifth section, after making several regulations requiring the refiner of sugars to report the building and utensils to be employed in the manufacture, and to give bond with condition that he shall keep books in which he shall enter daily the sugars refined, as well as those sent out, proceeds to enact, "that he shall on the 1st day of <i>January, April, July,</i> and <i>October,</i> in each year, render a just and true account of all the refined sugar, which he or she shall have sent out, or caused, or procured to be sent out, from the first time of his or her entry and report aforesaid, until the day which shall first ensue, of the days above mentioned, for the rendering of such account, and thenceforth successively, from the time when such account ought to have been, and up to which it shall have been last rendered, until the day next thereafter, of the days above mentioned, for the rendering of such account, producing and showing therewith the original book or paper, whereon the entries, from day to day, to be made as aforesaid, have been made: and he or she shall, at the time of rendering each account, pay or secure the duties, which by this act ought to be paid upon the refined sugar in the said account mentioned."</p>
<p>Other sections of this act have been relied on by the counsel on both sides, and the phraseology of the law, in other acts said to be <i>in pari materia</i> has been brought into view. They have not been unnoticed by the court in forming the opinion now to be delivered; but as the case depends principally on the just construction of the sections which have been quoted, those sections only are stated for the present.</p>
<p>That a law is the best expositor of itself, that every part of an act is to be taken into view, for the purpose of discovering, the mind of the legislature; and that the details of one part may contain regulations restricting the extent of general expressions used in another part of the same act, are among those plain rules laid down by common sense for the exposition of statutes <span class="star-pagination">*53</span> which have been uniformly acknowledged. If by the application of these rules it shall appear, that the duty on refined sugars did "accrue, and was outstanding" before the article was sent out of the building, then the refiner is unquestionably liable to pay it, notwithstanding the repeal of the law by which it was imposed.</p>
<p>To support the proposition, that the duty did accrue, the words of the second section of the act for imposing it, have been relied on. These words are, "that from and after the 30th day of September next, there be <i>levied, collected and paid</i> upon all sugar which shall be refined within the United states, a duty of two cents per pound." These words, it is said, contain an express charge upon all the sugars to be refined within the United States.</p>
<p>It is admitted by the counsel for the plaintiff in error, that such would be the operation of the section if unexplained, and not restrained by other parts of the law.</p>
<p>In order to determine the influence which other sections must necessarily have on this, it is proper to ascertain with precision the import of the words which have been stated.</p>
<p>"There shall be <i>levied, collected and paid,</i>" &amp;c. Each of these words implies a charge upon the article, and if either of them had been used singly, no doubt could have been entertained that the article would have been burthened with the tax. They present to the mind distinct ideas, and when used together seem to designate distinct actions required by the law.</p>
<p>It would not, perhaps, be assuming more than is warranted to say, that either of them exclusively imports the creation and imposition of the duty. The word <i>levy</i> is selected for this purpose; and yet, in the succeeding section, the term is again used with a reference to that now under consideration, and very plainly designates the duty of the officer, not the operation of the act. The words of the third section are, "that the duties aforesaid shall be levied, collected and accounted for by the same officers," &amp;c. The meaning <span class="star-pagination">*54</span> of the term in this section is by no means equivocal, and there does not appear sufficient ground for saying, that it was used by the legislature in the preceding section in a different sense. Unquestionably the requisition that a duty shall be levied, collected or paid, implies the existence of that duty: it seems to be as clearly implied by the one term as by the other. But, however, this may be, they act on the same subject and at the same time. The object of each verb is precisely the same. "There shall be levied" Â— on what? On "all sugars to be refined within the United States." There shall be "collected and paid" Â— from and on what? "all sugars to be refined within the United States." It has then been very correctly said, that these words, though not synonimous, are certainly as they stand in the sentence, co-extensive in their operation. They reach and embrace the same article at the same time. If then the other parts of the act demonstrate, that the words collected and paid, have not for their object all sugars to be refined, this section is necessarily restrained in its operation by those which follow and designate more particularly what is in the first instance expressed in general terms.</p>
<p>That such is the real effect of the law is acknowledged. It is admitted by the counsel for the defendant in error, that the duties are not to be collected and paid on all sugars to be refined, but on all sugars to be refined <i>and sent out</i> of the building. It follows then, that the general terms of the second section were intended by the legislature to be understood, in like manner, as if their intent had been expressly qualified, by adding the words "according to the regulations herein after prescribed;" or other words of similar import.</p>
<p>But admitting this view of the case to be correct, the great difficulty remains to be solved. It is contended by the defendant in error, that the fifth section neither imposes a duty, nor restrains to a more limited object the duty which was before imposed, and that its only effect is to prescribe the time of <i>payment</i> Â— that the duty on the article, taking the two sections together, constitutes a <i>present debt to be paid in future.</i></p>
<p>On the other hand the plaintiff in error insists that <span class="star-pagination">*55</span> the general terms of the second section, are defined and restricted by the fifth, as well with respect to the object of the tax, as to the <i>time of its collection and payment.</i></p>
<p>The court has felt great difficulty on this point. It is one on which the most correct minds may form opposite opinions, without exciting surprise. After the most attentive examination of the laws and the arguments of counsel, a judgment has at length been formed, differing from that rendered in the circuit court.</p>
<p>The object of the act imposing the duty being revenue, and not to discourage manufactures, it is reasonable to suppose that the attention of the legislature would be devoted to the article in that state in which it was designed to be productive of revenue. There could be no motive for imposing a duty never to be collected, or for imposing it on the article in that condition, in which it might remain forever, without yielding a cent to the treasury. The duty not being progressive, but complete in the instant of its commencement, being one entire thing, no purpose was to be effected by charging it on an object, from which it was not afterwards to be drawn.</p>
<p>If therefore, we find the whole attention of the legislature directed to the article in one state, if we find it productive only in one state, there is no reason for supposing, unless the words require that construction, that the duty was imposed upon it in a different state.</p>
<p>All those provisions of the act, which are calculated to bring the money arising from this tax, into the treasury, or to create any liability in the person who is to pay it, apply exclusively to sugars sent out of the building.</p>
<p>Of those sugars only is an account to be rendered; on those only are the duties to be paid or secured. It can scarcely be imagined that the legislature, if imposing a duty on all sugars refined, should entirely neglect to take any means whatever, to secure the collection of that duty, and should postpone those means until a subsequent event should happen, which might never occur.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*56</span> It is argued by the counsel for the defendant in error, that the happening of this event was certain, and that it was unnecessary for the legislature to perform any act which might occasion it, because the interest of the refiner, was a sure pledge for his sending out the sugars he had refined.</p>
<p>This is true, but the argument is not less strong when urged to prove, that the legislature might rely on this interest to produce the state of things, which would create the charge. If this interest was relied upon, for the fact on which a duty should become payable, it might well be relied upon to produce the fact on which the article should be chargeable with the duty; and it is unquestionably in the common course of legislative proceedings on the subject of revenue, to obtain security for the payment of duties, at the first convenient time after they shall have accrued.</p>
<p>If, as is contended for the defendant in error, the act of refining the sugar, creates a debt to be paid when sent out of the building, then the refiner becomes immediately the debtor of the government, and his situation by sending out the sugar, is changed in no other respect whatever, than that the debt before created does by that fact become payable. The position to be proved is that A, the refiner of sugars, becomes the debtor of the United States, to the full amount of the sugars refined, which debt does not accrue but only becomes payable on the fact of their being sent out of the building.</p>
<p>Let this proposition be examined.</p>
<p>If A becomes the debtor by the mere act of refining, then he remains the debtor until he shall be legally discharged. Suppose him to part with his manufactory and his capital stock, there being at the time of transfer a quantity of refined sugars in the building, which pass with it to the purchaser. If, by the act of refining, A became the debtor of the government, which debt became payable whenever the sugars should be sent out of the building, then A would remain the debtor-notwithstanding his sale, and would be liable for <span class="star-pagination">*57</span> those duties, if the purchaser should send them out without rendering any account of them, or securing their payment.</p>
<p>Yet this construction would be admitted to conflict with the obvious meaning of the law. Not only the person who sends out the sugars, is to account and pay for them, but if he fails to do so, the consequences of his failure fall entirely on himself. The sugar is forfeited, and if lost to the purchaser, his recourse could only be against the person from whom he purchased.</p>
<p>But let it be supposed, that A sends out his sugars and parts with his building, before the day on which the account is to be rendered, and the duties paid or secured. Who then would be the debtor of the government? Who in that case would be liable for the duties that had thus accrued? It is believed that only one answer could be given to this question. The person who sent out the sugars, would unquestionably be liable for the duties on them, and if they should be seized for the non-payment of them, the purchaser would have recourse to him for compensation.</p>
<p>If these positions be correct, it would seem to be a plain and necessary deduction from them, that the fact of sending out the sugars, not the fact of refining them, created the debt, and that the person sending them out became the debtor.</p>
<p>It has been argued that the provision of the 5th section, which requires a daily entry to be made on the books, of the quantity of sugars refined, evidences an intention in the legislature, to impose a tax on the article immediately. But this argument did not appear to be much relied on, and it is too apparent that the regulations of the 5th section were designed to furnish the means of detecting any fraud which might be attempted, in the account of sugars sent out of the building, to require that the court should employ any time in demonstrating the correctness of that construction.</p>
<p>The argument drawn from the 3d section, which uses the expression "the duties aforesaid," does not <span class="star-pagination">*58</span> appear to operate more in favour of the construction contended for by the counsel for the defendant in error. The section is employed not in designating the tax to be collected, but the person to collect it, and the words have the same import, as if instead of "the duties aforesaid," the language had been changed and the words, "the duties imposed by this act" had been used.</p>
<p>The sections respecting drawbacks have been relied on by both plaintiff and defendant, as completely supporting his own construction of the act, but the court can perceive nothing in those sections in any degree affecting the case.</p>
<p>It has been stated by both parties, that all the revenue acts of the United States, may be considered as <i>in pari materia,</i> as forming one connected system, and therefore to be compared together, when any one of them is to be construed.</p>
<p>In pursuance of this doctrine they have been resorted to by the defendant in error, to show that the terms used in the 2d section of the act under consideration are such as in all those acts import the imposition of a duty.</p>
<p>This is not questioned. It is not denied that a tax is imposed, nor would this have been denied if two of the three words used in the act had been omitted. It is the general phraseology of laws enacted for the purpose of raising money, but to reason by way of analogy, from the acts quoted to that under consideration, it would be necessary to show, that these general terms had been construed to be more extensive than the particular regulations, which follow for the purpose of carrying them into execution. It is not recollected that this has been attempted.</p>
<p>It has been argued that the duty on spirits of the home manufactory, is laid on their distillation, not on their removal, and that the legislature must therefore be presumed also, to have imposed the duty on sugars, on the act of refining them, and not on the act of removal.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*59</span> But the force of this argument is not admitted. Those political motives which induce the legislature to select objects of revenue and to tax them under particular circumstances, are not for judicial consideration. Where the legislature distinguishes between different objects, and in imposing a duty on them evidences a will to charge them in different situations, it is not for the courts to beat down these distinctions on the allegation that they are capriciously made, and therefore to be disregarded. It is the duty of the court to discover the intention of the legislature, and to respect that intention. Where the provisions of two acts are so unlike each other, that the comparison exhibits only a contrast, instead of saying that their opposing regulations were designed to be similar, it would seem much more reasonable to say that the one act exhibits a legislative mind materially variant in the particulars where the difference exists from what is exhibited by the other.</p>
<p>Every regulation of the act imposing a duty on spirits distilled within the United States, respects exclusively the time of distillation, and they are all essentially variant from the regulations of the act imposing a duty on snuff and refined sugars.</p>
<p>The duty on spirits is to be paid or secured previous to their removal. That on sugars is not to be paid or secured until after their removal.</p>
<p>The credit for the duties on distilled spirits is allowed from the date of a bond, to be quarter annually given for all the spirits distilled whether removed or not, so that the credit is as near as possible from the date of distillation.</p>
<p>The credit for the duties on refined sugars is allowed from the date of a bond quarter annually given for all the sugars removed from the building, so that the credit is as near as possible from the date of the removal.</p>
<p>Spirits having a duty imposed on them at the time of distillation are liable to seizure and confiscation if removed without paying or securing the duty.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*60</span> Sugars not being liable for the duty till removed are not seizable nor confiscable unless the refiner, after removal, shall have failed to pay or secure the duties which became payable at a given day after their removal.</p>
<p>With respect to country stills, the tax is laid on the capacity of the still, and is to be paid without regard to the quantity distilled, but if this tax should become oppressive it may be discharged by paying the duty on the quantity actually distilled. In this case no respect whatever is paid to the removal of the spirits. Their distillation alone attracts the attention of the legislature.</p>
<p>With respect to all refined sugars no duty can ever be demanded, unless the demand be predicated on the fact of removal.</p>
<p>Spirits being chargeable with the duty when distilled cannot be removed without a permit.</p>
<p>Sugars being only chargeable when sent out may be removed at the will of the refiner.</p>
<p>It is going very far indeed to argue a sameness of intention from these dissimilar regulations. The court thinks it much more correct to say that the intention of the legislature with respect to these different objects was entirely different, and that in the case of spirits the duty was imposed on the distillation, while in the case of sugars the duty was imposed on the removal.</p>
<p>It is not improbable that the difference in the progress made in the two pursuits, and the greater degree of forbearance required by the one than by the other; or that the difference in the facility with which frauds might be practised in the two cases, might occasion this apparent difference in the time of imposing the duty on the article. But this, it is repeated, is a legislative not a judicial inquiry and, if the difference exists, it must be respected, whatever may be the motives which produced it.</p>
<p>Some arguments have been drawn from the repealing law which have too much weight to be unnoticed.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*61</span> It has been said that the provisions intended as a guard, to prevent frauds in the collection of duties on sugars sent out of the building, are dispensed with so far as respects sugars refined before the 30th of <i>June,</i> but sent out after that day, and from thence it is argued that the legislature could not have supposed sugars under such circumstances to be liable to a duty. The weight of this argument if supported by the fact, is so apparent that the counsel for the defendant in error, controverts the fact itself, and not the inference drawn from that fact, if it be correctly stated.</p>
<p>It is and must be admitted, that the first part of the first section of the repealing law does away any forfeiture which was to be produced by the future operation of the act repealed. If therefore such forfeiture is retained, it must be by virtue of the saving in the subsequent part of the section. That saving clause is in these words, "Provided, &amp;c." It is contended that the forfeiture of sugars sent out after the 30th of <i>June</i> 1802, and refined before that period, is preserved by this proviso.</p>
<p>But this construction is deemed totally and clearly inadmissible. The forfeiture of the thing is not the recovery and receipt of a duty, but a punishment for the non-payment of it, and is never to be protected by a proviso extending only to remedies given for the recovery of the duty itself. To render this point still more clear, the proviso in express terms comprises fines, penalties and forfeitures incurred before the 30th of <i>June.</i> It is impossible to suppose they would not have deemed it equally necessary, to provide expressly for the preservation of those which might afterwards be incurred, if it was contemplated that the state of things introduced by the act admitted of such subsequent forfeitures.</p>
<p>The force of this argument therefore remains undiminished.</p>
<p>It has very properly been observed at the bar, that it was most apparently the object of the legislature through their whole system of imposts, duties and excises <span class="star-pagination">*62</span> to tax expense and not industry, and that, in the particular case of the duty now in question, this intent is manifested with peculiar plainness. The refiner of sugars never hazards the payment of the duty himself, because he is never to pay it until they are presumed to be sold, by being sent out of the building in which they have been refined. In most other cases it has been deemed sufficient to secure this object by a credit, which will allow time for the sale of the article, after which the duty must be paid whether the article be sold or not. But in the case of refined sugars, the refiner never can be liable for the duty, but on a fact which is considered, and properly considered, as evidencing a sale, after which a credit for the collection of the duty is still allowed him. With respect to the refiner of sugars, then, it must, on an inspection of the act, emphatically be said, that the legislature designed him to collect the duty from the consumer, but never to pay it from the manufacture; that the tax should infallibly be imposed on expense, and never on labour. If this proposition be true it furnishes an additional argument in favour of that construction which is believed to be correct.</p>
<p>If the duty is payable on sugars refined before the 30th of <i>June</i> 1802, whenever they may be sent out, that duty will fall on the refiner himself, because sugars refined before the 30th of <i>June,</i> must come into the market at the same price with those refined afterwards and cannot sell, in consideration of the duty with which they are burthened, at a higher price than sugars admitted not to be chargeable with that duty. So far as this effect would be produced by the repealing law, it would occasion an oppression which the enacting law has manifested a particular solicitude to avoid.</p>
<p>This effect, it is said, is produced in the case of those distilled spirits which are subjected to a duty on the quantity distilled or removed, and therefore the refiner of sugars ought to be considered as receiving the same measure.</p>
<p>But it has already been shown that a difference is made in the first creation of the tax between the distiller and the refiner; and the same difference may be perceived throughout. But if they were viewed with <span class="star-pagination">*63</span> precisely the same degree of favor, yet there is a difference between relinquishing a right which was complete, when the law under which it accrued ceased to operate, and one depending on a fact afterwards to happen.</p>
<p>The argument which controverts the proposition, that the legislature designed in no instance to subject the refiner of sugars to the tax on the article till a sale should take place, is founded on the circumstance, that the refiner may be himself a retailer, and may remove his sugars from the building to his retail store, and thus become liable for the tax before the sale.</p>
<p>But the fallacy of this argument is immediately detected. A person acting in two distinct characters must in many respects be considered as two distinct persons. The refiner who is in a different place the retailer of sugars, must be considered as selling them from the manufactory, when he sends them out of it to his retail store. The law contemplates the fact exactly in the same manner, and must give to it the same effect as if they had been sent to the retail store of a different person and considers them as sold.</p>
<p>It has also been contended, that the proviso in the act would be unnecessary, and absolutely inoperative, unless it be construed to apply to the duties on the sugars remaining in the building on the 30th of <i>June.</i> Those duties which were bonded, cannot, it is said, be the object of the proviso, because they, in contemplation of law, are not outstanding: they are paid by the bond given by the debtor, and there remains only the duty on sugars not sent out, which is outstanding, and is to be preserved by this part of the act.</p>
<p>It requires but a very slight attention to the subject, to perceive that this argument is not entitled to the weight which has been attributed to it.</p>
<p>The act imposing the duty, does in terms speak of its being bonded in contradistinction to its being paid. The duty is either to be paid, or secured by bond. To say then, that a duty secured by bond was not outstanding in contemplation of the legislature, but was paid, would be to violate the very words of the act.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*64</span> In addition to this circumstance, it ought to be observed, that the repeal takes effect at the close of the 30th of <i>June,</i> and the law has no existence on the 1st of <i>July.</i> Yet the duties on sugars sent out during the last quarter are to be secured or paid on the 1st of <i>July.</i> All admit that there was no disposition to relinquish these duties. Of consequence, if the proviso could be necessary in any possible construction of the law, it was necessary in this case.</p>
<p>After the most attentive consideration of the acts of Congress and the arguments of counsel, the court is of opinion, that the duties on refined sugars remaining in the building on the 1st of <i>July,</i> 1802, had not then accrued and were not then outstanding. The judgment of the circuit court, which was in favour of the plaintiff below, must therefore be reversed, and judgment rendered for the plaintiff in error.</p>

<center>February 22, 1804.</center>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*36</span> <i>Ingersoll,</i> for plaintiff in error.</p>
<p><i>Lincoln, attorney-general of the U.S. and Dallas for defendant in error.</i></p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*51</span> MARSHALL, Chief Justice, delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
<p>In this case a single point is presented to the court. The plaintiff in error was a refiner of sugar, in the city of Philadelphia, and had a large quantity of refined sugars in his refinery, on the 1st of July, 1802.</p>
<p>In April, 1802, Congress passed an act to repeal the internal taxes. The first section of the repealing law enacts "that from and after the 30th day of June next, the internal duties," &amp;c.</p>
<p>To recover the duty on sugars refined <i>before</i> the 30th of June, and sent out <i>afterwards,</i> this action was brought. The single question is, Whether the duty had then accrued, and was on that day outstanding? This is admitted on both sides; and the repealing law is to be construed, as if it had passed on the 30th of June, to take effect immediately, and the proviso had been expressed in words of the present tense, thus, "provided, that for the recovery and receipt of such duties as have now accrued, and now remain outstanding, the provisions of the aforesaid act shall remain in full force and virtue."</p>
<p>Had the duty accrued, and was it outstanding in contemplation of the legislature, on sugars refined, but not sent out of the building in which the operation was performed?</p>
<p>The solution of this question depends on the construction of the act by which the duty was imposed.</p>
<p>This act passed in June 1794, and is entitled "an act laying certain duties on snuff and refined sugars." The first section imposes a duty on snuff, which shall be manufactured after the 30th of September then next ensuing, and the second section is in these words, "And be it further enacted, that from and after the said 30th day of September next, there be <i>levied, collected</i> <span class="star-pagination">*52</span> <i>and paid</i> upon all sugar which shall be refined within the United States, a duty of two cents per pound.</p>
<p>The fourth section of the act contains provisions respecting the duty on snuff, and the fifth section, after making several regulations requiring the refiner of sugars to report the building and utensils to be employed in the manufacture, and to give bond with condition that he shall keep books in which he shall enter daily the sugars refined, as well as those sent out, proceeds to enact, "that he shall on the 1st day of <i>January, April, July,</i> and <i>October,</i> in each year, render a just and true account of all the refined sugar, which he or she shall have sent out, or caused, or procured to be sent out, from the first time of his or her entry and report aforesaid, until the day which shall first ensue, of the days above mentioned, for the rendering of such account, and thenceforth successively, from the time when such account ought to have been, and up to which it shall have been last rendered, until the day next thereafter, of the days above mentioned, for the rendering of such account, producing and showing therewith the original book or paper, whereon the entries, from day to day, to be made as aforesaid, have been made: and he or she shall, at the time of rendering each account, pay or secure the duties, which by this act ought to be paid upon the refined sugar in the said account mentioned."</p>
<p>Other sections of this act have been relied on by the counsel on both sides, and the phraseology of the law, in other acts said to be <i>in pari materia</i> has been brought into view. They have not been unnoticed by the court in forming the opinion now to be delivered; but as the case depends principally on the just construction of the sections which have been quoted, those sections only are stated for the present.</p>
<p>That a law is the best expositor of itself, that every part of an act is to be taken into view, for the purpose of discovering, the mind of the legislature; and that the details of one part may contain regulations restricting the extent of general expressions used in another part of the same act, are among those plain rules laid down by common sense for the exposition of statutes <span class="star-pagination">*53</span> which have been uniformly acknowledged. If by the application of these rules it shall appear, that the duty on refined sugars did "accrue, and was outstanding" before the article was sent out of the building, then the refiner is unquestionably liable to pay it, notwithstanding the repeal of the law by which it was imposed.</p>
<p>To support the proposition, that the duty did accrue, the words of the second section of the act for imposing it, have been relied on. These words are, "that from and after the 30th day of September next, there be <i>levied, collected and paid</i> upon all sugar which shall be refined within the United states, a duty of two cents per pound." These words, it is said, contain an express charge upon all the sugars to be refined within the United States.</p>
<p>It is admitted by the counsel for the plaintiff in error, that such would be the operation of the section if unexplained, and not restrained by other parts of the law.</p>
<p>In order to determine the influence which other sections must necessarily have on this, it is proper to ascertain with precision the import of the words which have been stated.</p>
<p>"There shall be <i>levied, collected and paid,</i>" &amp;c. Each of these words implies a charge upon the article, and if either of them had been used singly, no doubt could have been entertained that the article would have been burthened with the tax. They present to the mind distinct ideas, and when used together seem to designate distinct actions required by the law.</p>
<p>It would not, perhaps, be assuming more than is warranted to say, that either of them exclusively imports the creation and imposition of the duty. The word <i>levy</i> is selected for this purpose; and yet, in the succeeding section, the term is again used with a reference to that now under consideration, and very plainly designates the duty of the officer, not the operation of the act. The words of the third section are, "that the duties aforesaid shall be levied, collected and accounted for by the same officers," &amp;c. The meaning <span class="star-pagination">*54</span> of the term in this section is by no means equivocal, and there does not appear sufficient ground for saying, that it was used by the legislature in the preceding section in a different sense. Unquestionably the requisition that a duty shall be levied, collected or paid, implies the existence of that duty: it seems to be as clearly implied by the one term as by the other. But, however, this may be, they act on the same subject and at the same time. The object of each verb is precisely the same. "There shall be levied" Â— on what? On "all sugars to be refined within the United States." There shall be "collected and paid" Â— from and on what? "all sugars to be refined within the United States." It has then been very correctly said, that these words, though not synonimous, are certainly as they stand in the sentence, co-extensive in their operation. They reach and embrace the same article at the same time. If then the other parts of the act demonstrate, that the words collected and paid, have not for their object all sugars to be refined, this section is necessarily restrained in its operation by those which follow and designate more particularly what is in the first instance expressed in general terms.</p>
<p>That such is the real effect of the law is acknowledged. It is admitted by the counsel for the defendant in error, that the duties are not to be collected and paid on all sugars to be refined, but on all sugars to be refined <i>and sent out</i> of the building. It follows then, that the general terms of the second section were intended by the legislature to be understood, in like manner, as if their intent had been expressly qualified, by adding the words "according to the regulations herein after prescribed;" or other words of similar import.</p>
<p>But admitting this view of the case to be correct, the great difficulty remains to be solved. It is contended by the defendant in error, that the fifth section neither imposes a duty, nor restrains to a more limited object the duty which was before imposed, and that its only effect is to prescribe the time of <i>payment</i> Â— that the duty on the article, taking the two sections together, constitutes a <i>present debt to be paid in future.</i></p>
<p>On the other hand the plaintiff in error insists that <span class="star-pagination">*55</span> the general terms of the second section, are defined and restricted by the fifth, as well with respect to the object of the tax, as to the <i>time of its collection and payment.</i></p>
<p>The court has felt great difficulty on this point. It is one on which the most correct minds may form opposite opinions, without exciting surprise. After the most attentive examination of the laws and the arguments of counsel, a judgment has at length been formed, differing from that rendered in the circuit court.</p>
<p>The object of the act imposing the duty being revenue, and not to discourage manufactures, it is reasonable to suppose that the attention of the legislature would be devoted to the article in that state in which it was designed to be productive of revenue. There could be no motive for imposing a duty never to be collected, or for imposing it on the article in that condition, in which it might remain forever, without yielding a cent to the treasury. The duty not being progressive, but complete in the instant of its commencement, being one entire thing, no purpose was to be effected by charging it on an object, from which it was not afterwards to be drawn.</p>
<p>If therefore, we find the whole attention of the legislature directed to the article in one state, if we find it productive only in one state, there is no reason for supposing, unless the words require that construction, that the duty was imposed upon it in a different state.</p>
<p>All those provisions of the act, which are calculated to bring the money arising from this tax, into the treasury, or to create any liability in the person who is to pay it, apply exclusively to sugars sent out of the building.</p>
<p>Of those sugars only is an account to be rendered; on those only are the duties to be paid or secured. It can scarcely be imagined that the legislature, if imposing a duty on all sugars refined, should entirely neglect to take any means whatever, to secure the collection of that duty, and should postpone those means until a subsequent event should happen, which might never occur.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*56</span> It is argued by the counsel for the defendant in error, that the happening of this event was certain, and that it was unnecessary for the legislature to perform any act which might occasion it, because the interest of the refiner, was a sure pledge for his sending out the sugars he had refined.</p>
<p>This is true, but the argument is not less strong when urged to prove, that the legislature might rely on this interest to produce the state of things, which would create the charge. If this interest was relied upon, for the fact on which a duty should become payable, it might well be relied upon to produce the fact on which the article should be chargeable with the duty; and it is unquestionably in the common course of legislative proceedings on the subject of revenue, to obtain security for the payment of duties, at the first convenient time after they shall have accrued.</p>
<p>If, as is contended for the defendant in error, the act of refining the sugar, creates a debt to be paid when sent out of the building, then the refiner becomes immediately the debtor of the government, and his situation by sending out the sugar, is changed in no other respect whatever, than that the debt before created does by that fact become payable. The position to be proved is that A, the refiner of sugars, becomes the debtor of the United States, to the full amount of the sugars refined, which debt does not accrue but only becomes payable on the fact of their being sent out of the building.</p>
<p>Let this proposition be examined.</p>
<p>If A becomes the debtor by the mere act of refining, then he remains the debtor until he shall be legally discharged. Suppose him to part with his manufactory and his capital stock, there being at the time of transfer a quantity of refined sugars in the building, which pass with it to the purchaser. If, by the act of refining, A became the debtor of the government, which debt became payable whenever the sugars should be sent out of the building, then A would remain the debtor-notwithstanding his sale, and would be liable for <span class="star-pagination">*57</span> those duties, if the purchaser should send them out without rendering any account of them, or securing their payment.</p>
<p>Yet this construction would be admitted to conflict with the obvious meaning of the law. Not only the person who sends out the sugars, is to account and pay for them, but if he fails to do so, the consequences of his failure fall entirely on himself. The sugar is forfeited, and if lost to the purchaser, his recourse could only be against the person from whom he purchased.</p>
<p>But let it be supposed, that A sends out his sugars and parts with his building, before the day on which the account is to be rendered, and the duties paid or secured. Who then would be the debtor of the government? Who in that case would be liable for the duties that had thus accrued? It is believed that only one answer could be given to this question. The person who sent out the sugars, would unquestionably be liable for the duties on them, and if they should be seized for the non-payment of them, the purchaser would have recourse to him for compensation.</p>
<p>If these positions be correct, it would seem to be a plain and necessary deduction from them, that the fact of sending out the sugars, not the fact of refining them, created the debt, and that the person sending them out became the debtor.</p>
<p>It has been argued that the provision of the 5th section, which requires a daily entry to be made on the books, of the quantity of sugars refined, evidences an intention in the legislature, to impose a tax on the article immediately. But this argument did not appear to be much relied on, and it is too apparent that the regulations of the 5th section were designed to furnish the means of detecting any fraud which might be attempted, in the account of sugars sent out of the building, to require that the court should employ any time in demonstrating the correctness of that construction.</p>
<p>The argument drawn from the 3d section, which uses the expression "the duties aforesaid," does not <span class="star-pagination">*58</span> appear to operate more in favour of the construction contended for by the counsel for the defendant in error. The section is employed not in designating the tax to be collected, but the person to collect it, and the words have the same import, as if instead of "the duties aforesaid," the language had been changed and the words, "the duties imposed by this act" had been used.</p>
<p>The sections respecting drawbacks have been relied on by both plaintiff and defendant, as completely supporting his own construction of the act, but the court can perceive nothing in those sections in any degree affecting the case.</p>
<p>It has been stated by both parties, that all the revenue acts of the United States, may be considered as <i>in pari materia,</i> as forming one connected system, and therefore to be compared together, when any one of them is to be construed.</p>
<p>In pursuance of this doctrine they have been resorted to by the defendant in error, to show that the terms used in the 2d section of the act under consideration are such as in all those acts import the imposition of a duty.</p>
<p>This is not questioned. It is not denied that a tax is imposed, nor would this have been denied if two of the three words used in the act had been omitted. It is the general phraseology of laws enacted for the purpose of raising money, but to reason by way of analogy, from the acts quoted to that under consideration, it would be necessary to show, that these general terms had been construed to be more extensive than the particular regulations, which follow for the purpose of carrying them into execution. It is not recollected that this has been attempted.</p>
<p>It has been argued that the duty on spirits of the home manufactory, is laid on their distillation, not on their removal, and that the legislature must therefore be presumed also, to have imposed the duty on sugars, on the act of refining them, and not on the act of removal.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*59</span> But the force of this argument is not admitted. Those political motives which induce the legislature to select objects of revenue and to tax them under particular circumstances, are not for judicial consideration. Where the legislature distinguishes between different objects, and in imposing a duty on them evidences a will to charge them in different situations, it is not for the courts to beat down these distinctions on the allegation that they are capriciously made, and therefore to be disregarded. It is the duty of the court to discover the intention of the legislature, and to respect that intention. Where the provisions of two acts are so unlike each other, that the comparison exhibits only a contrast, instead of saying that their opposing regulations were designed to be similar, it would seem much more reasonable to say that the one act exhibits a legislative mind materially variant in the particulars where the difference exists from what is exhibited by the other.</p>
<p>Every regulation of the act imposing a duty on spirits distilled within the United States, respects exclusively the time of distillation, and they are all essentially variant from the regulations of the act imposing a duty on snuff and refined sugars.</p>
<p>The duty on spirits is to be paid or secured previous to their removal. That on sugars is not to be paid or secured until after their removal.</p>
<p>The credit for the duties on distilled spirits is allowed from the date of a bond, to be quarter annually given for all the spirits distilled whether removed or not, so that the credit is as near as possible from the date of distillation.</p>
<p>The credit for the duties on refined sugars is allowed from the date of a bond quarter annually given for all the sugars removed from the building, so that the credit is as near as possible from the date of the removal.</p>
<p>Spirits having a duty imposed on them at the time of distillation are liable to seizure and confiscation if removed without paying or securing the duty.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*60</span> Sugars not being liable for the duty till removed are not seizable nor confiscable unless the refiner, after removal, shall have failed to pay or secure the duties which became payable at a given day after their removal.</p>
<p>With respect to country stills, the tax is laid on the capacity of the still, and is to be paid without regard to the quantity distilled, but if this tax should become oppressive it may be discharged by paying the duty on the quantity actually distilled. In this case no respect whatever is paid to the removal of the spirits. Their distillation alone attracts the attention of the legislature.</p>
<p>With respect to all refined sugars no duty can ever be demanded, unless the demand be predicated on the fact of removal.</p>
<p>Spirits being chargeable with the duty when distilled cannot be removed without a permit.</p>
<p>Sugars being only chargeable when sent out may be removed at the will of the refiner.</p>
<p>It is going very far indeed to argue a sameness of intention from these dissimilar regulations. The court thinks it much more correct to say that the intention of the legislature with respect to these different objects was entirely different, and that in the case of spirits the duty was imposed on the distillation, while in the case of sugars the duty was imposed on the removal.</p>
<p>It is not improbable that the difference in the progress made in the two pursuits, and the greater degree of forbearance required by the one than by the other; or that the difference in the facility with which frauds might be practised in the two cases, might occasion this apparent difference in the time of imposing the duty on the article. But this, it is repeated, is a legislative not a judicial inquiry and, if the difference exists, it must be respected, whatever may be the motives which produced it.</p>
<p>Some arguments have been drawn from the repealing law which have too much weight to be unnoticed.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*61</span> It has been said that the provisions intended as a guard, to prevent frauds in the collection of duties on sugars sent out of the building, are dispensed with so far as respects sugars refined before the 30th of <i>June,</i> but sent out after that day, and from thence it is argued that the legislature could not have supposed sugars under such circumstances to be liable to a duty. The weight of this argument if supported by the fact, is so apparent that the counsel for the defendant in error, controverts the fact itself, and not the inference drawn from that fact, if it be correctly stated.</p>
<p>It is and must be admitted, that the first part of the first section of the repealing law does away any forfeiture which was to be produced by the future operation of the act repealed. If therefore such forfeiture is retained, it must be by virtue of the saving in the subsequent part of the section. That saving clause is in these words, "Provided, &amp;c." It is contended that the forfeiture of sugars sent out after the 30th of <i>June</i> 1802, and refined before that period, is preserved by this proviso.</p>
<p>But this construction is deemed totally and clearly inadmissible. The forfeiture of the thing is not the recovery and receipt of a duty, but a punishment for the non-payment of it, and is never to be protected by a proviso extending only to remedies given for the recovery of the duty itself. To render this point still more clear, the proviso in express terms comprises fines, penalties and forfeitures incurred before the 30th of <i>June.</i> It is impossible to suppose they would not have deemed it equally necessary, to provide expressly for the preservation of those which might afterwards be incurred, if it was contemplated that the state of things introduced by the act admitted of such subsequent forfeitures.</p>
<p>The force of this argument therefore remains undiminished.</p>
<p>It has very properly been observed at the bar, that it was most apparently the object of the legislature through their whole system of imposts, duties and excises <span class="star-pagination">*62</span> to tax expense and not industry, and that, in the particular case of the duty now in question, this intent is manifested with peculiar plainness. The refiner of sugars never hazards the payment of the duty himself, because he is never to pay it until they are presumed to be sold, by being sent out of the building in which they have been refined. In most other cases it has been deemed sufficient to secure this object by a credit, which will allow time for the sale of the article, after which the duty must be paid whether the article be sold or not. But in the case of refined sugars, the refiner never can be liable for the duty, but on a fact which is considered, and properly considered, as evidencing a sale, after which a credit for the collection of the duty is still allowed him. With respect to the refiner of sugars, then, it must, on an inspection of the act, emphatically be said, that the legislature designed him to collect the duty from the consumer, but never to pay it from the manufacture; that the tax should infallibly be imposed on expense, and never on labour. If this proposition be true it furnishes an additional argument in favour of that construction which is believed to be correct.</p>
<p>If the duty is payable on sugars refined before the 30th of <i>June</i> 1802, whenever they may be sent out, that duty will fall on the refiner himself, because sugars refined before the 30th of <i>June,</i> must come into the market at the same price with those refined afterwards and cannot sell, in consideration of the duty with which they are burthened, at a higher price than sugars admitted not to be chargeable with that duty. So far as this effect would be produced by the repealing law, it would occasion an oppression which the enacting law has manifested a particular solicitude to avoid.</p>
<p>This effect, it is said, is produced in the case of those distilled spirits which are subjected to a duty on the quantity distilled or removed, and therefore the refiner of sugars ought to be considered as receiving the same measure.</p>
<p>But it has already been shown that a difference is made in the first creation of the tax between the distiller and the refiner; and the same difference may be perceived throughout. But if they were viewed with <span class="star-pagination">*63</span> precisely the same degree of favor, yet there is a difference between relinquishing a right which was complete, when the law under which it accrued ceased to operate, and one depending on a fact afterwards to happen.</p>
<p>The argument which controverts the proposition, that the legislature designed in no instance to subject the refiner of sugars to the tax on the article till a sale should take place, is founded on the circumstance, that the refiner may be himself a retailer, and may remove his sugars from the building to his retail store, and thus become liable for the tax before the sale.</p>
<p>But the fallacy of this argument is immediately detected. A person acting in two distinct characters must in many respects be considered as two distinct persons. The refiner who is in a different place the retailer of sugars, must be considered as selling them from the manufactory, when he sends them out of it to his retail store. The law contemplates the fact exactly in the same manner, and must give to it the same effect as if they had been sent to the retail store of a different person and considers them as sold.</p>
<p>It has also been contended, that the proviso in the act would be unnecessary, and absolutely inoperative, unless it be construed to apply to the duties on the sugars remaining in the building on the 30th of <i>June.</i> Those duties which were bonded, cannot, it is said, be the object of the proviso, because they, in contemplation of law, are not outstanding: they are paid by the bond given by the debtor, and there remains only the duty on sugars not sent out, which is outstanding, and is to be preserved by this part of the act.</p>
<p>It requires but a very slight attention to the subject, to perceive that this argument is not entitled to the weight which has been attributed to it.</p>
<p>The act imposing the duty, does in terms speak of its being bonded in contradistinction to its being paid. The duty is either to be paid, or secured by bond. To say then, that a duty secured by bond was not outstanding in contemplation of the legislature, but was paid, would be to violate the very words of the act.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*64</span> In addition to this circumstance, it ought to be observed, that the repeal takes effect at the close of the 30th of <i>June,</i> and the law has no existence on the 1st of <i>July.</i> Yet the duties on sugars sent out during the last quarter are to be secured or paid on the 1st of <i>July.</i> All admit that there was no disposition to relinquish these duties. Of consequence, if the proviso could be necessary in any possible construction of the law, it was necessary in this case.</p>
<p>After the most attentive consideration of the acts of Congress and the arguments of counsel, the court is of opinion, that the duties on refined sugars remaining in the building on the 1st of <i>July,</i> 1802, had not then accrued and were not then outstanding. The judgment of the circuit court, which was in favour of the plaintiff below, must therefore be reversed, and judgment rendered for the plaintiff in error.</p>

<center><h1>ALEXANDER MURRAY, Esq.<br/>
v.<br/>
SCHOONER CHARMING BETSY.</h1></center>
<center><p><b>Supreme Court of United States.</b></p></center>
<center>February 22, 1804.</center>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*70</span> The cause was argued at last term, by <i>Martin, Key,</i> and <i>Mason</i> for the claimant.</p>
<p>No counsel was present for the libellant.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*115</span> <i>Marshall,</i> Chief Justice, delivered the opinion of the court: Â—</p>
<p>The <i>Charming Betsy</i> was an <i>American</i> built vessel, belonging to citizens of the <i>United States,</i> and sailed from <i>Baltimore,</i> under the name of the <i>Jane,</i> on the 10th of <i>April,</i> 1800, with a cargo of flour for <i>St. Bartholomew's;</i> she was sent out for the purpose of being sold. The cargo was disposed of at <i>St. Bartholomew's;</i> but finding it impossible to sell the vessel at that place, the captain proceeded with her to the island of <i>St. Thomas,</i> where she was disposed of to <i>Jared Shattuck,</i> who changed her name to that of the <i>Charming Betsy,</i> and <span class="star-pagination">*116</span> having put on board her a cargo consisting of <i>American</i> produce, cleared her out as a <i>Danish</i> vessel for the island of <i>Guadaloupe.</i></p>
<p>On her voyage she was captured by a <i>French</i> privateer, and eight hands were put on board her for the purpose of taking her into <i>Guadaloupe</i> as a prize. She was afterwards recaptured by captain <i>Murray,</i> commander of the <i>Constellation</i> frigate, and carried into <i>Martinique.</i> It appears that the captain of the <i>Charming Betsy</i> was not willing to be taken into that island; but when there, he claimed to have his vessel and cargo restored, as being the property of <i>Jared Shattuck,</i> a <i>Danish</i> burgher.</p>
<p><i>Jared Shattuck</i> was born in the <i>United States,</i> but had removed to the island of <i>St. Thomas</i> while an infant, and was proved to have resided there ever since the year 1789 or 1790. He had been accustomed to carry on trade as a <i>Danish</i> subject, had married a wife and acquired real property in the island, and also taken the oath of allegiance to the crown of <i>Denmark</i> in 1797.</p>
<p>Considering him as an <i>American</i> citizen who was violating the law prohibiting all intercourse between the <i>United States</i> and <i>France</i> or its dependencies, or the sale of the vessel as a mere cover to evade that law, captain <i>Murray</i> sold the cargo of the <i>Charming Betsy,</i> which consisted of <i>American</i> produce, in <i>Martinique,</i> and brought the vessel into the port of <i>Philadelphia,</i> where she was libelled under what is termed the non-intercourse law. The vessel and cargo were claimed by the consul of <i>Denmark</i> as being the <i>bona fide</i> property of a <i>Danish</i> subject.</p>
<p>This cause came on to be heard before the judge for the district of <i>Pennsylvania,</i> who declared the seizure to be illegal, and that the vessel ought to be restored and the proceeds of the cargo paid to the claimant or his lawful agent, together with costs and such damages as should be assessed by the clerk of the court, who was directed to inquire into and report the amount thereof; for which purpose he was also directed to associate with himself two intelligent merchants of the district, and duly inquire what damage <i>Jared Shattuck</i> had sustained by reason of the premises. If they should be of opinion that the <span class="star-pagination">*117</span> officers of the <i>Constellation</i> had conferred any benefit on the owner of the <i>Charming Betsy</i> by rescuing her out of the hands of the <i>French</i> captors, they were in the adjustment to allow reasonable compensation for the service.</p>
<p>In pursuance of this order the clerk associated with himself two merchants, and reported, that having examined the proofs and vouchers exhibited in the cause, they were of opinion that the owner of the vessel and cargo had sustained damage to the amount of 20,594 dollars and 16 cents, from which is to be deducted the sum of 4,363 dollars and 86 cents, the amount of monies paid into court arising from the sales of the cargo, and the further sum of 1,300 dollars, being the residue of the proceeds of the said sales remaining to be brought into court, 5,663 dollars and 86 cents. This estimate is exclusive of the value of the vessel, which was fixed at 3,000 dollars.</p>
<p>To this report an account is annexed, in which the damages, without particularizing the items on which the estimate was formed, were stated at 14,930 dollars and 30 cents.</p>
<p>No exceptions having been taken to this report, it was confirmed, and by the final sentence of the court captain <i>Murray</i> was ordered to pay the amount thereof.</p>
<p>From this decree an appeal was prayed to the circuit court, where the decree was affirmed so far as it directed restitution of the vessel and payment to the claimant of the net proceeds of the sale of the cargo in <i>Martinique,</i> and reversed for the residue.</p>
<p>From this decree each party has appealed to this court.</p>
<p>It is contended on the part of the captors in substance,</p>
<p>1st. That the vessel <i>Charming Betsy</i> and cargo are confiscable under the laws of the <i>United States.</i> If not so,</p>
<p>2d. That the captors are entitled to salvage. If this is against them,</p>
<p>3d. That they ought to be excused from damages, <span class="star-pagination">*118</span> because there was probable cause for seizing the vessel and bringing her into port.</p>
<p>1st. Is the <i>Charming Betsy</i> subject to seizure and condemnation for having violated a law of the <i>United States?</i></p>
<p>The libel claims this forfeiture under the act passed in <i>February,</i> 1800, further to suspend the commercial intercourse between the <i>United States</i> and <i>France</i> and the dependencies thereof.</p>
<p>That act declares "that all commercial intercourse," &amp;c. It has been very properly observed, in argument, that the building of vessels in the <i>United States</i> for sale to neutrals, in the islands, is, during war, a profitable business, which Congress cannot be intended to have prohibited, unless that intent be manifested by express words or a very plain and necessary implication.</p>
<p>It has also been observed that an act of Congress ought never to be construed to violate the law of nations if any other possible construction remains, and consequently can never be construed to violate neutral rights, or to affect neutral commerce, further than is warranted by the law of nations as understood in this country.</p>
<p>These principles are believed to be correct, and they ought to be kept in view in construing the act now under consideration.</p>
<p>The first sentence of the act which describes the persons whose commercial intercourse with <i>France</i> or her dependencies is to be prohibited, names any person or persons, resident within the <i>United States</i> or under their protection. Commerce carried on by persons within this description is declared to be illicit.</p>
<p>From persons the act proceeds to things, and declares explicitly the cases in which the vessels employed in this illicit commerce shall be forfeited. Any vessel owned, hired or employed wholly or in part by any person residing within the <i>United States,</i> or by any citizen thereof residing elsewhere, which shall perform certain <span class="star-pagination">*119</span> acts recited in the law, becomes liable to forfeiture. It seems to the court to be a correct construction of these words to say, that the vessel must be of this description, not at the time of the passage of the law, but at the time when the act of forfeiture shall be committed. The cases of forfeiture are, 1st. A vessel of the description mentioned, which shall be voluntarily carried, or shall be destined, or permitted to proceed to any port within the <i>French</i> Republic. She must, when carried, or destined, or permitted to proceed to such port, be a vessel within the description of the act.</p>
<p>The second class of cases are those where vessels shall be sold, bartered, entrusted, or transferred, for the purpose that they may proceed to such port or place. This part of the section makes the crime of the sale dependent on the purpose for which it was made. If it was intended that any American vessel sold to a neutral should, in the possession of that neutral, be liable to the commercial disabilities imposed on her while she belonged to citizens of the <i>United States,</i> such extraordinary intent ought to have been plainly expressed; and if it was designed to prohibit the sale of <i>American</i> vessels to neutrals, the words placing the forfeiture on the intent with which the sale was made ought not to have been inserted.</p>
<p>The third class of cases are those vessels which shall be employed in any traffic by or for any person resident within the territories of the <i>French</i> Republic, or any of its dependencies.</p>
<p>In these cases too the vessels must be within the description of the act at the time the fact producing the forfeiture was committed.</p>
<p>The <i>Jane</i> having been completely transferred in the island of <i>St. Thomas,</i> by a <i>bona fide</i> sale to <i>Jared Shattuck,</i> and the forfeiture alleged to have accrued on a fact subsequent to that transfer, the liability of the vessel to forfeiture must depend on the inquiry whether the purchase was within the description of the act.</p>
<p><i>Jared Shattuck</i> having been born within the <i>United</i> <span class="star-pagination">*120</span> <i>States,</i> and not being proved to have expatriated himself according to any form prescribed by law, is said to remain a citizen, entitled to the benefit and subject to the disabilities imposed upon <i>American</i> citizens; and, therefore, to come expressly within the description of the act which comprehends <i>American</i> citizens residing elsewhere.</p>
<p>Whether a person born within the <i>United States,</i> or becoming a citizen according to the established laws of the country, can divest himself absolutely of that character otherwise than in such manner as may be prescribed by law, is a question which it is not necessary at present to decide. The cases cited at bar and the arguments drawn from the general conduct of the <i>United States</i> on this interesting subject, seem completely to establish the principle that an <i>American</i> citizen may acquire in a foreign country, the commercial privileges attached to his domicil, and be exempted from the operation of an act expressed in such general terms as that now under consideration. Indeed the very expressions of the act would seem to exclude a person under the circumstances of <i>Jared Shattuck.</i> He is not a person under the protection of the <i>United States.</i> The <i>American</i> citizen who goes into a foreign country, although he owes local and temporary allegiance to that country, is yet, if he performs no other act changing his condition, entitled to the protection of our government; and if, without the violation of any municipal law, he should be oppressed unjustly, he would have a right to claim that protection, and the interposition of the <i>American</i> government in his favour, would be considered a justifiable interposition. But his situation is completely changed, where by his own act he has made himself the subject of a foreign power. Although this act may not be sufficient to rescue him from punishment for any crime committed against the <i>United States,</i> a point not intended to be decided, yet it certainly places him out of the protection of the <i>United States</i> while within the territory of the sovereign to whom he has sworn allegiance, and consequently takes him out of the description of the act.</p>
<p>It is therefore the opinion of the court, that the <span class="star-pagination">*121</span> <i>Charming Betsy,</i> with her cargo, being at the time of her recapture the <i>bona fide</i> property of a <i>Danish</i> burgher, is not forfeitable, in consequence of her being employed in carrying on trade and commerce with a <i>French</i> island.</p>
<p>The vessel not being liable to confiscation, the court is brought to the second question, which is:</p>
<p>2d. Are the recaptors entitled to salvage?</p>
<p>In the case of the <i>Amelia</i><sup>[*]</sup> it was decided, on mature consideration, that a neutral armed vessel in possession of the <i>French</i> might, in the then existing state of hostilities between the two nations, be lawfully captured; and if there were well founded reasons for the opinion that she was in imminent hazard of being condemned as a prize, the recaptors would be entitled to salvage. The court is well satisfied with the decision given in that case, and considers it as a precedent not to be departed from in other cases attended with circumstances substantially similar to those of the <i>Amelia.</i> One of these circumstances is, that the vessel should be in a condition to annoy <i>American</i> commerce.</p>
<p>The degree of arming which should bring a vessel within this description has not been ascertained, and perhaps it would be difficult precisely to mark the limits, the passing of which would bring a captured vessel within the description of the acts of Congress, on this subject. But although there may be difficulty some cases, there appears to be none in this. According to the testimony of the case, there was on board but one musket, a few ounces of powder, and a few balls. The testimony respecting the cutlasses is not considered as shewing that they were in the vessel at the time of her recapture. The capacity of this vessel for offence appears not sufficient to warrant the capture of her as an armed vessel. Neither is it proved to the satisfaction of the court, that the <i>Charming Betsy</i> was in such imminent hazard of being condemned as to entitle the recaptors to salvage.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*122</span> It remains to inquire whether there was in this case such probable cause for sending in the <i>Charming Betsy</i> for adjudication as will justify captain <i>Murray</i> for having broken up her voyage, and excuse him from the damages sustained thereby.</p>
<p>To effect this there must have been substantial reason for believing her to have been at the time wholly or in part an <i>American</i> vessel, within the description of the act, or hired, or employed by <i>Americans,</i> or sold, bartered, or trusted for the purpose of carrying on trade to some port or place belonging to the <i>French</i> Republic.</p>
<p>The circumstances relied upon are principally.</p>
<p>1st. The <i>process verbal</i> of the <i>French</i> captors.</p>
<p>2d. That she was an <i>American</i> built vessel.</p>
<p>3d. That the sale was recent.</p>
<p>4th. That the captain was a <i>Scotchman,</i> and the muster roll shewed that the crew were not <i>Danes.</i></p>
<p>5th. The general practice in the <i>Danish</i> islands of covering neutral property.</p>
<p>1st. The <i>proces verbal</i> contains an assertion that the mate declared that he was an <i>American,</i> and that their flag had been <i>American,</i> and had been changed during the cruise to <i>Danish,</i> which declaration was confirmed by several of the crew.</p>
<p>If the mate had really been an <i>American,</i> the vessel would not on that account have been liable to forfeiture, nor should that fact have furnished any conclusive testimony of the character of the vessel. The <i>proces verbal</i> however ought for several reasons to have been suspected. The general conduct of the <i>French West-India</i> cruisers and the very circumstance of declaring that the <i>Danish</i> colors were made during the chase, were sufficient to destroy the credibility of the <i>proces verbal.</i> Captain <i>Murray</i> ought not to have believed that an <i>American</i> vessel trading to a <i>French</i> port in the assumed character of a <i>Danish</i> bottom, would have been without <i>Danish</i> colors.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*123</span> That she was an <i>American</i> vessel, and that the sale was recent, cannot be admitted to furnish just cause of suspicion, unless the sale of <i>American</i> built vessels had been an illegal or an unusual act.</p>
<p>That the captain was a <i>Scotchman</i> and that the names of the crew were not generally <i>Danish,</i> are circumstances of small import, when it is recollected that a very great proportion of the inhabitants of <i>St. Thomas's</i> are <i>British</i> and <i>Americans.</i></p>
<p>The practice of covering <i>American</i> property in the islands might and would justify captain <i>Murray</i> in giving to other causes of suspicion more weight than they would otherwise be entitled to, but cannot be itself a motive for seizure. If it was, no neutral vessel could escape, for this ground of suspicion would be applicable to them all.</p>
<p>These causes of suspicion taken together ought not to have been deemed sufficient to counterbalance the evidence of fairness with which they were opposed. The ship's papers appear to have been perfectly correct, and the information of the captain uncontradicted by those belonging to the vessel who were taken with him, corroborated their verity. No circumstance existed, which ought to have discredited them. That a certified copy of <i>Shattuck's</i> oath, as a <i>Danish</i> subject, was not on board, is immaterial, because, being apparently on all the papers a burgher and it being unknown that he was born in the <i>United States,</i> the question whether he had ceased to be a citizen of the <i>United States</i> could not present itself.</p>
<p>Nor was it material that the power given by the owners of the vessel, to their captain to sell her in the <i>West-Indies,</i> was not exhibited. It certainly was not necessary to exhibit the instructions under which the vessel was acquired, when the fact of acquisition was fully proved by the documents on board and by other testimony.</p>
<p>Although there does not appear to have been such cause to suspect the <i>Chairming Betsy</i> and her cargo to have been <i>American,</i> as would justify captain <i>Murray</i> in bringing her in for adjudication, yet many other circumstances combine with the fairness of his character to produce <span class="star-pagination">*124</span> a conviction that he acted upon correct motives, from a sense of duty; for which reason this hard case ought not to be rendered still more so by a decision in any respect oppressive.</p>
<p>His orders were such as might well have induced him to consider this as an armed vessel within the law, sailing under authority from the <i>French</i> republic; and such too as might well have induced him to trust to very light suspicions respecting the real character of a vessel appearing to belong to one of the neutral islands. A public officer entrusted on the high seas to perform a duty deemed necessary by his country, and executing according to the best of his judgment the orders he has received, if he is a victim of any mistake he commits, ought certainly never to be assessed with vindictive or speculative damages. It is not only the duty of the court to relieve him from such when they plainly appear to have been imposed on him, but no sentence against him ought to be affirmed where, from the nature of the proceedings, the whole case appears upon the record, unless those proceedings are such as to shew on what the decree has been founded, and to support that decree.</p>
<p>In the case at bar damages are assessed as they would be by the verdict of the jury, without any specifications of items which can shew how the account was made up, or on what principles the sum given as damages was assessed. This mode of proceeding would not be approved of it was even probable from the testimony contained in the record that the sum reported by the commissioners of the district court was really the sum due. The district court ought not to have been satisfied with a report giving a gross sum in damages unaccompanied by any explanation, of the principles on which that sum was given. It is true captain <i>Murray</i> ought to have excepted to this report. His not having done so however does not cure an error apparent upon it, and the omission to shew how the damages which were given had accrued, so as to enable the judge to decide on the propriety of the assessment of his commissioners, is such an error.</p>
<p>Although the court would in any case disapprove of this mode of proceeding, yet in order to save the parties the costs of further prosecuting this business in the circuit <span class="star-pagination">*125</span> court, the error which has been stated might have been passed over, had it not appeared probable that the sum, for which the decree of the district court was rendered, is really greater than it ought to have been according to the principles by which the claim should be adjusted.</p>
<p>This court is not therefore satisfied with either the decree of the district or circuit court, and has directed me to report the following decree:</p>
<p><i>Decree of the Court.</i></p>
<p>THIS cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record of the circuit court, and was argued by counsel; on consideration whereof, it is adjudged, ordered, and decreed, as follows, to wit: That the decree of the circuit court, so far as it affirms the decree of the district court, which directed restitution of the vessel, and payment to the claimant of the net proceeds of the sale of the cargo in Martinique, deducting the costs and charges there, according to amount exhibited by capt. <i>Murray's</i> agent, being one of the exhibits in the cause, and so far as it directs the parties to bear their own costs, be affirmed; and that the residue of the said decree, whereby the claim of the owner to damages for the seizure and detention of his vessel was rejected, be reversed.</p>
<p>And the court, proceeding to give such further decree as the circuit court ought to have given, doth further adjudge, order, and decree, that so much of the decree of the district court as adjudges the libellant to pay costs and damages, be affirmed; but that the residue thereof, by which the said damages are estimated at 20,594 dollars, 16 cents, and by which the libellant was directed to pay that sum, be reversed and annulled. And this court does further order and decree, that the cause be remanded to the circuit court, with directions to refer it to commissioners, to ascertain the damages sustained by the claimants, in consequence of the refusal of the libellant to restore the vessel and cargo at Martinique, and in consequence of his sending her into a port of the <i>United States</i> for adjudication; and that the said commissioners be instructed to take the actual prime cost of the cargo and vessel, with interest thereon, including <span class="star-pagination">*126</span> the insurance actually paid, and such expenses as were necessarily sustained in consequence of bringing the vessel into the <i>United States,</i> as the standard by which the damages ought to be measured. Each party to pay his own costs in this court and in the circuit court. Â— All which is ordered and decreed accordingly.</p>
                         A true copy.
                                    E.B. CALDWELL, <i>Clerk
                                      Sup. Court U. States.</i>
<p>Captain <i>Murray</i> was reimbursed his damages, interest and charges, out of the Treasury of the <i>United States,</i> by an act of Congress, <i>January</i> 31st, 1805.</p>

<center><h1>HEAD &amp; AMORY<br/>
v.<br/>
THE PROVIDENCE INSURANCE COMPANY.</h1></center>
<center><p><b>Supreme Court of United States.</b></p></center>
<center>February 25, 1804.</center>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*136</span> The case was now argued by <i>J.Q. Adams,</i> of <i>Massachusetts,</i> and <i>Mason</i> attorney for the district of <i>Columbia,</i> on behalf of the <i>plaintiffs in error;</i> and by <i>Hunter,</i> of <i>Rhode-Island,</i> and <i>Martin,</i> attorney-general, of <i>Maryland,</i> for the <i>defendants.</i></p>
<p><i>Adams, for the plaintiffs in error.</i></p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*163</span> MARSHALL, Ch. J. delivered the opinion of the court.</p>
<p>This is a declaration on a policy of insurance, and the only question in the case is, whether the policy was vacated by a subsequent agreement between the parties. This question depends entirely on the legal operation of certain written communications between them, which appear in the record.</p>
<p>Messrs. <i>Head &amp; Amory of Boston</i> had obtained insurance through their correspondents, Messrs. <i>Brown &amp; Ives</i> of <i>Providence,</i> on the cargo of the <i>Spanish</i> brig the <i>Nueva Empressa,</i> at and from <i>Malaga</i> to <i>Vera Cruz,</i> and at and from thence to her port of discharge in <i>Spain.</i> An insurance was afterwards obtained on the brig, at and from <i>Cuba,</i> (she having been chased into the <i>Havanna</i> by <i>British</i> cruisers,) to her port of delivery in <i>Spain.</i></p>
<p>The vessel having been detained in port, closely watched by cruisers till she was worm eaten, <i>Head &amp; Amory</i> became desirous of terminating their risk at the <i>Havanna,</i> <span class="star-pagination">*164</span> which could only be effected by permission of the government at that place, which was not to be obtained but with considerable expense. They therefore applied to the insurance company, through their correspondents, <i>Brown &amp; Ives,</i> by a letter dated <i>Boston,</i> the 21st <i>August,</i> 1800, to know whether a conditional permission could be obtained from the underwriters, to terminate the voyage at the <i>Havanna,</i> provided the consent of the government could be obtained; and if so, on what terms that conditional permission would be granted.</p>
<p>The underwriters refused to make any conditional agreement, but offered to vacate both policies on terms mentioned in a letter signed by their president. Misunderstanding the letter as a proposition for vacating the policy on the cargo only, the terms proposed were acceded to, and a letter was written from <i>Head &amp; Amory</i> to <i>Brown &amp; Ives,</i> declaring their acceptance of the proposition, understood to be made by the insurance company, in such a manner as very clearly to shew the mistake under which it was written. On seeing this letter the inisapprehension of the parties was discovered and explained, and the agreement considered as not being made; at the same time a new proposition was made for settling both policies. To this letter declining absolutely any agreement respecting either policy singly, and proposing specific terms on which they would settle both, <i>Head &amp; Amory</i> returned an answer dated the 3d of <i>September</i> 1800, which was addressed to <i>Brown &amp; Ives,</i> and is in these words. Â— (<i>See ante p.</i> 131.)</p>
<p>This letter was laid by <i>Brown &amp; Ives</i> before the company, and their secretary returned the following note without a signature.</p>
<p>(See the note of <i>September</i> 6th, 1800 Â— <i>ante p.</i> 132.)</p>
<p>This note was forwarded by <i>Brown &amp; Ives,</i> to Messrs. <i>Head &amp; Amory,</i> but before they received it, intelligence came to hand that the <i>Nueva Empressa</i> had sailed from the <i>Havanna,</i> and had been captured, and was condemned as a prize late in the month of <i>August. Head &amp; Amory</i> therefore insisted on their policy.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*165</span> Every thing respecting the delays in the communications, is laid out of the case, because they do not appear to the court in any manner to affect it.</p>
<p><i>Richard Jackson</i> the President of another Marine Insurance Company, was also examined and testified that in effecting insurance, or settling a policy, or making any adjustment or agreement about insurance, the assent of the parties to doing a thing was in all respects as binding on the parties, as the thing done, according to the usage and practice among underwriters.</p>
<p>Upon this testimony, the court instructed the jury that the agreement to cancel the policy for the cargo, was fully proved, and they ought to find for the defendants on that count. The jury accordingly found for the defendants, and the plaintiffs have sued out a writ of error to bring the cause into this court.</p>
<p>The opinion and instructions of the judges of the circuit court to the jury are said to be erroneous, because,</p>
<p>The communications which have been cited, do not import a contract. They were negotiations preparatory to an agreement, but not an agreement itself.</p>
<p>The letter of the 3d of <i>September,</i> certainly manifests some degree of disappointment, at finding that the agreement supposed to have been concluded, had not really been made; and also proves their opinion that the negotiation was not absolutely broken off, but was yet pending. "If we make this settlement say they, we shall make every effort by money and interest to have the adventure terminated at the <i>Havanna,</i> and the sooner we know the better." "The terms we acceded to were very favourable to the company, as it was paying them at the rate of 35 per cent for the outward premium."</p>
<p>Yet the letter contains no direction to make any specific proposition to the company, and may be construed either as a mere inquiry, whether the company would cancel the policy for the insurance on the cargo singly, on the terms which had before been understood to have been offered, or as a new and positive proposition, the acceptance of which would complete the contract.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*166</span> It is also very questionable, whether the unsigned note delivered by the secretary is such an acceptance as to form, when taken with the letter of the 3d of <i>September,</i> an absolute agreement obligatory on the company.</p>
<p>It is a general rule that a corporation can only act in the manner prescribed by law. When its agents do not clothe their proceedings with those solemnities which are required by the incorporating act, to enable them to bind the company, the informality of the transaction as has been very properly urged at the bar, is itself conducive to the opinion, that such act was rather considered as manifesting the terms on which they were willing to bind the company, as negotiations preparatory to a conclusive agreement, than as a contract obligatory on both parties.</p>
<p>The communications stated in the record, lead to an event which might have been so readily completed, that it might have been, and probably was, supposed unnecessary to pass through the previous solemnities of a contract binding themselves to do that which, if really the wish of both parties, might so speedily be accomplished; so short a space of time was requisite to have the policy delivered up and cancelled, that the forms of completing a contract to cancel it might have been deemed useless. On this account, and on account of the known incapacities of a body corporate to act or speak but in the manner prescribed by law, it may well be doubted, whether communications which between individuals would really constitute an agreement, were viewed by the parties before the court in any other light, than as ascertaining the terms on which a contract might be formed.</p>
<p>This course of reasoning relative to the intent of the parties, is plainly founded on the idea that the note of the 6th of <i>September,</i> is in its legal operation a mere informal paper, which may perhaps amount to notice of an act, if such act was really performed, but which is not in itself an act of any legal obligation on the company. That if the proposition contained in the letter of the 3d of <i>September,</i> had been regularly accepted, this note might possibly have been considered as notice <span class="star-pagination">*167</span> of that acceptance, but is not in itself an acceptance. If this idea be incorrect, so is the reasoning founded on it. If it be correct, then it follows that no contract was made, because the proposition of the 3d of <i>September,</i> if it really was one, was not accepted by the company before it was withdrawn by <i>Head &amp; Amory.</i> This leads us to inquire,</p>
<p>Whether the unsigned note of the 6th of <i>September,</i> be a corporate act obligatory on the company.</p>
<p>Without ascribing to this body, which in its corporate capacity, is the mere creature of the act to which it owes its existence, all the qualities and disabilities annexed by the common law to ancient institutions of this sort, it may correctly be said to be precisely what the incorporating act has made it, to derive all its powers from that act, and to be capable of exerting its faculties only in the manner which that act authorises.</p>
<p>To this source of its being, then, we must recur to ascertain its powers, and to determine whether it can complete a contract by such communications as are in this record.</p>
<p>The act after incorporating the stockholders, by the name of the <i>Providence Insurance Company,</i> and enabling them to perform by that name, those things which are necessary for a corporate body, proceeds to define the manner in which those things are to be performed. Their manner of acting is thus defined. "Be it further enacted, that all policies of assurance and other instruments, made and signed by the president of the said company, or any other officer thereof, according to the ordinances, bye-laws and regulations of the said company, or of their board of directors shall be good and effectual in law, to bind and oblige the said company to the performance thereof, in manner as set forth in the constitution of the said company, herein after recited and ratified."</p>
<p>An instrument then to bind the company, must be signed by the president or some other officer, according to the ordinances, bye-laws and regulations of the company, or board of directors.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*168</span> A contract varying a policy, is as much an instrument as the policy itself, and therefore can only be executed in the manner prescribed by law. The force of the policy might indeed have been terminated by actually cancelling it, but a contract to cancel it is as solemn an act as a contract to make it, and to become the act of the company, must be executed according to the forms in which by law they are enabled to act.</p>
<p>The original constitution of the company, which is engrafted into the act of incorporation, does not aid the defendants. That agreement does not appear to dispense with the solemnities which the law is supposed to require. It demands the additional circumstance that a policy should be countersigned by the secretary.</p>
<p>It appears to the court, that an act not performed according to the requisites of the law, cannot be considered as the act of the company, in a case relating to the formation or dissolution of a policy.</p>
<p>If the testimony of Mr. <i>Jackson</i> is to be understood, as stating that an assent to the formation or dissolution of a policy, if manifested according to the forms required by law, is as binding as the actual performance of the act agreed to be done, it is probable that the practice he alludes to is correct. But if he means to say, that this assent may be manifested by parol, the practice cannot receive the sanction of this court. It would be to dispense with the formalities required by law for valuable purposes, and to enable these artificial bodies to act and to contract in a manner, essentially different from that prescribed for them by the legislature.</p>
<p>Nor do the cases which have been cited by the gentlemen of the bar appear to the court to apply in principle to this.</p>
<p>An individual has an original capacity to contract and bind himself in such manner as he pleases. For the general security of society, however, from frauds and perjuries, this general power is restricted, and he is disabled from making certain contracts by parol. This disabling act has received constructions which take <span class="star-pagination">*169</span> out of its operation, several cases not within the mischief, but which might very possibly be deemed within the strict letter of the law. He who acts by another acts for himself. He who authorises another to make a writing for him, makes it himself; but with these bodies which have only a legal existence, it is otherwise. The act of incorporation is to them an enabling act; it gives them all the power they possess; it enables them to contract, and when it prescribes to them a mode of contracting, they must observe that mode, or the instrument no more creates a contract than if the body had never been incorporated.</p>
<p>It is then the opinion of this court, that the circuit court erred in directing the jury that the communications contained in the record in this case, amounted to a contract obligatory on the parties, and therefore the judgment must be reversed, and the cause remanded for a new trial.</p>
<p><i>Chase, Justice.</i></p>
<p>I concur with my brethren, as to the <i>operation</i> of the testimony given by the <i>Providence</i> Insurance Company in evidence to the jury, and that it created no <i>legal</i> obligation on the company; but I am also of opinion that the testimony given by them in evidence was <i>inadmissible,</i> and that the circuit court ought <i>not</i> to have permitted the same to have been given in evidence to the jury.</p>
<p>The judgment of reversal was as follows, viz.</p>
<p>This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record of the circuit court, and was argued by counsel; on consideration whereof, the court is of opinion, that there is error in the proceedings and judgment of the said circuit court in this, that the court gave it in charge to the jury, that the several written papers in the record contained, and the testimony of <i>Richard Jackson,</i> in the said record also stated, did in law amount to full proof of a contract entered into between the plaintiffs and defendants, which was obligatory on both parties, whereas it is the opinion of this court, that the instruments of writing and testimony aforesaid, do not in law amount to a contract. It is therefore considered <span class="star-pagination">*170</span> by the court that the judgment aforesaid be, for this cause, reversed, and annulled, and that the cause be remanded to the said circuit court to be again tried, with direction that the testimony, in the said record contained, does not amount to evidence of a contract concluded between the parties, and that the defendants do pay to the plaintiffs their costs.</p>

<center><h1>LITTLE ET AL.<br/>

BARREME ET AL.</h1></center>
<center><p><b>Supreme Court of United States.</b></p></center>
<center>February 27, 1804.</center>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*176</span> The cause was argued at <i>December</i> term 1801, by <i>Dexter</i> for the appellants, and by <i>Martin</i> and <i>Mason</i> for the claimants.</p>
<p>MARSHALL, Chief Justice, now delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
<p>The <i>Flying-Fish</i> a <i>Danish</i> vessel having on board <i>Danish</i> and neutral property, was captured on the 2d of <i>December</i> 1799, on a voyage from <i>Jeremie</i> to <i>St. Thomas's,</i> by the <i>United States</i> frigate <i>Boston,</i> commanded by Captain <i>Little,</i> and brought into the port of <i>Boston,</i> where she was libelled as an <i>American</i> vessel that had violated the non-intercourse law.</p>
<p>The judge before whom the cause was tried, directed a restoration of the vessel and cargo as neutral property, but refused to award damages for the capture and detention, because in his opinion, there was probable cause to suspect the vessel to be <i>American.</i></p>
<p>On an appeal to the circuit court this sentence was reversed, because the <i>Flying-Fish</i> was on a voyage <i>from,</i> not <i>to,</i> a <i>French</i> port, and was therefore, had she even been an <i>American</i> vessel, not liable to capture on the high seas.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*177</span> During the hostilities between the <i>United States</i> and <i>France,</i> an act for the suspension of all intercourse between the two nations was annually passed. That under which the <i>Flying-Fish</i> was condemned, declared every vessel, owned, hired or employed wholly or in part by an <i>American,</i> which should be employed in any traffic or commerce with or for any person resident within the jurisdiction or under the authority of the <i>French</i> republic, to be forfeited together with her cargo; the one half to accrue to the <i>United States,</i> and the other to any person or persons, citizens of the <i>United States,</i> who will inform and prosecute for the same.</p>
<p>The 5th section of this act authorises the president of the <i>United States,</i> to instruct the commanders of armed vessels, "to stop and examine any ship or vessel of the <i>United States</i> on the high sea, which there may be reason to suspect to be engaged in any traffic or commerce contrary to the true tenor of the act, and if upon examination it should appear that such ship or vessel is bound or sailing <i>to</i> any port or place within the territory of the <i>French</i> republic or her dependencies, it is rendered lawful to seize such vessel, and send her into the <i>United States</i> for adjudication.</p>
<p>It is by no means clear that the president of the <i>United States</i> whose high duty it is to "take care that the laws be faithfully executed," and who is commander in chief of the armies and navies of the <i>United States,</i> might not, without any special authority for that purpose, in the then existing state of things, have empowered the officers commanding the armed vessels of the <i>United States,</i> to seize and send into port for adjudication, <i>American</i> vessels which were forfeited by being engaged in this illicit commerce. But when it is observed that the general clause of the first section of the "act, which declares that such vessels may be seized, and may be prosecuted in any district or circuit court, which shall be holden within or for the district where the seizure shall be made," obviously contemplates a seizure within the <i>United States;</i> and that the 5th section gives a special authority to seize on the high seas, and limits that authority to the seizure of vessels bound or sailing <i>to</i> a <i>French</i> port, the legislature seem to have prescribed <span class="star-pagination">*178</span> that the manner in which this law shall be carried into execution, was to exclude a seizure of any vessel not bound <i>to</i> a <i>French</i> port. Of consequence, however strong the circumstances might be, which induced captain <i>Little</i> to suspect the <i>Flying-Fish</i> to be an <i>American</i> vessel, they could not excuse the detention of her, since he would not have been authorised to detain her had she been really <i>American.</i></p>
<p>It was so obvious, that if only vessels sailing to a <i>French</i> port could be seized on the high seas, that the law would be very often evaded, that this act of congress appears to have received a different construction from the executive of the <i>United States;</i> a construction much better calculated to give it effect.</p>
<p>A copy of this act was transmitted by the secretary of the navy, to the captains of the armed vessels, who were ordered to consider the 5th section as a part of their instructions. The same letter contained the following clause. "A proper discharge of the important duties enjoined on you, arising out of this act, will require the exercise of a sound and an impartial judgment. You are not only to do all that in you lies, to prevent all intercourse, whether direct or circuitous, between the ports of the <i>United States,</i> and those of <i>France</i> or her dependencies, where the vessels <i>are apparently as well as really American,</i> and protected by <i>American</i> papers only, but you are to be vigilant that vessels or cargoes really <i>American,</i> but covered by <i>Danish</i> or other foreign papers, and bound <i>to</i> or <i>from French</i> ports, do not escape you."</p>
<p>These orders given by the executive under the construction of the act of congress made by the department to which its execution was assigned, enjoin the seizure of <i>American</i> vessels sailing from a <i>French</i> port. Is the officer who obeys them liable for damages sustained by this misconstruction of the act, or will his orders excuse him? If his instructions afford him no protection, then the law must take its course, and he must pay such damages as are legally awarded against him; if they excuse an act not otherwise excusable, it would then be necessary to inquire whether this is a case in which the probable cause <span class="star-pagination">*179</span> which existed to induce a suspicion that the vessel was <i>American,</i> would excuse the captor from damages when the vessel appeared in fact to be neutral.</p>
<p>I confess the first bias of my mind was very strong in favour of the opinion that though the instructions of the executive could not give a right, they might yet excuse from damages. I was much inclined to think that a distinction ought to be taken between acts of civil and those of military officers; and between proceedings within the body of the country and those on the high seas. That implicit obedience which military men usually pay to the orders of their superiors, which indeed is indispensably necessary to every military system, appeared to me strongly to imply the principle that those orders, if not to perform a prohibited act, ought to justify the person whose general duty it is to obey them, and who is placed by the laws of his country in a situation which in general requires that he should obey them. I was strongly inclined to think that where, in consequence of orders from the legitimate authority, a vessel is seized with pure intention, the claim of the injured party for damages would be against that government from which the orders proceeded, and would be a proper subject for negotiation. But I have been convinced that I was mistaken, and I have receded from this first opinion. I acquiesce in that of my brethren, which is, that the instructions cannot change the nature of the transaction, or legalize an act which without those instructions would have been a plain trespass.</p>
<p>It becomes therefore unnecessary to inquire whether the probable cause afforded by the conduct of the <i>Flying-Fish</i> to suspect her of being an <i>American,</i> would excuse Captain <i>Little</i> from damages for having seized and sent her into port, since had she actually been an <i>American,</i> the seizure would have been unlawful?</p>
<p>Captain <i>Little</i> then must be answerable in damages to the owner of this neutral vessel, and as the account taken by order of the circuit court is not objectionable on its face, and has not been excepted to by council before the proper tribunal, this court can receive no objection to it.</p>
<p>There appears then to be no error in the judgment of the circuit court, and it must be affirmed with costs.</p>

<center>February 28, 1804.</center>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*181</span> <i>E.J. LEE,</i> for plaintiffs in error.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*183</span> MARSHALL, Ch. J.</p>
<p>There can be no doubt of this fact. The only difficulty is to shew that it requires 20 years after the removal of the impediments, to create the presumption of payment. It may be a doubt, whether the same time after the removal of the impediments, is necessary to raise the presumption, as if the bond had borne date at the time of such removal.</p>
<p><i>Swann,</i> for defendant, contended that the time between the 19th of <i>April,</i> 1775, and <i>Sept.</i> 1783, being deducted from the age of the bond when put in suit, the residue being about 20 years, and 6 months, should be considered as the lapse of time which was to induce the presumption that the disability of the plaintiff ceased on the ratification of the treaty of peace. There are no cases decided in the superior courts of <i>Virginia,</i> in which the plea of disability of the plaintiff, as being a <i>British</i> subject, has been allowed since the peace. The cases cited are county court cases, and do not appear in the record. They are facts which this court cannot notice.</p>
<p>But if we travel out of the record, other cases may be cited from other counties, in which contrary decisions have taken place. It is a fact that in <i>Fairfax</i> county, where the defendant always resided, <i>British</i> debts could always be recovered since the year 1783. If the cases cited against us are admitted to rebut the presumption, this fact is equally strong, and ought to be admitted to support it.</p>
<p><i>Lee</i> in reply. Although it was stipulated by the treaty <span class="star-pagination">*184</span> that all legal impediments to the recovery of debts should be removed, yet that did not alter the existing state of things. The obnoxious, laws remained in full force in practice. The <i>fact</i> was, that the legal impediments were not removed. We are not now to consider what the law ought to have been, but what it was in practice. For if the impossibility of recovering the debt still remained, it destroyed all presumption arising from the lapse of time.</p>
<p>MARSHALL, Ch. J. delivered the opinion of the court.</p>
<p>The only circumstance which could create a question in this case is, that twenty years had not elapsed, exclusive of the period during which the plaintiffs were under a legal disability to recover, before the action was brought.</p>
<p>The principle, upon which the presumption of payment arises from the lapse of time, is a reasonable principle, and may be rebutted by any facts which destroy the reason of the rule.</p>
<p>That no presumption could arise during a state of war, in which the plaintiff was an alien enemy, is too clear to admit of doubt. But it is not so clear that upon a bond so old as this, the same length of time after the removal of the disability, is necessary to raise the presumption, as would be required if the bond had borne date at the time of such removal.</p>
<p>It appears from the decisions of the courts of <i>Virginia,</i> from the pleas in bar in the federal courts, and particularly from the observations of the chancellor of <i>Virginia,</i> in the case cited, that it was the general understanding of the inhabitants of that state, that <i>British</i> debts could not be recovered: And, until the year 1793, there was no decision of the superior courts that such debts were recoverable.</p>
<p>The only question is, whether, in case of an old debt, the same time is required to raise the presumption, as in the case of a debt accruing since the impediments have been removed.</p>
<p>In such a case it is not easy to establish a new rule, and <span class="star-pagination">*185</span> the court think it best to adhere to the old decisions, that twenty years must have elapsed exclusive of the period of the plaintiff's disability; and are of opinion that the circuit court erred in directing the jury that payment ought to be presumed.</p>
<p>The judgment of the court is entered upon the minutes in the following terms:</p>
<p>The court having heard the arguments of counsel, and maturely considered the same, is of opinion (and do adjudge, order, and decree accordingly) that the circuit court erred in instructing the jury "that from the length of time they were to presume the bond, in the record mentioned, to be satisfied, unless they should find, from the evidence, that interest was paid on the bond within twenty years from the 5th of <i>September</i> 1775, (the time of the last payment) or that a suit or demand was made on said bond within twenty years from the last mentioned time, exclusive, in both cases, of five years, five months, and twenty days, taken out of the act of limitations;" there being circumstances in this case which oppose the presumption which would have arisen from the length of time which has elapsed since the date of the bond.</p>
<p>And this court doth further adjudge, order, and decree, that this cause be remanded to the said circuit court, to be there tried, with directions that there is no presumption of payment of the said bond, as directed by the said circuit court.</p>

<p>It is true, as a general rule, that a man cannot reverse a judgment for error in process or delay, unless he can shew that the error was to his disadvantage; but it is also a rule, that he may reverse a judgment for an error of the Court, even though it be for his advantage. As if a verdict be found for the debt, damages, and costs; and the judgment be only for the debt and damages, the defendant may assign for error that the judgment was not also for costs, although the error is for his advantage.</p>
<p>Here it was the duty of the Court to see that they had jurisdiction, for the consent of parties could not give it.</p>

<p><span class="star-pagination">*198</span> <i>Stockton,</i> for plaintiff in error.</p>
<p><i>Adams,</i> for defendant.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*232</span> MARSHALL, C.J. delivered the opinion of the court.</p>
<p>If in this case the court had been of opinion, that the circuit court had erred in its construction of the policies, which constitute the ground of action; that is, if we had conceived that the defence set up, would have been insufficient, admitting it to have been clearly made out in point of fact, we should have deemed it right to have declared that opinion, although the case might have gone off on other points; because it is desirable to terminate every cause upon its real merits, if those merits are fairly before the court, and to put an end to litigation where it is in the power of the court to do so. But no error is perceived in the opinion given on the construction of the policies. If the proof is sufficient to shew that the loss of the vessel and cargo, was occasioned by attempting an illicit trade with the <i>Portuguese;</i> that an offence was actually committed against the laws of that nation, and that they were condemned by the government on that account, the case comes fairly within the exception of the policies, and the risk was one not intended to be insured against.</p>
<p>The words of the exception in the first policy are, "The insurers are not liable for seizure by the <i>Portuguese</i> "for illicit trade."</p>
<p>In the second policy, the words are "The insurers do not take the risk of illicit trade with the <i>Portuguese.</i>"</p>
<p>The counsel on both sides, insist that these words ought to receive the same construction, and that each exception is substantially the same.</p>
<p>The court is of the same opinion. The words themselves are not essentially variant from each other, and no reason is perceived for supposing any intention in the contracting parties to vary the risk.</p>
<p>For the plaintiff it is contended, that the terms used require an actual traffic between the vessel and inhabitants, <span class="star-pagination">*233</span> and a seizure in consequence of that traffic, or at least that the vessel should have been brought into port, in order to constitute a case which comes within the exception of the policy. But such does not seem to be the necessary import of the words. The more enlarged and liberal construction given to them by the defendants, is certainly warranted by common usage; and wherever words admit of a more extensive or more restricted signification, they must be taken in that sense which is required by the subject matter, and which will best effectuate what it is reasonable to suppose, was the real intention of the parties.</p>
<p>In this case, the unlawfulness of the voyage was perfectly understood by both parties. That the crown of <i>Portugal</i> excluded, with the most jealous watchfulness, the commercial intercourse of foreigners with their colonies, was probably a fact of as much notoriety as that foreigners had devised means to elude this watchfulness, and to carry on a gainful but very hazardous trade with those colonies. If the attempt should succeed it would be very profitable, but the risk attending it was necessarily great. It was this risk which the underwriters, on a fair construction of their words, did not mean to take upon themselves. "They are not liable," they say, "for seizure by the <i>Portuguese</i> for illicit trade." "They do not take the risk of illicit trade with the <i>Portuguese,</i>" now this illicit trade was the sole and avowed object of the voyage, and the vessel was engaged in it from the time of her leaving the port of <i>New-York.</i> The risk of this illicit trade, is separated from the various other perils to which vessels are exposed at sea, and excluded from the policy. Whenever the risk commences the exception commences also, for it is apparent that the underwriters meant to take upon themselves no portion of that hazard which was occasioned by the unlawfulness of the voyage.</p>
<p>If it could have been presumed by the parties to this contract, that the laws of <i>Portugal,</i> prohibiting commercial intercourse between their colonies and foreign merchants, permitted vessels to enter their ports, or to hover off their coasts for the purposes of trade, with impunity, and only subjected them to seizure and condemnation <span class="star-pagination">*234</span> after the very act had been committed, or if such are really their laws, then indeed the exception might reasonably be supposed to have been intended to be as limited in its construction as is contended for by the plaintiff. If the danger did not commence till the vessel was in port, or till the act of bargain and sale, without a permit from the governor, had been committed, then it would be reasonable to consider the exception as only contemplating that event. But this presumption is too extravagant to have been made. If indeed the fact itself should be so, then there is an end of presumption, and the contract will be expounded by the law; but as a general principle, the nation which prohibits commercial intercourse with its colonies, must be supposed to adopt measures to make that prohibition effectual. They must therefore, be supposed to seize vessels coming into their harbours or hovering on their coasts, in a condition to trade, and to be afterwards governed in their proceedings with respect to those vessels by the circumstances which shall appear in evidence. That the officers of that nation are induced occasionally to dispense with their laws, does not alter them, or legalize the trade they prohibit. As they may be executed at the will of the governor, there is always danger that they will be executed, and that danger the insurers have not chosen to take upon themselves.</p>
<p>That the law of nations prohibits the exercise of any act of authority over a vessel in the situation of the <i>Aurora,</i> and that this seizure is, on that account, a mere marine trespass, not within the exception, cannot be admitted. To reason from the extent of protection a nation will afford to foreigners to the extent of the means it may use for its own security does not seem to be perfectly correct. It is opposed by principles which are universally acknowledged. The authority of a nation within its own territory is absolute and exclusive. The seizure of a vessel within the range of its cannon by a foreign force is an invasion of that territory, and is a hostile act which it is its duty to repel. But its power to secure itself from injury, may certainly be exercised beyond the limits of its territory. Upon this principle the right of a belligerent to search a neutral vessel on the high seas for contraband of war, is universally <span class="star-pagination">*235</span> admitted, because the belligerent has a right to prevent the injury done to himself by the assistance intended for his enemy: so too a nation has a right to prohibit any commerce with its colonies. Any attempt to violate the laws made to protect this right, is an injury to itself which it may prevent, and it has a right to use the means necessary for its prevention. These means do not appear to be limited within any certain marked boundaries, which remain the same at all times and in all situations. If they are such as unnecessarily to vex and harrass foreign lawful commerce, foreign nations will resist their exercise. If they are such as are reasonable and necessary to secure their laws from violation, they will be submitted to.</p>
<p>In different seas and on different coasts, a wider or more contracted range, in which to exercise the vigilance of the government, will be assented to. Thus in the channel, where a very great part of the commerce to and from all the north of Europe, passes through a very narrow sea, the seizure of vessels on suspicion of attempting an illicit trade, must necessarily be restricted to very narrow limits, but on the coast of <i>South America,</i> seldom frequented by vessels but for the purpose of illicit trade, the vigilance of the government may be extended somewhat further; and foreign nations submit to such regulations as are reasonable in themselves, and are really necessary to secure that monopoly of colonial commerce, which is claimed by all nations holding distant possessions.</p>
<p>If this right be extended too far, the exercise of it will be resisted. It has occasioned long and frequent contests, which have sometimes ended in open war. The <i>English,</i> it will be well recollected, complained of the right claimed by <i>Spain</i> to search their vessels on the high seas, which was carried so far that the <i>guarda costas</i> of that nation, seized vessels not in the neighbourhood of their coasts. This practice was the subject of long and fruitless negotiations, and at length of open war. The right of the <i>Spaniards</i> was supposed to be exercised unreasonably and vexatiously, but it never was contended that it could only be exercised within the range of the cannon from their barrteries. Indeed the <span class="star-pagination">*236</span> right given to our own revenue cutters, to visit vessels four leagues from our coast, is a declaration that in the opinion of the <i>American</i> government, no such principle as that contended for, has a real existence.</p>
<p>Nothing there is to be drawn from the laws or usages of nations, which gives to this part of the contract before the court the very limited construction which the plaintiff insists on, or which proves that the seizure of the <i>Aurora,</i> by the <i>Portuguese</i> governor, was an act of lawless violence.</p>
<p>The argument that such act would be within the policy, and not within the exception, is admitted to be well founded. That the exclusion from the insurance of "the risk of illicit trade with the <i>Portuguese,</i>" is an exclusion only of that risk, to which such trade is by law exposed, will be readily conceded.</p>
<p>It is unquestionably limited and restrained by the terms "illicit trade." No seizure, not justifiable under the laws and regulations established by the crown of <i>Portugal,</i> for the restriction of foreign commerce with its dependencies, can come within this part of the contract, and every seizure which is justifiable by those laws and regulations, must be deemed within it.</p>
<p>To prove that the <i>Aurora</i> and her cargo were sequestered at <i>Para,</i> in conformity with the laws of <i>Portugal,</i> two edicts and the judgment of sequestration have been produced by the defendants in the Circuit Court. These documents were objected to on the principle that they were not properly authenticated, but the objection was overruled, and the judges permitted them to go to the jury.</p>
<p>The edicts of the crown are certified by the <i>American</i> consul at <i>Lisbon</i> to be copies from the original law of the realm, and this certificate is granted under his official seal.</p>
<p>Foreign laws are well understood to be facts which must, like other facts, be proved to exist before they can be received in a court of justice. The principle <span class="star-pagination">*237</span> that the best testimony shall be required which the nature of the thing admits of; or, in other words, that no testimony shall be received which presupposes better testimony attainable by the party who offers it, applies to foreign laws as it does to all other facts. The sanction of an oath is required for their establishment, unless they can be verified by some other such high authority that the law respects it not less than the oath of an individual.</p>
<p>In this case the edicts produced are not verified by an oath. The consul has not sworn; he has only certified that they are truly copied from the originals. To give to this certificate the force of testimony it will be necessary to shew that this is one of those consular functions to which, to use its own language, the laws of this country attach full faith and credit.</p>
<p>Consuls, it is said, are officers known to the law of nations, and are entrusted with high powers. This is very true, but they do not appear to be entrusted with the power of authenticating the laws of foreign nations. They are not the keepers of those laws. They can grant no official copies of them. There appears no reason for assigning to their certificate respecting a foreign law any higher or different degree of credit, than would be assigned to their certificates of any other fact.</p>
<p>It is very truly stated that to require respecting laws, or other transactions, in foreign countries that species of testimony which their institutions and usages do not admit of would be unjust and unreasonable. The court will never require such testimony. In this, as in all other cases, no testimony will be required which is shewn to be unattainable. But no civilized nation will be presumed to refuse those acts for authenticating instruments which are usual, and which are deemed necessary for the purposes of justice. It cannot be presumed that an application to authenticate an edict by the seal of the nation would be rejected, unless the fact should appear to the court. Nor can it be presumed that any difficulty exists in obtaining a copy. Indeed in this very case the very testimony offered would contradict such a presumption. The paper offered to the <span class="star-pagination">*238</span> court is certified to be a copy compared with the original. It is impossible to suppose that this copy might not have been authenticated by the oath of the consul as well as by his certificate.</p>
<p>It is asked in what manner this oath should itself have been authenticated, and it is supposed that the consular seal must ultimately have been resorted to for this purpose. But no such necessity exists. Commissions are always granted for taking testimony abroad, and the commissioners have authority to administer oaths and to certify the depositions by them taken.</p>
<p>The edicts of <i>Portugal,</i> then, not having been proved, ought not to have been laid before the jury.</p>
<p>The paper offered as a true copy from the original proceedings against the <i>Aurora,</i> is certified under the seal of his arms by <i>D. Jono de Almeida de Mello de Castro,</i> who states himself to be the secretary of state for foreign affairs, and the consul certifies the <i>English</i> copy which accompanies it to be a true translation of the <i>Portuguese</i> original.</p>
<p>Foreign judgments are authenticated,</p>
<p>1. By an exemplification under the great seal.</p>
<p>2. By a copy proved to be a true copy.</p>
<p>3. By the certificate of an officer authorised by law, which certificate must itself be properly authenticated.</p>
<p>These are the usual and appear to be the most proper, if not the only modes of verifying foreign judgments. If they be all beyond the reach of the party, other testimony inferior in its nature might be received. But it does not appear that there was any insuperable impediment to the use of either of these modes, and the court cannot presume such impediment to have existed. Nor is the certificate which has been obtained an admissible substitute for either of them.</p>
<p>If it be true that the decrees of the colonies are transmitted <span class="star-pagination">*239</span> to the seat of government, and registered in the department of state, a certificate of that fact under the great seal, with a copy of the decree authenticated in the same manner, would be sufficient <i>prima facie</i> evidence of the verity of what was so certified; but the certificate offered to the court is under the private seal of the person giving it, which cannot be known to this court, and of consequence can authenticate nothing. The paper, therefore, purporting to be a sequestration of the <i>Aurora</i> and her cargo in <i>Para</i> ought not to have been laid before the jury</p>
<p>Admitting the originals in the <i>Portuguese</i> language to have been authenticated properly, yet there was error in admitting the translation to have been read on the certificate of the consul. Interpreters are always sworn, and the translation of a consul not on oath can have no greater validity than that of any other respectable man.</p>
<p>If the court erred in admitting as testimony papers which ought not to have been received, the judgment is of course to be reversed and a new trial awarded. It is urged that there is enough in the record to induce a jury to find a verdict for the defendants, independent of the testimony objected to, and that, in saying what judgment the court below ought to have rendered, a direction to that effect might be given. If this was even true in point of fact, the inference is not correctly drawn. Â— There must be a new trial, and at that new trial each party is at liberty to produce new evidence. Of consequence this court can give no instructions respecting that evidence.</p>
<p>The judgment must be reversed with costs and the cause remanded to be again tried in the circuit court, with instructions not to permit the copies of the edicts of <i>Portugal</i> and the sentence in the proceedings mentioned, to go to the jury, unless they be authenticated according to law.<sup>[*]</sup></p>
<h2>NOTES</h2>
<p>[*]  In the argument of this case, a question was suggested by CHASE, J. whether a bill of exceptions would lay to a charge given by the judge to the jury, unless it be upon a point on which the opinion of the court was prayed; and doubted whether it would within the statute of Westminster.
</p>
<p>MARSHALL, C.J. thought that it would, and observed that in <i>England</i> the correctness of the instruction of the judge to the jury at <i>Nisi Prius,</i> usually came before the court on a motion for a new trial, and if in this country, the question could not come up by a bill of exceptions, the party would be without remedy.</p>

<center><h1>WILLIAM MASON AND OTHERS, LIBELLANTS.<br/>
v.<br/>
SHIP BLAIREAU.</h1></center>
<center><p><b>Supreme Court of United States.</b></p></center>
<center>March 6, 1804.</center>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*248</span> The case was now argued by <i>Harper</i> for the owners of the <i>Blaireau,</i> for <i>Christie &amp; Young</i> and for the apprentices Â— by <i>Hollingsworth,</i> attorney of the <i>United States</i> for <i>Maryland</i> district, for the libellants generally Â— by <i>Martin,</i> attorney-general of <i>Maryland,</i> for <i>Jackson</i> the owner, and <i>Mason</i> the master, of the <i>Firm,</i> and for the owners of the <i>Blaireau</i> Â— and by <i>S. Chase, jun.</i> for the owners of the <i>Blaireau.</i></p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*263</span> <i>Marshall, Chief Justice,</i> delivered the opinion of the court.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*264</span> In this case, a preliminary question has been made, by the counsel for the plaintiffs, which ought not to be disregarded. As the parties interested except the owners of the cargo of the <i>Firm,</i> are not <i>Americans,</i> a doubt has been suggested, respecting the jurisdiction of the court, and upon a reference to authorities, the point does not appear to have been ever settled, These doubts, seem rather founded on the idea, that upon principles of general policy, this court ought not to take cognizance of a case entirely between foreigners, than from any positive incapacity to do so. On weighing the considerations drawn from public convenience, those in favour of the jurisdiction, appear much to overbalance those against it, and it is the opinion of this court, that, whatever doubts may exist in a case, where the jurisdiction may be objected to, there ought to be none where the parties assent to it.</p>
<p>The previous question being disposed of, the court will proceed to consider the several cases, which have grown out of the libel filed in the district court.</p>
<p>The first to be decided, is that of the captain of the <i>Firm,</i> who, by the sentence of the circuit court, was declared to have forfeited his right to salvage, by having embezzled a part of the cargo of the <i>Blaireau.</i></p>
<p>The fact is not contested, but it is contended that the embezzlement proved in the cause does not affect the right of the captain to salvage.</p>
<p>The arguments in support of this position shall very briefly be reviewed. It is insisted that the embezzlement was made, after the vessel was brought into port, and this seems to be considered as a circumstance material to the influence which the embezzlement ought to have in the case. So far as respects the fact, the evidence is that the articles were brought on board the <i>Firm,</i> when the <i>Blaireau</i> was found at sea, and the fraud was detected in the port of <i>Baltimore.</i> When the concealment took place does not appear, but it would be straining very hard, to presume that it took place after arriving in port. It is not however, perceived that this need be the subject of very minute <span class="star-pagination">*265</span> inquiry, since the fact must have occurred before he parted with the possession acquired by the act, on the merit of which his claim for salvage is founded.</p>
<p>It is also stated, that this court has no jurisdiction of the crime committed by the captain, and cannot notice it even incidentally.</p>
<p>If it was intended merely to prove, that this court could not convict captain <i>Mason</i> of felony, and punish him for that offence, there certainly could never have been a doubt entertained on the subject; but when it is inferred from thence, that the court can take no notice of the fact, the correctness of the conclusion is not perceived. It is believed to be universally true, that when a claim of any sort is asserted in court, all those circumstances which go to defeat the claim, and to show that the person asserting it has not a right to recover, may and ought to be considered. The real question, therefore, is, whether the claim for salvage is affected by the act of embezzlement; and if it is, the incapacity of this court to proceed criminally against the captain, forms no objection to their examining a fact, which goes to the very foundation of his right.</p>
<p>The legal right of the salvors is insisted on, and it is said, that in trover for the ship and cargo by the owners, salvage would be allowed to those who had rendered the service, and then openly converted them to their own use.</p>
<p>Yet the jury, trying the action, would determine on the right to salvage, and would inquire into any fact which went to defeat that right.</p>
<p>Whatever shape then may be given to the question, it still resolves itself into the inquiry, whether the embezzlement of part of the cargo, does really intermingle itself with, and infect the whole transaction in such a manner, as to destroy any claim founded on it.</p>
<p>The counsel for this plaintiff contends, that the merits of Captain <i>Mason</i> as a salvor, are to impaired by the court upon him <span class="star-pagination">*266</span> against a debt, and the claim for salvage is in nature of a debt.</p>
<p>This leads to an inquiry into the principles on which salvage is allowed. If the property of an individual on land be exposed to the greatest peril, and be saved by the voluntary exertions of any person whatever; if valuable goods be rescued from a house in flames, at the imminent hazard of life by the salvor, no remuneration in the shape of salvage is allowed. The act is highly meritorious, and the service is as great as if rendered at sea. Yet the claim for salvage could not, perhaps, be supported. It is certainly not made. Let precisely the same service, at precisely the same hazard, be rendered at sea, and a very ample reward will be bestowed in the courts of justice.</p>
<p>If we search for the motives producing this apparent prodigality, in rewarding services rendered at sea, we shall find them in a liberal and enlarged policy. The allowance of a very ample compensation for those services, (one very much exceeding the mere risk encountered, and labour employed in effecting them,) is intended as an inducement to render them, which it is for the public interests, and for the general interests of humanity, to hold forth to those who navigate the ocean. It is perhaps difficult, on any other principle, to account satisfactorily for the very great difference which is made between the retribution allowed for services at sea and on land: neither will a fair calculation of the real hazard or labour, be a foundation for such a difference; nor will the benefit received always account for it.</p>
<p>It a wise and humane policy be among the essential principles, which induce a continuance in the allowance of that liberal compensation which is made for saving a vessel at sea, we must at once perceive the ground on which it is refused to the person whose conduct ought to be punished instead of being rewarded. That same policy which is so very influential, in producing the very liberal allowances made by way of salvage, requires that those allowances should be withheld from persons, who avail themselves of the opportunity, furnished <span class="star-pagination">*267</span> them by the possession of the property of another, to embezzle that property. While the general interests of society require that the most powerful inducements should be held forth to men, to save life and property about to perish at sea, they also require that those inducements should likewise be held forth to a fair and upright conduct, with regard to the objects thus preserved. This would certainly justify the reduction of the claim, to a bare compensation on the principles of a real <i>quantum meruit,</i> and the losses in the cargo, which may be imputed to the captain, would balance that account, if, as is contended by his counsel, the court could not, on principles generally received, consider the act of embezzlement as a total forfeiture of all right to salvage.</p>
<p>But the case of a mariner, who forfeits his right to wages by embezzling any part of the cargo, is precisely in point. That case stands on the same principles with this, and is a full authority for this, since it cannot be denied, that the right to salvage is forfeited by the same act that would forfeit the right to wages.</p>
<p>In the case of Mr. <i>Stevenson,</i> the fact is not clearly ascertained. If the embezzlement was fixed upon him, he as well as the captain ought to forfeit his salvage. But it is not fixed. Yet there are circumstances in the case, which, if he stands acquitted of the charge of unfairness, do certainly so implicate him in that of carelessness as to destroy his pretensions to superior compensation, and reduce his claim to a level with that of a common mariner.</p>
<p>The decree of the circuit court, being approved so far as respects Captain <i>Mason</i> and Mr. <i>Stevenson,</i> the general rate of salvage allowed by that decree, is next to be considered.</p>
<p>There is certainly no positive rule, which governs absolutely the rate of salvage. Yet in fixing it, the common usage of commercial nations, and especially of those whose subjects are interested in the particular case, ought unquestionably to be regarded. In <i>France,</i> it appears, that a service like that rendered the owners of the <span class="star-pagination">*268</span> <i>Blaireau,</i> would have been compensated with one-third of the value of the vessel and cargo. In <i>England</i> the principle of reciprocity, if not adopted, is much respected, and to judge from the tenor of their cases on this subject, it is fairly presumable that the salvage which would be allowed in an <i>English</i> court in a case like the present, would not greatly vary from that which appears to be made by the ordinances of <i>France.</i></p>
<p>This is unquestionably a case of great merit, and a very liberal salvage ought to be allowed. Yet that allowed both by the district and circuit courts, appears to exceed any sum which those principles, which ought to be resorted to as guides in the case, will justify. Among the various adjudications of the courts of admiralty in <i>England,</i> to which country the salvors belong, no one has been found where so large an allowance has been made; and in <i>France</i> the nation of the owners of the property saved, a positive ordinance is understood to regulate this subject, and to fix the salvage at one-third of the gross value of what has been preserved.</p>
<p>Taking the whole subject into consideration, the court is disposed to reduce the rate of salvage, and to allow about two-fifths instead of three-fifths to the salvors. The vessel and cargo will then be really charged, in consequence of the savings produced by the forfeiture of the captain's claim, and the reduction of those of the mate and Mr. <i>Christie,</i> with not more than one-third of the gross value of the property.</p>
<p>In the distribution of this sum, the court does not entirely approve the decree which has been rendered in the circuit court.</p>
<p>The proportion allowed the owners of the <i>Firm,</i> and her cargo, is not equal to the risk incurred, nor does it furnish an inducement to the owners of vessels to permit their captains to save those found in distress at sea, in any degree proportioned to the inducements offered to the captains and crew. The same policy ought to extend to all concerned, the same rewards for a service designed to be encouraged, and it is surely no reward to a man, made his own insurer without his own consent, <span class="star-pagination">*269</span> to return him very little more than the premium he had advanced.</p>
<p>The common course of decisions, too, has established a very different ratio for the distribution of salvage money, and the court is of opinion, that those decisions are founded on substantial considerations.</p>
<p>The owners of the vessel and cargo, in this case, will be allowed one-third of the whole amount of salvage decreed, which third is to be divided between them in the proportion established in the district court, it being in our opinion very clear, that the owner of the vessel continued to risk the freight, after as much as before the assent of Mr. <i>Christie,</i> to the measures necessary for saving the <i>Blaireau.</i> That assent could only be construed, to charge him with the hazards to be encountered by the cargo, and not to vary the contract respecting the freight.</p>
<p>The proportions established, by the decree of the circuit court, between those who navigated the <i>Firm,</i> and those who navigated the <i>Blaireau,</i> and between the individuals in each ship, are all approved with this exception. The case exhibits no peculiar merits in Mr. <i>Christie,</i> and therefore, his allowance is not to exceed that of a seaman on board that vessel.</p>
<p>On the rights of <i>Toole</i> and the apprentices, this court entirely concurs in opinion with the district and circuit courts.</p>
<p>There was certainly no individual, who assisted in bringing in the <i>Blaireau,</i> that contributed so much to her preservation as <i>Toole.</i> Every principle of justice, and every feeling of the heart, must arrange itself on the side of his claim.</p>
<p>But it is contended, that the contract he had entered into bound him to continue his endeavours to bring the vessel into port, and that the principles of general policy, forbid the allowance of salvage to a mariner belonging to the ship which has been preserved.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*270</span> The claims upon him, on the ground of contract, are urged with a very ill grace indeed. It little becomes those who devoted him to the waves to set up a title to his further services. The captain, who was entrusted by the owner with power over the vessel and her crew, had discharged him from all further duty under his contract, as far as any act whatever could discharge him, and it is not for the owner now to revive this abandoned claim.</p>
<p>Those principles of policy which withhold from the mariners of a ship their wages on her being lost, and which deny them salvage for saving their ship, however great the peril may be, cannot apply to a case like this. Â— There is no danger that a single seaman can be induced or enabled, by the prospect of the reward given to <i>Toole,</i> to prevail on the officers and crew of a vessel to abandon her to the mercy of the waves, for the purpose of entitling the person who remains in her to salvage, if she should be fortunately preserved.</p>
<p>The claim of the master to the salvage allowed his apprentices, is one which the court feels no disposition to support, unless the law of the case be clearly with him. The authorities, cited by his counsel, do not come up to this case. The right of the master to the earnings of his apprentice, in the way of his business, or of any other business which is substituted for it, is different from a right to his extraordinary earnings which do not interfere with the profits the master may legitimately derive from his service. Of this latter description is salvage. It is an extra benefit, the reception of which does not deduct from the profits the master is entitled to from his service. But the case cited from <i>Robinson,</i> where salvage was actually decreed to an apprentice, is in point. The counsel does not appear to the court to construe that case correctly, when he says, that it does not determine the right as between the master and the apprentice. The fair understanding of the case is, that the money was decreed to the apprentice, and was to be paid for his benefit.</p>
<p>Considering the case strictly on principle, that portion of the salvage allowed ought to be paid to the master, which would compensate him for having risked the future service of his apprentice; but as this would not amount to a very considerable sum, and as a liberal salvage has <span class="star-pagination">*271</span> already been decreed to the master, this further allowance will not be made in this case.</p>
<p>Upon these principles the following decree is to be entered.</p>
<p>"This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record of the circuit court, and was argued by counsel, on consideration whereof this court doth reverse the sentence of the circuit court, so far as the same is inconsistent with the principles and opinions herein after stated:</p>
<p>"This court is of opinion, that too large a proportion of the net proceeds of the ship <i>Blaireau</i> and her cargo, has been allowed to the salvors, and that 21,400 dollars is a sufficient retribution for the service performed, which sum is decreed to the claimants, except captain <i>Mason</i> whose rights are forfeited by embezzling a part of the cargo, in full of their demands. In distributing the sum thus allowed, this court is of opinion, that the owners of the <i>Firm</i> and her cargo, ought to receive one-third of the whole amount thereof, of which one-third the proportion of the owner of the vessel ought to be to that of the owner of the cargo, as the value of the vessel and freight is to the value of the cargo Â— that is, as 18 to 4.</p>
<p>"It is further the opinion of the court, that the remaining two-thirds of the salvage allowed, ought to be divided between those who navigated both the <i>Firm</i> and the <i>Blaireau,</i> excluding Captain <i>Mason,</i> in the proportions directed by the circuit court, with this exception, that the sum to be received by <i>Charles Christie,</i> is to be the same with that received by a seaman on board the <i>Blaireau.</i></p>
<p>"In every thing not contrary to the principles herein contained, the decree of the circuit court is affirmed, and the cause is remanded to the said circuit court to be further proceeded in, according to the directions given. The parties are to pay their own costs."</p>

<p class="date">February Term, 1804</p>
<div class="prelims">
<p class="indent">THIS case came before the court on a certificate of a division of the judges of the circuit court of the district of North Carolina.</p>
<p class="indent">The certificate set forth:</p>
<p class="indent">'United States of America, North Carolina district.</p>
<p class="indent">'At a circuit court of the United States, begun and held at Raleigh for the district of North Carolina, on Wednesday the twenty-ninth of December, in the year of our Lord, one thousand eight hundred and two, and in the twenty-seventh year of American independence.</p>
<p class="indent">'Present, the honourable John Marshall and Henry Potter, esquires.</p>
<p class="indent">'Robert Ogden, administrator de bonis non with the will annexed of <i>Samuel Cornell v. Richard Blackledge,</i> executor of Robert Salter deceased.</p>
<p class="indent">'State of the pleadings.</p>
<p class="indent">'This is an action of debt upon a bond given by the defendant's testator, to the testator of the plaintiff, on the second day of March 1775.</p>
<p class="indent">'The defendant, among other pleas, pleads in bar an act of the general assembly of the state of North Carolina, passed in the year 1715, entitled, 'an act concerning proving wills and granting letters of administration; and to prevent frauds in the management of intestate estates;' the ninth section of which is in the following words:</p>
<p class="indent">'And be it further enacted, that creditors of any persons deceased, shall make their claim within seven years after the death of said debtor, otherwise such creditor shall be for ever barred.</p>
<p class="indent">'To which plea the plaintiff replies, in substance, that the plaintiff's testator was, at his death, a British subject, and the debt within the true intent and operation of the fourth article of the treaty of peace concluded between the King of Great Britain and the United States.</p>
<p class="indent">'To this replication the defendant demurs, and the plaintiff joins in demurrer.</p>
<p class="indent">'This case coming on to be argued at this term, it occurred as a question, whether the act of assembly, recited in the plea of the defendant, was, under all the circumstances stated, and the various acts passed by the legislature of North Carolina, a bar in this action.</p>
<p class="indent">'On which question, the opinions of the judges were opposed.</p>
<p class="indent">'Whereupon, on a motion of the plaintiff, by his counsel, that the point on which the disagreement hath happened may, during the term, be stated under the direction of the judges, and certified under the seal of the court, to be supreme court, to be finally decided,</p>
<p class="indent">'It is ordered, that the foregoing state of the pleadings and the following statement of facts, which is made under the direction of judges, be certified, according to the request of the plaintiff by his counsel, and the law in that case made and provided; to wit,</p>
<p class="indent">'1. That Samuel Cornell, the plaintiff's testator, was, and till his death continued to be, a subject of the king of Great Britain; and the defendant's testator was, and till his death continued to be, a citizen or North Carolina.</p>
<p class="indent">'2. That the defendant's testator died in the year one thousand seven hundred and eighty; and the defendant in the same year was qualified as executor.</p>
<p class="indent">'3. That the plaintiff sued out his writ in this suit on the fifth day of October, in the year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and ninety-eight.'</p>
<p class="indent">The question in the case was, whether the plaintiff was barred of his action by the ninth section of the act of the assembly of North Carolina, passed in 1715.</p>
<p class="indent">The laws of the state of North Carolina, which operated on the question, certified by the circuit court, were:â€”â€”</p>
<p class="indent">An act passed in April 1784, entitled, a supplemental act to an act entitled an act for proving of wills, and granting administration, and to prevent frauds in the management of intestates' estates: '1. Whereas it is enacted in the ninth section of the said act, 'that creditors of any person deceased shall make their claims in seven years after the death of such debtor, otherwise such creditor shall be for ever barred; and if it shall happen that any sum or sums of money, shall hereafter remain in the hands of any administrator after the term of seven years shall be expired, and not recovered by any of kin to the deceased, or by any creditor in that time, the same shall be paid to the church wardens and vestry, to and for the use of the parish, where the said money shall remain.' And as there are no church wardens and vestry to make claim in such cases,</p>
<p class="indent">'2. Be it therefore enacted, &amp;c. that as soon as an administrator shall have finished his administration on such estates, and no creditor shall make any further demand, the residue of such estate shall be deposited in the treasury, and there remain without interest, subject to the claim of creditors and the lawful representatives of such decedent, without being subject to limitation or time.</p>
<p class="indent">'3. And be it further enacted, &amp;c. that the treasurer is hereby authorized and empowered, in all such cases, to demand payment of such administrator, and on refusal or delay, to give notice of thirty days to appear and show cause why he refuses or delays payment, and on non-appearance to enter up judgment and thereon proceed to execution for the purposes aforesaid.'</p>
<p class="indent">An act passed in 1789, entitled, an act to amend an act entitled an act concerning providing of wills and granting letters of administration, and to prevent frauds in the management of intestates' estates:</p>
<p class="indent">'4. And be it further enacted, &amp;c. that the creditors of any person or persons deceased, if he or they reside within this state, shall, within two years, and if they reside without the limits of this state shall within three years from the qualification of the executors or administrators, exhibit and make demand of their respective accounts, debts and claims of every kind whatever, to such executors or administrators; and if any creditor or creditors shall hereafter fail to demand and bring suit for the recovery of his, her or their debt as above specified, within the aforesaid time limited, he, she or they shall be for ever debarred from the recovery of his, her or their debt in any court of law or equity, or before any justice of peace within this state.'</p>
<p class="indent">There is a saving to infants, persons non compos, and femes coverts, and a proviso that the delay shall not be a bar, if it is at the special request of the defendant.</p>
<p class="indent">'6. And be it further enacted, that all laws and parts of laws that come within the purview and meaning of this act, are hereby declared void and of no effect.'</p>
<p class="indent">And, an act to explain an act passed in one thousand seven hundred and eighty-nine, entitled an act to amend an act concerning proving of wills and granting letters of administration, and to prevent frauds in the management of intestates' estates, passed in one thousand seven hundred and fifteen, and for other purposes:</p>
<p class="indent">'Whereas doubts have been entertained whether that part of the ninth section of the said act, passed in one thousand seven hundred and fifteen, which requires the creditors of any person deceased, to make their claims within seven years after the decease of such debtor, or be for ever barred, is or is not repealed by the said act, passed in one thousand seven hundred and eighty-nine:</p>
<p class="indent">'1. Be it enacted, &amp;c. that the said act passed in the year one thousand seven hundred and eighty-nine, shall not be considered as a repeal of that part of the ninth section of the act passed in the year one thousand seven hundred and fifteen aforesaid; but that the same shall be deemed, held and taken to be in full force.' Also, an act for establishing courts of law and for regulating the proceedings therein:</p>
<p class="indent">'101. Provided, that no person who hath taken, or shall take, part with the enemies of America, or who hath or shall refuse, when lawfully required thereto, to take the oath of allegiance and abjuration required by the laws of this state, or who hath or shall remove from this state, or any of the United States, to avoid giving their assistance in repelling the invasions of the common enemy, or who hath or shall reside, or be, under the dominion of the enemies of America, other than such as are detained as prisoners of war, nor any person claiming by assignment, representation or otherwise, by or under any such person, shall have or receive any benefit of this act; but all right of commencing and prosecuting any suit or suits, action or actions, real, personal or mixed, shall be, and is hereby suspended, and shall remain suspended until the legislature shall make further provision relative thereto.' Also, an act declaring the treaty of peace between the United States of America and the King of Great Britain, to be part of the law of the land.</p>
<p class="indent">'1. Be it enacted, &amp;c. that the articles of the definitive treaty between the United States of America and the King of Great Britain, are hereby declared to be part of the law of the land.</p>
<p class="indent">'11. And be it further enacted, &amp;c. that the courts of law and equity are hereby declared in all causes and questions cognizable by them respecting the said treaty to judge accordingly.' Justice CUSHING delivered the opinion of the court.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p1">

<p class="indent">This court having considered the question, whether the act of assembly recited in the plea of the defendant was, under all the circumstances stated and the various acts passed by the legislature of North Carolina, a bar in this action, which question, in consequence of an opposition in the opinion of the judges of the circuit court for the district of North Carolina, was certified to this court to be finally settled; is of opinion that the act of assembly recited in the said plea, is, under all the circumstances stated, no bar to the plaintiff's action, the same having been repealed by the act of 1789, ch. 23, at which time seven years had not elapsed from the final ratification of the treaty of peace between Great Britain and the United States, that being the period when the act of limitations began to run against debts due by citizens of the United States to British creditors.</p>

<p class="date">February Term, 1805</p>
<div class="prelims">
<p class="indent">THIS cause came up from the circuit court of the state of Massachusetts, on a certificate of division in opinion between the judges of that court.</p>
<p class="indent">In that court an action of debt was instituted for the penalty of $2000 imposed by the second section of the act of congress, passed the 22d of March 1794, 'to prohibit the carrying on the slave trade from the United States to any foreign place or country.' 1 <i>Story's L. U. S.</i> 319.</p>
<p class="indent">The second section provides, 'that all and every person building, fitting out, or equipping, loading or otherwise preparing or sending away any ship or vessel, knowing or intending that the same shall be employed in the slave trade, contrary to the true intent and meaning of the act, or any ways aiding or abetting therein, shall severally forfeit and pay the sum of $2000; one moiety thereof to the use of the United States, and the other moiety thereof to the use of him or her who shall sue for and prosecute the same.' To this suit the defendant pleaded that the cause of action, set forth in the plaintiff's writ and declaration, did not accrue within two years next before the date and issuing forth of the writ in this case against him, in manner and form as the plaintiff hath declared, and this he is ready to verify. Wherefore, &amp;c. To which plea there was a general demurrer and joinder.</p>
<p class="indent">This plea was founded upon the thirty-first section of the act of congress, entitled 'an act for the punishment of certain crimes against the United States,' passed 30th April, 1790. 1 <i>Story's L. U. S.</i> 83.</p>
<p class="indent">The section is in these words, 'that no person or persons shall be prosecuted, tried or punished for treason, or other capital offence aforesaid, wilful murder or forgery excepted; unless the indictment for the same shall be found by a grand jury within three years next after the treason or capital offence aforesaid shall be done or committed: nor shall any person be prosecuted, tried or punished for any offence not capital, nor for any fine or forfeiture under any penal statute, unless the indictment or information for the same shall be found or instituted within two years from the time of committing the offence, or incurring the fine or forfeiture as aforesaid: provided, that nothing, herein contained, shall extend to any person or persons fleeing from justice.'</p>
<p class="indent">Upon the defence under this plea, the judges of the circuit court were divided in opinion, and the same was certified to this court.</p>
<p class="indent">For the plaintiff, it was contended that the same limitation was not intended to be applied to suits for penalties. Cited <i>Atcheson v. Everett,</i> <i>Cooper</i>, 391. <i>Cunningham's Law Dict.</i> title Limitation. 5 <i>Mod.</i> 425. <i>Rex v. Gaul,</i> 1 <i>Salk.</i> 372. Heck's case, 1 <i>Salk.</i> 373.</p>
<p class="indent">[Argument of Counsel from pages 337-339 intentionally omitted] Chief Justice MARSHALL delivered the opinion of the court.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p1">
<span class="num">1</span>
<p class="indent">This is an action of debt brought to recover a penalty imposed by the act, entitled 'an act to prohibit the carrying an the slave trade from the United States to any foreign place or country.'</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p2">
<span class="num">2</span>
<p class="indent">It was pleaded in bar of the action, that the offence was not committed within two years previous to the institution of the suit. To this plea the plaintiff demurred, and the circuit court being divided on its sufficiency, the point has been certified to this court.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p3">
<span class="num">3</span>
<p class="indent">In the argument, the plaintiff has rested his case on two points. He contends,</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p4">
<span class="num">4</span>
<p class="indent">1. That the act of congress, pleaded by the defendant, is no bar to an action of debt.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p5">
<span class="num">5</span>
<p class="indent">2. That if it be a bar, it applies only to the recovery of penalties given by acts which existed at the time of its passage.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p6">
<span class="num">6</span>
<p class="indent">The words of the act are, 'nor shall any person be prosecuted,' &amp;c. It is contended that the prosecutions limited by this law, are those only which are carried on in the form of an indictment or information, and not those where the penalty is demanded by an action of debt.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p7">
<span class="num">7</span>
<p class="indent">But if the words of the act be examined, they will be found to apply not to any particular mode of proceeding, but generally to any prosecution, trial, or punishment for the offence. It is not declared that no indictment shall be found, or information filed for any offence not capital, or for any fine or forfeiture under any penal statute, unless the same be instituted within two years after the commission of the offence. In that case the act would be pleadable only in bar of the particular action. But it is declared, that 'no person shall be prosecuted, tried or punished,' words which show an intention, not merely to limit any particular form of action, but to limit any prosecution whatever.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p8">
<span class="num">8</span>
<p class="indent">It is true that general expressions may be restrained by subsequent particular words, which show that in the intention of the legislature, those general expressions are used in a particular sense: and the argument is a strong one, which contends that the latter words describing the remedy, imply a restriction on those which precede them. Most frequently they would do so. But in the statute under consideration, a distinct member of the sentence, describing one entire class of offences, would be rendered almost totally useless by the construction insisted on by the attorney for the United States. Almost every fine or forfeiture under a penal statute, may be recovered by an action of debt as well as by information; and to declare that the information was barred while the action of debt was left without limitation, would be to attribute a capriciousness on this subject to the legislature, which could not be accounted for; and to declare that the law did not apply to cases on which an action of debt is maintainable, would be to overrule express words, and to give the statute almost the same construction which it would receive if one distinct member of the sentence was expunged from it. In this particular case, the statute which creates the forfeiture does not prescribe the mode of demanding it; consequently, either debt or information would lie. It would be singular if the one remedy should be barred and the other left unrestrained.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p9">
<span class="num">9</span>
<p class="indent">In support of the opinion, that an act of limitations to criminal prosecutions can only be used as a bar in cases declared by law to be criminal at the time the act of limitations was passed, unless there be express words extending it to crimes to be created in future, <i>Cunningham's Law Dictionary</i> has been cited.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p10">
<span class="num">10</span>
<p class="indent">The case in <i>Cunningham</i> is reported in 1 <i>Salk.</i> and 5 <i>Mod.</i> and seems to be founded on the peculiar phraseology of the statute of the 21 of James I. directing informations to be filed in the county in which the offences were committed. That statute was expounded to extend only to offences, which at the time of its passage were punishable by law. But the words of the act of congress plainly apply to all fines and forfeitures under any penal act, whenever that act might pass. They are the stronger because not many penal acts were at that time in the code.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p11">
<span class="num">11</span>
<p class="indent">In expounding this law, it deserves some consideration, that if it does not limit actions of debt for penalties, those actions might, in many cases, be brought at any distance of time. This would be utterly repugnant to the genius of our laws. In a country where not even treason can be prosecuted after a lapse of three years, it could scarcely be supposed that an individual would remain for ever liable to a pecuniary forfeiture.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p12">
<span class="num">12</span>
<p class="indent">The court is of opinion that it be certified to the circuit court for the district of Massachusetts, that the issue in law joined in this case, ought to be decided in favour of the defendant.</p>

<center><p><b>Supreme Court of United States.</b></p></center>
<center></center>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*349</span> E.J. Lee, for appellant.</p>
<p>February 6th 1805. The case was now argued by E.J. Lee, and C. Lee, for the appellant, and by Mason for the appellee.<sup>[*]</sup></p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*356</span> Marshall, C.J. delivered the opinion of the court to the following effect: Â—</p>
<p>In this case the court has attentively considered the record, proceedings, and evidence. The only equity of the complainant's bill as to Lamar &amp; Beall, arises out of the transactions between him and the defendant, Smith, and the court is of opinion that that equity is not supported; and that the material allegations of the bill as to the defendant, Smith, and which are denied by his answer, are also unsupported by the evidence. Nor are the allegations of the complainant respecting his certificate of discharge, sufficiently proved.</p>
<p>By the separation of the district of Columbia from <span class="star-pagination">*357</span> the state of Maryland, the complainant ceased to be a citizen of that state, his residence being in the city of Washington at the time of that separation.</p>
<p>As the complainant was entitled to a discharge, upon executing the deed of assignment of all his effects to the trustee appointed by the chancellor, his certificate would relate back to the date of the deed. It has been said, that the true date of that deed was the 23d of December 1800, and that the certificate of the chancellor, which states the date to be the 23d day of March 1801, is incorrect.</p>
<p>But the certificate of the chancellor, is the only evidence before the court as to that subject, and we must take it to be true. It is therefore, not material to inquire whether the inhabitants of the city of Washington, ceased to be citizens of Maryland on the 27th of February 1801, or on the first Monday of December 1800, as it is not contended that they were under the jurisdiction of Maryland so late as the 23d of March 1801.</p>
<p>The complainant, therefore, not being a citizen of Maryland at the time of executing the deed, did not bring himself within the provisions of the insolvent law, under which he claims relief.</p>
<p>I was inclined at first to think, that an account might have been directed between the complainant and the defendant, Smith, but the court is of opinion, that if he has any remedy against Smith, it is at law and not in equity. The bill must be dismissed with costs, but without prejudice.</p>

<center><h1>THE UNITED STATES<br/>
v.<br/>
FISHER et al. ASSIGNEES OF BLIGHT, A BANKRUPT.<sup>[*]</sup></h1></center>
<center><p><b>Supreme Court of United States.</b></p></center>
<center></center>
<p>Dallas (attorney of the United States for the district of Pennsylvania) for the plaintiffs in error.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*385</span> MARSHALL, Ch. J. delivered the opinion of the court.</p>
<p>The question in this case is, whether the United States, as holders of a protested bill of exchange, which has been negotiated in the ordinary course of trade, are entitled to be preferred to the general creditors, where the debtor becomes bankrupt?</p>
<p>The claim to this preference is founded on the 5th section of the act, entitled "an act to provide more effectually "for the settlement of accounts between the "United States, and receivers of public money," vol. 3, p. 423. The section is in these words, "and be it further "enacted that where any revenue officer, or other "person, hereafter becoming indebted to the United States, "by bond or otherwise, shall become insolvent, or where "the estate of any deceased debtor, in the hands of executors "or administrators, shall be insufficient to pay all "the debts due from the deceased, the debt due to the "United States shall be first satisfied; and the priority "hereby established, shall be deemed to extend, as well "to cases in which a debtor, not having sufficient property "to pay all his debts, shall make a voluntary assignment "thereof, or in which the estate and effects of an absconding, "concealed, or absent debtor, shall be attached by "process of law, as to cases in which an act of legal bankruptcy "shall be committed.</p>
<p>That these words, taken in their natural and usual sense, would embrace the case before the court, seems not to be controverted. "Any revenue officer, or other "person, hereafter becoming indebted to the United "States by bond or otherwise," is a description of persons, which, if neither explained nor restricted by other words or circumstances, would comprehend every debtor of the public, however his debt might have been contracted.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*386</span> But other parts of the act involve this question in much embarrassment.</p>
<p>It is undoubtedly a well established principle in the exposition of statutes, that every part is to be considered, and the intention of the legislature to be extracted from the whole. It is also true, that where great inconvenience will result from a particular construction, that construction is to be avoided, unless the meaning of the legislature be plain; in which case it must be obeyed.</p>
<p>On the abstract principles which govern courts in construing legislative acts, no difference of opinion can exist. It is only in the application of those principles that the difference discovers itself.</p>
<p>As the enacting clause in this case, would plainly give the United States the preference they claim, it is incumbent on those who oppose that preference, to shew an intent varying from that which the words import. In doing this, the whole act has been critically examined; and it has been contended with great ingenuity, that every part of it demonstrates the legislative mind to have been directed towards a class of debtors, entirely different from those who become so by drawing or indorsing bills, in the ordinary course of business.</p>
<p>The first part which has been resorted to is the title. On the influence which the title ought to have in construing the enacting clauses, much has been said; and yet it is not easy to discern the point of difference between the opposing counsel in this respect. Neither party contends that the title of an act can controul plain words in the body of the statute; and neither denies that, taken with other parts, it may assist in removing ambiguities. Where the intent is plain, nothing is left to construction. Where the mind labours to discover the design of the legislature, it seizes every thing from which aid can be derived; and in such case the title claims a degree of notice, and will have its due share of consideration.</p>
<p>The title of the act is unquestionably limited to "receivers <span class="star-pagination">*387</span> "of public money;" a term which undoubtedly excludes the defendants in the present case.</p>
<p>The counsel for the defendants have also completely succeeded in demonstrating that the four first sections of this act, relate only to particular classes of debtors, among whom the drawer and indorsor of a protested bill of exchange, would not be comprehended. Wherever general words have been used in these sections, they are restrained by the subject to which they relate, and by other words frequently in the same sentence, to particular objects, so as to make it apparent that they were employed by the legislature in a limited sense. Hence it has been argued with great strength of reasoning, that the same restricted interpretation ought to be given to the fifth section likewise.</p>
<p>If the same reason for that interpretation exists; if the words of the act generally, or the particular provisions of this section, afford the same reason for limiting its operation which is afforded with respect to those which precede it, then its operation must be limited to the same objects.</p>
<p>The 5th section relates entirely to the priority claimed by the United States, in the payment of debts.</p>
<p>On the phraseology of this act it has been observed, that there is a circuity of expression, which would not have been used if the intention of the legislature had been to establish its priority in all cases whatever. Instead of saying "any revenue officer or other person hereafter becoming indebted to the United States," the natural mode of expressing such an intent would have been "any person indebted to the United States;" and hence it has been inferred that debtors of a particular description only were in the mind of the legislature.</p>
<p>It is true the mode of expression which has been suggested, is at least as appropriate as that which has been used; but between the two there is no difference of meaning; and it cannot be pretended that the natural sense of words is to be disregarded, because that which they import might have been better, or more directly expressed.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*388</span> As a branch of this argument, it has also been said that the description commences with the very words which are used in the beginning of the first section; and from that circumstance it has been inferred, that the same class of cases was still in view. The commencing words of each section are "Any revenue officer or other "person." But the argument drawn from this source, if the subject be pursued further, seems to operate against the defendants. In the first section the words are, "Any revenue officer or other person accountable for public money." With this expression completely in view, and having used it in part, the description would probably have been adopted throughout, had it been the intention of the legislature to describe the same class of debtors. But it is immediately dropped, and more comprehensive words are employed. For persons "accountable for public money," persons "hereafter becoming indebted to the United States, by "bond or otherwise" are substituted. This change of language strongly implies an intent to change the object of legislation.</p>
<p>But the great effort on the part of the defendants is to connect the fifth with the four preceding sections; and to prove that as the general words in those sections are restricted to debtors of a particular description, the general words of the 5th section ought also to be restricted to debtors of the same description. On this point lies the stress of the cause.</p>
<p>In the analysis of the foregoing parts of the act, the counsel for the defendants have shewn that the general terms which have been used are uniformly connected with other words in the same section, and frequently in the same sentence, which necessarily restrict them. They have also shewn that the provisions of those parts of the act are of such a nature that the words, taking the natural import of the whole sentence together, plainly form provisions only adapted to a class of cases which those words describe if used in a limited sense.</p>
<p>It may be added that the four first sections of the act are connected with each other, and plainly contain provisions on the same subject. They all relate to the <span class="star-pagination">*389</span> mode of proceeding on suits instituted in courts, and each section regulates a particular branch of that proceeding. Where the class of suits is described in the first section, it is natural to suppose that the subsequent regulations respecting suits apply to those which have been described.</p>
<p>The first section directs that suits shall be instituted against revenue officers and other persons accountable for public money, and imposes a penalty on delinquents, where a suit shall be commenced and prosecuted to judgment.</p>
<p>The second section directs that certain testimony shall be admitted at the trial of the cause.</p>
<p>The third section prescribes the condition under which a continuance may be granted: Â— and</p>
<p>The fourth section respects the testimony which may be produced by the defendant. Â— These are all parts of the same subject; and there is strong reason, independent of the language of the act, to suppose that the provisions respecing them were designed to be co-extensive with each other.</p>
<p>But the fifth section is totally unconnected with those which precede it. Regulations of a suit in court no longer employ the mind of the legislature. The preference of the United States to other creditors, becomes the subject of legislation; and as this subject is unconnected with that which had been disposed of in the foregoing sections, so is the language employed upon it without reference to that which had been previously used. If this language was ambiguous, all the means recommended by the counsel for the defendants would be resorted to in order to remove the ambiguity. But it appears, to the majority of the court, to be too explicit to require the application of those principles which are useful in doubtful cases.</p>
<p>The mischiefs to result from the construction on which the United States insist, have been stated as strong motives for overruling that construction. That the consequences <span class="star-pagination">*390</span> are to be considered in expounding laws, where the intent is doubful, is a principle not to be controverted; but it is also true that it is a principle which must be applied with caution, and which has a degree of influence dependent on the nature of the case to which it is applied. Where rights are infringed, where fundamental principles are overthrown, where the general system of the laws is departed from, the legislative intention must be expressed with irresistible clearness to induce a court of justice to suppose a design to effect such objects. Â— But where only a political regulation is made, which is inconvenient, if the intention of the legislature be expressed in terms which are sufficiently intelligible to leave no doubt in the mind when the words are taken in their ordinary sense, it would be going a great way to say that a constrained interpretation must be put upon them, to avoid an inconvenience which ought to have been contemplated in the legislature when the act was passed, and which, in their opinion, was probably overbalanced by the particular advantages it was calculated to produce.</p>
<p>Of the latter description of inconveniences, are those occasioned by the act in question. It is for the legislature to appreciate them. They are not of such magnitude as to induce an opinion that the legislature could not intend to expose the citizens of the United States to them, when words are used which manifest that intent.</p>
<p>On this subject it is to be remarked, that no lien is created by this law. No bona fide transfer of property in the ordinary course of business is overreached. It is only a priority in payment, which, under different modifications, is a regulation in common use; and this priority is limited to a particular state of things, when the debtor is living; though it takes effect generally if he be dead.<sup>[*]</sup></p>
<p>Passing from a consideration of the act itself, and the consequences which flow from it, the counsel on each side have sought to strengthen their construction by other acts in pari materia.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*391</span> The act of the 3d of March, 1797, has been supposed to be a continuation of legislative proceeding on the subject which was commenced on the third of March, 1795, (vol. 3, p. 225.) by the act, "for the more effectual recovery of debts due from individuals to the United States," which relates exclusively to the receivers of public money.</p>
<p>Admitting the opinion, that the act of 1797 was particularly designed to supply the defects of that of 1795, to be correct, it does not seem to follow, that a substantive and independent section, having no connection with the provisions made in 1795, should be restricted by it.</p>
<p>The act of 1795 contains nothing relative to the priority of the United States, and therefore will not explain the 5th section of the act of 1797, which relates exclusively to that subject. But the act of 1797, neither in its title nor its enacting clauses, contains any words of reference to the act of 1795. The words which are supposed to imply this reference are, "to provide more effectually." Â— But these words have relation to the existing state of the law, on all the subjects to which the act of 1797 relates, not to those alone which are comprehended in the act of 1795. The title of the act of 1795 is also, "for the more effectual recovery of debts," and consequently refers to certain pre-existing laws. The act of 1797, therefore, may be supposed to have in view the act of 1795, when providing for the objects contemplated in that act; but must be supposed to have other acts in view, when providing for objects not contemplated in that act.</p>
<p>As, therefore, the act of 1795 contains nothing respecting the priority of the United States, but is limited to provisions respecting suits in court, the act of 1797 may be considered in connection with that act while on the subject of suits in court; but when on the subject of preference, must be considered in connection with acts which relate to the preference of the United States.</p>
<p>The first act on this subject passed on the 31st of July, 1789, Â§ 21, and gave the United States a preference only in the case of bonds for duties.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*392</span> On the 4th of August, 1790, vol. 1, p. 221, an act was passed on the same subject with that of 1789, which repeals all former acts, and re-enacts, in substance, the 21st section, relative to the priority of the United States.</p>
<p>On the 2d of May, 1792, vol. 2, p. 78, the priority previously given to the United States is transferred to the sureties on duty bonds who shall themselves pay the debt; and the cases of insolvency, in which this priority is to take place, are explained to comprehend the case of a voluntary assignment, and the attached effects of an absconding, concealed, or absent debtor.</p>
<p>Such was the title of the United States, to a preference in the payment of debts previous to the passage of the act of 1797. It was limited to bonds for the payment of duties on imported goods, and on the tonnage of vessels. An internal revenue had been established, and extensive transactions had taken place; in the course of which, many persons had necessarily become indebted to the United States. But no attempt to give them a preference in the collection of such debts had been made.</p>
<p>This subject is taken up in the 6th section of the act of 1797. The term "revenue officer," which is used in that act, would certainly comprehend any persons employed in the collection of the internal revenue; yet it may be well doubted whether those persons are contemplated in the foregoing sections of the act. They relate to a suit in court, and are perhaps restricted to those receivers of public money who have accounts on the books of the treasury. The head of the department in each state most probably accounts with the treasury, and the sub-collectors account with him.</p>
<p>If this be correct, a class of debtors would be introduced into the 5th section by the term "revenue officer," who are indeed within the title but not within the preceding enacting clauses of the law.</p>
<p>But passing over this term, the succeeding words seem, to the majority of the court, certainly to produce this effect. They are "or other person hereafter becoming "indebted to the United States, by bond or "otherwise," If this section was designed to place <span class="star-pagination">*393</span> the collection of the internal revenue on the same footing of security with the external revenue, as has been argued by one of the counsel for the defendants, a design so reasonable that it would naturally be attributed to the legislature, then the debtors for excise duties would be comprehended within it; yet those debtors cannot be brought within the title, or the previous enacting clauses of the bill.</p>
<p>The 5th sec. then would introduce a new class of debtors, and if it does so in any case, the act furnishes no principle which shall restrain the words of that section to every case to which they apply.</p>
<p>Three acts of congress have passed, subsequent to that under particular consideration, which have been supposed to bear upon the case.</p>
<p>The first passed on the 11th of July 1798, and is entitled "an act to regulate and fix the compensation of the "officers employed in collecting the internal revenues of "the United States, and to insure more effectually the settlement "of their accounts." The 13th section of this act (vol. 4, p. 196) refers expressly to the provisions of the act of March 1797, on the subject of suits to be instituted on the bonds given by the officers collecting the internal revenue, and shows conclusively that in the opinion of the legislature the four first sections of that act did not extend to the case of those officers; consequently, if the 5th section extends to them, it introduces a class of debtors distinct from those contemplated in the clauses which respect suits in court. The 15th section of this act takes up the subject which is supposed to be contemplated by the 5th section of the act of 1797, and declares the debt due from these revenue officers to the United States to be a lien on their real estates, and on the real estates of their sureties from the institution of suit thereon. It can scarcely be supposed that the legislature would have given a lien on the real estate without providing for a preference out of the personal estate, especially where there was no real estate, unless that preference was understood to be secured by a previous law.</p>
<p>The same observation applies to a subsequent act of the same session for laying a direct tax. A lien is reserved <span class="star-pagination">*394</span> on the real estate of the collector, without mentioning any claim to preference out of his personal estate.</p>
<p>The last law which contains any provision on the subject of preference passed on the 2d of March 1799. The 65th section of that act has been considered as repealing the 5th section of the act of 1797, or of manifesting the limited sense in which it is to be understood.</p>
<p>It must be admitted that this section involves the subject in additional perplexity; but it is the opinion of the court, that on fair construction, it can apply only to bonds taken for those duties on imports and tonnage, which are the subject of the act.</p>
<p>From the first law passed on this subject, every act respecting the collection of those duties, had contained a section giving a preference to the United States, in case of the insolvency of the collectors of them.</p>
<p>The act of 1797, if construed as the United States would construe it, would extend to those collectors if there was no other provision in any other act giving a priority to the United States in these cases. As there was such a previous act, it might be supposed that its repeal by a subsequent law, would create a doubt whether the act of 1797 would comprehend the case, and therefore from abundant caution it might be deemed necessary still to retain the section in the new act respecting those duties. The general repealing clause of the act of 1799 cannot be construed to repeal the act of 1797, unless it provides for the cases to which that act extends.</p>
<p>It has also been argued that the bankrupt law itself affords ground for the opinion that the United States do not claim a general preference. (vol. 5, p. 82.) The words of the 62d section of that law apply to debts generally as secured by prior acts. But as that section was not upon the subject of preference, but was merely designed to retain the right of the United States in their existing situation, whatever that situation might be, the question may well be supposed not to have been investigated at that time, and the expressions of the section were probably not considered with a view to any influence they might have on those rights.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*395</span> After maturely considering this doubtful statute, and comparing it with other acts in pari materia, it is the opinion of the majority of the court, that the preference given to the United States by the 5th section is not confined to revenue officers and persons accountable for public money, but extends to debtors generally.</p>
<p>Supposing this distinction not to exist, it is contended that this priority of the United States cannot take effect in any case where suit has not been instituted; and in support of this opinion several decisions of the English judges with respect to the prerogative of the crown have been quoted.</p>
<p>To this argument the express words of the act of congress seem to be opposed. The legislature has declared the time when this priority shall have its commencement; and the court think those words conclusive on the point. The cases certainly shew that a bona fide alienation of property before the right of priority attaches will be good, but that does not affect the present case. From the decisions on this subject a very ingenious argument was drawn by the counsel who made this point. The bankrupt law, he says, does not bind the king because he is not named in it; yet it has been adjudged that the effects of a bankrupt are placed beyond the reach of the king by the assignment made under that law, unless they shall have been previously bound. He argues, that according to the understanding of the legislature, as proved by their acts relative to insolvent debtors, and according to the decisions in some of the inferior courts, the bankrupt law would not bind the United States although the 62d section had not been inserted. That section therefore is only an expression of what would be law without it, and consequently is an immaterial section: as the king, though not bound by the bankrupt law, is bound by the assignment made under it; so, he contended, that the United States, though not bound by the law, are bound by the assignment.</p>
<p>But the assignment is made under, and by the direction of the law; and a proviso that nothing contained in the law shall affect the right of preference claimed by the United States is equivalent to a proviso that the assignment shall not affect the right of preference claimed by the United States.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*396</span> If the act has attempted to give the United States a preference in the case before the court, it remains to inquire whether the constitution obstructs its operation.</p>
<p>To the general observations made on this subject, it will only be observed, that as the court can never be unmindful of the solemn duty imposed on the judicial department when a claim is supported by an act which conflicts with the constitution, so the court can never be unmindful of its duty to obey laws which are authorised by that instrument.</p>
<p>In the case at bar, the preference claimed by the United States is not prohibited; but it has been truly said that under a constitution conferring specific powers, the power contended for must be granted, or it cannot be exercised.</p>
<p>It is claimed under the authority to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper to carry into execution the powers vested by the constitution in the government of the United States, or in any department or officer thereof.</p>
<p>In construing this clause it would be incorrect and would produce endless difficulties, if the opinion should be maintained that no law was authorised which was not indispensably necessary to give effect to a specified power.</p>
<p>Where various systems might be adopted for that purpose it might be said with respect to each, that it was not necessary because the end might be obtained by other means. Congress must possess the choice of means, and must be empowered to use any means which are in fact conducive to the exercise of a power granted by the constitution.</p>
<p>The government is to pay the debt of the union, and must be authorised to use the means which appear to itself most eligible to effect that object. It has consequently a right to make remittances by bills or otherwise, and to take those precautions which will render the transaction safe.</p>
<p>This claim of priority on the part of the United States <span class="star-pagination">*397</span> will, it has been said, interfere with the right of the state sovereignties respecting the dignity of debts, and will defeat the measures they have a right to adopt to secure themselves against delinquencies on the part of their own revenue officers.</p>
<p>But this is an objection to the constitution itself. The mischief suggested, so far as it can really happen, is the necessary consequence of the supremacy of the laws of the United States on all subjects to which the legislative power of congress extends.</p>
<p>As the opinion given in the court below was that the plaintiffs did not maintain their action on the whole testimony exhibited, it is necessary to examine that testimony.</p>
<p>It appears that the plaintiffs have proceeded on the transcripts from the books of the treasury, under the idea that this suit is maintainable under the act of 1797. The court does not mean to sanction that opinion; but, as no objection was taken to the testimony, it is understood to have been admitted. It is also understood that there is no question to be made respecting notice; but that the existence of the debt is admitted, and the right of the United States to priority of payment is the only real point in the cause.</p>
<p>The majority of this court is of opinion that the United States are entitled to that priority, and therefore the judgment of the circuit court is to be reversed, and the cause to be remanded for further proceedings.</p>
<p>Judgment reversed.</p>
<p>WASHINGTON, J.</p>
<p>Although I take no part in the decision of this cause, I feel myself justified by the importance of the question in declaring the reasons which induced the circuit court of Pennsylvania to pronounce the opinion which is to be re-examined here.</p>
<p>In any instance where I am so unfortunate as to differ with this court, I cannot fail to doubt the correctness of my own opinion. But if I cannot feel convinced of the <span class="star-pagination">*398</span> error, I owe it in some measure to myself and to those who may be injured by the expense and delay to which they have been exposed to shew at least that the opinion was not hastily or inconsiderately given.</p>
<p>The question is, have the United States a right in all cases whatever to claim a preference of other creditors in the payment of debts. At the circuit court the counsel for the United States disclaimed all idea of founding this right upon prerogative principles, and yet, if I am not greatly mistaken, the doctrine contended for places this right upon ground at least as broad as would have been asserted in an English court.</p>
<p>The whole question must turn upon the construction of acts of congress, and particularly that of the 3d of March 1797. The title of the law is "an act to provide more effectually for the settlement of accounts between the United States and receivers of public money."</p>
<p>The first section describes more specially the persons who are the objects of the law; points out the particular officer whose duty it shall be to institute suits against those public delinquents thus marked out; declares the rate of interest to be recovered upon balances due to the United States, and imposes a forfeiture of commissions on the delinquent.</p>
<p>The 2d section defines the kind of evidence to be admitted on the part of the United States, in the trial of suits in all cases of delinquency.</p>
<p>The 3d section gives to the United States in such actions, a preference of all other suitors in court, by directing the trial of such causes to take place at the return term upon motion, unless the defendant will make oath that he is entitled to credits which have been submitted to the consideration of the accounting officers of the treasury, and rejected.</p>
<p>The 4th section takes up the case of the defendant, and declares under what circumstances he shall be entitled to the benefit of off-sets.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*399</span> The 5th section brings us to an important part of the trial, and furnishes a rule to govern the court in the judgment it is to render, in cases where the claim of the United States might, by reason of the insolvency of the debtor, go unsatisfied, unless preferred to that of a private citizen.</p>
<p>The 6th section is general in its terms, and relates to executions where the defendant or his property is to be found in any district other than that in which the judgment was rendered.</p>
<p>This is a concise view of the different parts of this act, and I shall now examine more particularly the expressions of the 5th section, taken in connection with those which precede it.</p>
<p>The words are "that where any revenue officer or other person hereafter becoming indebted to the United States by bond or otherwise, shall become insolvent, the debt due to the United States shall be first satisfied," &amp;c.</p>
<p>It is conceded that the words "or other person" are broad enough to comprehend every possible case of debts due to the United States, and therefore a literal interpretation is contended for by those who advocate the interest of the United States. On the other side, a limitation of those expressions is said to be more consonant with the obvious meaning of the legislature, which contemplates those debtors only who are accountable for public money.</p>
<p>Where a law is plain and unambiguous, whether it be expressed in general or limited terms, the legislature should be intended to mean what they have plainly expressed, and consequently no room is left for construction. But if, from a view of the whole law, or from other laws in pari materia, the evident intention is different from the literal import of the terms employed to express it in a particular part of the law, that intention should prevail, for that in fact is the will of the legislature.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*400</span> If a section be introduced which is a stranger to and unconnected with the purview of the act, it must nevertheless take effect according to its obvious meaning, independent of all influence from other parts of the law. Nay, if it be a part of the same subject, and either enlarges or restrains the expressions used in other parts of the same act, it must be interpreted according to the import of the words used, if nothing can be gathered from such other parts of the law to change the meaning. But if in this latter case, general words are used which import more than seems to have been within the purview of the law, or of the other parts of the law, and those expressions can be restrained by others used in the same law, or in any other upon the same subject, they ought in my opinion to be restrained.</p>
<p>So if the literal expressions of the law would lead to absurd, unjust or inconvenient consequences, such a construction should be given as to avoid such consequences, if, from the whole purview of the law, and giving effect to the words used, it may fairly be done.</p>
<p>These rules are not merely artificial; they are as clearly founded in plain sense, as they are certainly warranted by the principles of common law.</p>
<p>The subject intended to be legislated upon is sometimes stated in a preamble, sometimes in the title to the law, and is sometimes, I admit, mistated, or not fully stated. The preamble of an act of parliament is said to be a key to the knowledge of it, and to open the intent of the law-makers: and so I say as to the title of a law of congress, which being the deliberate act of those who make the law, is not less to be respected as an expression of their intention, than if it preceded the enacting clause in the form of a preamble. But neither the title or preamble can be resorted to for the purpose of controuling the enacting clauses, except in cases of ambiguity, or where general expressions are used inconsistent or unconnected with the scope and purview of the whole law.</p>
<p>They are to be deemed true, unless contradicted by the enacting clauses, and it is fair in the cases I have stated to argue from them.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*401</span> The object of this law then, as declared by the title, is to provide for the effectual settlement of debts due to the United States, from receivers of public money. To effect this, suits are directed, the species of evidence to support the claim on the part of the plaintiff is pointed out, and a speedy trial provided; on the part of the defendant, a limited right to oppose the claim by offsets is provided, and the claim of the United States is to have a preference of other creditors, where the debtor is unable to satisfy the whole. Here then is one entire connected subject Â— the different provisions of the law constituting the links of the same chain, the members of the same body. It will not, I presume, be denied, that the three first sections of the law apply to those only who are declared by the title to be the objects of its provisions. The 4th section is the first which uses general expressions, without a reference to those who had before been spoken of; and yet I think it will hardly be contended that this section is not closely and intimately connected with the same subject. Â— When we come to the 5th section the reference to the three first sections is again resumed, with the addition of the words "or any other person." So that instead of the words "revenue officers or other persons accountable for public money," used in the first section, this section uses the words "revenue officers or other persons indebted to the United States."</p>
<p>Now it is obvious that these expressions may have precisely the same meaning, so as to comprehend the same persons, although the latter may be construed to include persons not within the meaning of the first section. For persons accountable for public money, are also other persons than revenue officers indebted to the United States; and the latter may, by a construction conformable to the other parts of the law, mean persons accountable for public money; and by an intended construction, they may comprehend others, who in no sense of the expressions used, can be said to be accountable for public money.</p>
<p>It is given to be inquired, is the court bound by any known rules of law to give to the words thus used in the 5th section a meaning extensive enough to comprehend persons never contemplated by the title of the law, and most <span class="star-pagination">*402</span> sedulously excluded by the three first sections? Does justice to the public, or convenience to individuals demand it? Is such a construction necessary in order to give effect to any one expression used by the legislature?</p>
<p>Shall we violate the manifest intention of the legislature, if we stop short of the point to which we are invited to go in the construction of this section?</p>
<p>To all these questions I think myself warranted in answering in the negative.</p>
<p>As to the first. Do the principles of equity, or of strict justice discriminate between individuals standing in equali jure and claiming debts of equal dignity?</p>
<p>The nature of the debt, may well warrant a discrimination; but not so, if the privilege be merely of a personal nature. The sovereign may in the exercise of his powers secure to himself this exclusive privilege of being preferred to the citizens, but this is no evidence that the claim is sanctioned by the principles of immutable justice. If this right is asserted, individuals must submit; but I do not find it in my conscience to go further in advancement of the claim, than the words of the law fairly interpreted, in relation to the whole law, compel me. But I do not think that congress meant to exercise their power to the extent contended for. First, because in every other section of the law they have declared a different intent; and secondly, because it would not only be productive of the most cruel injustice to individuals, but would tend to destroy more than any other act I can imagine all confidence between man and man. The preference claimed is not only unequal in respect to private citizens, but is of a nature against which the most prudent man cannot guard himself. As to public officers and receivers of public money of all descriptions, they are, or may be known as such; and any person dealing with them, does it at the peril of being postponed to any debts his debtor may owe to the United States, should he become unfortunate. He acts with his eyes open, and has it in his power to calculate the risk he is willing to run.</p>
<p>But if this preference exists in every possible case of contracts between the United States and an individual, <span class="star-pagination">*403</span> there is no means by which any man can be apprized of his danger, in dealing with the same person.</p>
<p>2. Is this broad construction necessary in order to give effect to the expressions of the law? I have endeavoured to shew that all accountable agents are other persons than revenue officers indebted to the United States. The words then "other persons" are satisfied by comprehending all those persons, to whom the first section extends.</p>
<p>3. Is this construction rendered necessary to fulfil the manifest intent of the legislature? So far from it, that to my mind, it is in direct opposition to an intention plainly expressed by all the other parts of the law. To prove this I again refer to the title of the law; to the three first sections, which are in strict conformity with it, and that too by express words; and to the fourth section, which is so plainly a part of the same subject, that it cannot be construed to go farther than those which precede it. Is the fifth section a stranger to the others; unnaturally placed there without having a connection with the other sections?</p>
<p>If this be the case, I have already admitted rules of construction, strong enough to condemn the opinion I hold. But let us examine this point.</p>
<p>The object of the four first sections is to enforce by suit, where necessary, the payment of debts due to the United States from a particular class of debtors. It points out the officer who is to order the suit, declares at what term the cause shall be tried, lays down rules of evidence to be regarded in support of the action, extends to the defendant the benefit of making offsets under certain qualifications, and then most naturally, as I conceive, comes the fifth section, relating to the judgment which the court is to render in case a contest should ensue between the United States and individual creditors on account of inability in the debtor to satisfy the whole. What if an individual creditor should attach the property of the debtor before the United States had taken steps to recover their debt? Or if the debtor should assign away his property, or it should be claimed <span class="star-pagination">*404</span> by assignees under a commission of bankruptcy; or the defendant being an executor, should plead fully administered except so much as would be sufficient to satisfy judgments, bond debts, or other debts superior in dignity to that of the United States? This section establishes a plain rule by which the court must proceed in rendering its judgment whenever those cases occur. Â— What would have signified all the other provisions of the law, unless a rule of decision had been prescribed in cases where otherwise the United States might never obtain the fruit of those steps which their officers were pursuing?</p>
<p>Can a section in a law which professes to afford a remedy in a particular case by process of law, be said not to belong to the law, when it leads to the point of a judgment, which is the consummation of the proceedings in the case? I think not; and therefore I cannot acquiesce in the opinion that the 5th section is unconnected with the other parts of the law.</p>
<p>I have before observed that the 4th section is the first which uses general expressions, without reference to those which had before been particularly mentioned; but that when we come to the 5th section the reference is again taken up, with the addition of those words which produce the difficulty of the case.</p>
<p>Now I ask in the first place, what necessity was there for departing from the mode of expression used in the 4th section, which for the first time is general, without particular reference to any of the persons before described. Would it not have been as well in the 5th as in the 4th section, to say "that where any individual becoming "indebted to the United States, shall become "insolvent," &amp;c. What reason can be assigned for the specification of revenue officers, one class of persons mentioned expressly in the 1st section, intended in the 2d and 3d by plain words of reference, and clearly meant in the 4th, when it must be admitted that the words used in the 4th section, or the words "other per sons," in the 5th would have comprehended revenue officers if they were broad enough to include every description of persons indebted to the United States. <span class="star-pagination">*405</span> Unless they are construed to limit and restrain the generality of the words "other persons," they are absolutely without any use or meaning whatever. If the preceding sections had applied only to revenue officers, then from necessity we must have construed the words "other persons," as broad as their natural import would warrant, because otherwise, they would have been nugatory, and we would have found no rule in the law itself, by which to limit the generality of the expression.</p>
<p>But when the law professes in its title to relate to all accountable agents besides revenue officers, and the first section specifies amongst these agents, "revenue officers," we have a rule by which to restrain the sweeping expressions in the 5th section, viz. "or other person accountable, or indebted as aforesaid." This construction renders the law uniform throughout, and consistent with what it professes in every other section.</p>
<p>2d. In confirmation of this construction, the 62d section of the bankrupt law does, in my opinion, deserve attention. If the United States were, at the time that law passed, entitled to a preference in every possible case, by virtue of the general expressions in the law I have just been considering, what necessity was there for limiting the saving of the right of preference to debts due to the United States, "as secured or provided by any law heretofore passed." This mode of expression leads me to conclude that the legislature supposed there were some cases where this preference had not been provided for by law. If not, it would certainly have been sufficient to declare, that the bankrupt law should not extend to or affect the right of prefÃ©rence to prior satisfaction of debts due the United States.</p>

<center><h1>GRAVES AND BARNEWALL<br/>
v.<br/>
BOSTON MARINE INSURANCE COMPANY.</h1></center>
<center><p><b>Supreme Court of United States.</b></p></center>
<center></center>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*425</span> This cause was argued at February term 1804, by Stockton, of New-Jersey, and Martin, of Maryland for the appellants, and by Harper, of Maryland, and Key, of the district of Columbia, for the appellees; and at this term by Stockton, for the appellants, and Harper and Ingersoll, of Pennsylvania, for the appellees.</p>
<p>Stockton, for appellants, made three points: &amp;mdash.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*438</span> MARSHALL, Ch. J. delivered the opinion of the court.</p>
<p>The points made by the plaintiffs in this case, are,</p>
<p>1st. That the policy does really insure their joint property on board the ship Northern Liberties, so far as the same was at the time uncovered by prior assurances.</p>
<p>2d. That if the property be not insured at law, yet it was intended to be insured, and this court will relieve against the mistake in the agreement.</p>
<p>1st. That the policy does really insure the joint property of Graves and Barnewall.</p>
<p>The words are "the president and directors of the Boston Marine Insurance Company, do by these presents cause John Boonen Graves to be assured 10,000 dollars, on property on board the ship Northern Liberties, as property may appear."</p>
<p>These words, it is contended by the counsel for the plaintiffs, insure the joint property of Graves and Barnewall, so as to cover the interest of each.</p>
<p>The operation of the words themselves taken in their ordinary sense, would certainly not extend beyond the interest held by Graves in the cargo. The words "as property <span class="star-pagination">*439</span> may appear," seem to restrict the general terms of the policy to the interest of the person named in it. Admitting this to be true, it is still contended that the interest of each partner, in the whole partnership-stock is an insurable interest; and as it was obviously the intention of Graves to insure for his partner as well as for himself, the policy ought to receive a construction which will effect this intent. The reasoning in support of the power of each partner to insure the joint property is certainly strong and well founded. But the doubt in this case, is not whether Graves could have insured the interest of his partner, but whether he has insured it.</p>
<p>It is true that Barnewall need not have been named in the policy; but the contract ought to have been so expressed (since it is an open policy,) as to shew that the interest of some other person than Graves was secured, if such was to be the effect of the instrument.</p>
<p>It is a good general principle that written agreements ought to be expounded by themselves. But if the same words are to be considered as insuring the interest of Graves only, or the interest of Graves and Barnewall, according to extrinsic circumstances, the certainty expected from a written agreement will be very much impaired.</p>
<p>The interest of Barnewall therefore cannot be considered as insured by this policy, under the power of one partner to insure the share of his co-partner. If it is insured, it must be as the interest of Graves</p>
<p>Several cases have been stated in which Graves might sustain a loss by the loss of Barnewall's part of the cargo, and therefore it has been contended that he may be indemnified against that risk, in a policy professing to cover only his own interest.</p>
<p>The case put, is that Graves might have paid for the whole cargo, and have retained a lien upon it for his reimbursement. But in that case his interest would not be the result of his character as a partner, but would be in the nature of a mortgage. The question would not be generally whether the interest of a copartner may be said to comprehend all the partnership effects, but whether a mortgagee, or other person having a lien upon property may be said to have an interest in the whole of it. As a claim so <span class="star-pagination">*440</span> founded, would rest, not on the general principles of partnership, but on the particular circumstances of the case, those circumstances ought to be made out, in order to entitle the plaintiffs to avail themselves of the argument. Not being made out they do not belong to the case.</p>
<p>If a suit at law had been brought on this policy, it would only have been brought in the name of Graves, and he must have averred property on board the vessel. He could only have been entitled to recover to the amount of property uninsured. Would it have been sufficient under such an averment to have shewn that the interest of his partners and himself amounted to the sum he claimed, or if he had averred property in himself and another to the amount of 10,000 dollars, would such an averment have entitled him to a judgment for the whole sum. In ordinary transactions the plaintiff would certainly fail in an attempt founded on similar principles.</p>
<p>A policy though construed liberally is still a special contract, and under no rule for proceedings on a special contract, could the interest of a copartnership be given in evidence on an averment of individual interest, or an averment of the interest of a company be supported by a special contract relating in its terms to the interest of an individual.</p>
<p>But it is contended that an insurable interest is distinct from interest in the ordinary acceptation of the word; and several cases have been cited in support of this doctrine. Those cases generally appear to be answered by a distinction taken by the defendants' counsel between the interest and the power of a copartner. But the case of Page v. Fry reported in 2. Bosanquet and Pul. 240 certainly countenances the doctrine maintained by the plaintiffs, and ought to be particularly considered. B before that case is adverted to, it may be proper to mention what appeared to be the opinion of Judge Buller in the case of Perchard v. Whitmore, reported in the same book in page 155. In that case it appears to have been considered as a clear principle that if in an action on a policy, and on an averment of interest in the plaintiffs, it should appear that the plaintiffs and another were interested, the action would not be maintainable. That opinion would apply to the case at bar; but as the question <span class="star-pagination">*441</span> was not directly decided, and was the opinion of a single judge, it may be supposed to yield to the case of Page &amp; Fry, where it is said, that question came directly before the court.</p>
<p>The case of Page &amp; Fry, was an action brought by an agent on a policy signed by himself, and in the declaration he averred an interest in the whole cargo insured in Messrs. Hyde and Hobbs. It appeared in evidence, that after the purchase of the cargo, and before the insurance was made, a house by the name of Hacks had taken an interest in it, and for this variance between the averment and the proof the defendants moved for a nonsuit.</p>
<p>It is worthy of remark that no doubt was entertained of the right of the plaintiffs to recover the whole sum had the declaration stated the truth of the case. And that the counsel in support of the action did not allege that the interest of Hacks was insured as the interest of Hyde and Hobbs, or that on an averment of a particular interest a joint interest might be given in evidence; but, that the averment was immaterial under the acts of parliament, and being alleged under a scilicet would not vitiate. The invoices having been made out in the name of Hyde and Hobbs, who paid for the cargo, he also contended that the prima facie right was in them, and that Hacks had only an equitable interest.</p>
<p>The argument goes upon the admission that the variance under the circumstances which attend the case at bar would be fatal.</p>
<p>The same remark applies to the argument in support of the nonsuit.</p>
<p>This deserves consideration, since it certainly warrants an opinion that previous to that case the law was generally understood to require that the averment of interest in an action on a policy should be supported by testimony corresponding with that interest according to the general acceptation of the term.</p>
<p>Lord Eldon certainly states his opinion in favor of the action to be founded on the interest of the plaintiffs in the entirety of the cargo. But in examining that opinion <span class="star-pagination">*442</span> it does not appear to be supported by the authorities he cites, and the words he uses in the conclusion would seem to imply that, contrary to his reasoning, he paid some respect to the circumstances under which Hacks had become concerned. "I think," says his lordship, "the plaintiff "had a sufficient interest in the entirety of this cargo, notwithstanding "other persons had a beneficial interest in a "part." The word "beneficial" seems to imply something distinct from a legal interest, and to correspond with the terms equitable interest, which had been used by the plaintiffs' counsel. The opinions of justices Heath and Chambre seem to be founded on this being a valued policy, and on the plaintiff's having such an interest as would entitle him to insure under the act of parliament, and that the substance of the averment was nothing more than that the plaintiffs had an interest in the cargo which would satisfy the act. The opinion of judge Rooke is accompanied with no explanation whatever.</p>
<p>This case, even was the decision an authority, is too imperfectly reported to be permitted to overthrow a system which was previously established.</p>
<p>It is the opinion of the court that on the legal construction of this policy John Boonen Graves is insured to the extent of his own interest in the cargo, but that the interest of his copartner is not insured.</p>
<p>Were it otherwise, the remedy would be, complete at law, and of consequence the plaintiffs could not maintain their bill in a court of equity.</p>
<p>2dly. It remains to inquire whether, under the circumstances of the case, a court of equity will relieve the plaintiffs against the mistake alleged to exist in the contract, and extend the insurance to the whole partnership interest.</p>
<p>That Graves intended to insure the whole is proved in a manner which is perfectly satisfactory.</p>
<p>That the company believed themselves to be insuring the property of Graves only is probable. Certainly such is the evidence in the cause. There is no ground for imputing to the company a knowledge that the policy did not correspond with the intentions of the insured.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*443</span> If then the relief which they ask should be granted to the plaintiffs, it must be on the principle that the information laid before the insurance company was sufficient to apprise them of the fact, and to require that, on the principles of good faith, they should suggest to the agent of the plaintiffs the departure of their policy from the ancient form.</p>
<p>This information is in writing and is contained in the letter of the 5th of May, and in the representation of the risk which accompanied it.</p>
<p>The letter must be considered as having been seen by the officers of the company; but as it was shewn not for the purpose of commencing a contract but of inquiring into the terms on which a contract might probably be made, it is reasonable to suppose that the nature of the risk was the only subject of consideration, and that the question whether the property belonged to one or more persons never occurred. A month elapsed before a second application was made, and as the description of the risk was again laid before the president, it could not be required from him to retain in his mind a circumstance casually suggested in a letter seen so long before, to which circumstance there was nothing to direct his particular attention.</p>
<p>It is then on the representation of the risk and on the verbal communications of Andrew Sigourney, that the case must depend.</p>
<p>The representation contains an averment that "the "ship and cargo really and truly belong to citizens of "the United States." But as only a small part of the cargo was insured by the Boston company, this averment contains no information that any other than John Boonen Graves was interested in the particular policy then to be entered into.</p>
<p>In the letter there is another expression which has been much relied on. It is "on this vessel's cargo we "want insurance." This expression has been considered as sufficiently indicating that the application was made in behalf of more than one person; and this expression has produced the principal difficulty of the case; <span class="star-pagination">*444</span> but on reflection it has been thought too ambiguous to authorise a change in the legal import of a written contract.</p>
<p>The description obviously relates to the whole cargo; but the application for insurance was only for a part of it. If that application was made in the name of Graves only, it was no unreasonable supposition that the other parties concerned might be separately insured, and that the policy then required was designed to cover Graves only. That the application was so made must be inferred from the circumstance that the policy was so framed at a time when there could be no motive for varying it from the insurance applied for; and that Sigourney does not allege himself to have made any communications to the president indicating a wish to insure others than Graves.</p>
<p>These grounds are too equivocal to warrant the court in varying a written contract in a case attended with the circumstances which appear in the present.</p>
<p>The policy was in the possession of the agent for the plaintiffs, and ought to have been understood by him before it was executed; he retained it in his possession for several months before a mistake was alleged. Under such circumstances the information given to the insurance company ought to be very clear to justify a court of equity in conforming the policy to the intention of one of the parties, which was not communicated to the other till the loss had happened.</p>
<p>Under the circumstances of the case a court of equity cannot relieve against the mistake which has been committed; and as the remedy of the plaintiff, Graves, on the policy to the extent of his interest is complete at law, the decree of the circuit court dismissing his bill must be affirmed.</p>
<p>Judgment affirmed.</p>

<p>E.J. Lee, for plaintiffs.</p>
<p>C. Lee, contra.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*452</span> Marshall, Ch. J. delivered the opinion of the court.</p>
<p>The question in this case is whether the plaintiffs, as residents of the district of Columbia, can maintain an action in the circuit court of the United States for the district of Virginia.</p>
<p>This depends on the act of congress describing the jurisdiction of that court. That act gives jurisdiction to the circuit courts in cases between a citizen of the state in which the suit is brought, and a citizen of another state. To support the jurisdiction in this case therefore it must appear that Columbia is a state.</p>
<p>On the part of the plaintiffs it has been urged that Columbia is a distinct political society; and is therefore "a "state" according to the definitions of writers on general law.</p>
<p>This is true. But as the act of congress obviously uses the word "state" in reference to that term as used in the constitution, it becomes necessary to inquire whether Columbia is a state in the sense of that instrument. The result of that examination is a conviction that the members of the American confederacy only are the states contemplated in the constitution.</p>
<p>The house of representatives is to be composed of members chosen by the people of the several states; and each state shall have at least one representative.</p>
<p>The senate of the United States shall be composed of two senators from each state.</p>
<p>Each state shall appoint, for the election of the executive, a number of electors equal to its whole number of senators and representatives.</p>
<p>These clauses show that the word state is used in the constitution as designating a member of the union, and excludes <span class="star-pagination">*453</span> from the term the signification attached to it by writers on the law of nations. When the same term which has been used plainly in this limited sense in the articles respecting the legislative and executive departments, is also employed in that which respects the judicial department, it must be understood as retaining the sense originally given to it.</p>
<p>Other passages from the constitution have been cited by the plaintiffs to show that the term state is sometimes used in its more enlarged sense. But on examining the passages quoted, they do not prove what was to be shown by them.</p>
<p>It is true that as citizens of the United states, and of that particular district which is subject to the jurisdiction of congress, it is extraordinary that the courts of the United States, which are open to aliens, and to the citizens of every state in the union, should be closed upon them. Â— But this is a subject for legislative not for judicial consideration.</p>
<p>The opinion to be certified to the circuit court is that that court has no jurisdiction in the case.</p>

<p><span class="star-pagination">*10</span> Dallas, for the plaintiff.</p>
<p>M`Kean, (Attorney general of Pennsylvania) contra.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*65</span> MARSHALL, Ch. J. delivered the opinion of the court as follows:</p>
<p>The questions which occurred in this case, in the circuit court of Pennsylvania, and on which the opinion of this court is required, grow out of the act passed by the legislature of that state, entitled "an act for the sale of the vacant lands within this commonwealth."</p>
<p>The 9th section of that act, on which the case principally depends, is in these words, "and be it further enacted," &amp;c.</p>
<p>The questions to be considered, relate particularly to the proviso of this section; but to construe that correctly, it will be necessary to understand the enacting clause, which states what is to be performed by the purchaser of a warrant, before the title to the lands described therein, shall vest in him.</p>
<p>Two classes of purchasers are contemplated.</p>
<p>The one has already performed every condition of the sale, and is about to pay the consideration money; the other pays the consideration money in the first instance, and is afterwards to perform the conditions. They are both described in the same sentence, and from each, an actual settlement is required as indispensable to the completion of the title.</p>
<p>In describing this actual settlement, it is declared that it shall be made, in the case of a warrant previously granted, within two years next after the date of such warrant, "by clearing, fencing, and cultivating, at least, two acres for every hundred acres contained in one survey, erecting thereon, a messuage for the habitation of man, and residing, or causing a family to reside thereon, for the space of five years next following his first settling of the same, if he or she shall so long live."</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*66</span> The manifest impossibility of completing a residence of five years, within the space of two years, would lead to an opinion, that the part of the description relative to residence, applied to those only who had performed the condition before the payment of the purchase money; and not to those who were to perform it afterwards. But there are subsequent parts of the act which will not admit of this construction, and, consequently, residence is a condition required from the person who settles under a warrant, as well as from one who entitles himself to a warrant by his settlement.</p>
<p>The law requiring two repugnant and incompatible things, is incapable of receiving a literal construction, and must sustain some change of language to be rendered intelligible. This change, however, ought to be as small as possible, and with a view to the sense of the legislature, as manifested by themselves. The reading suggested by the counsel for the plaintiff, appears to be most reasonable, and to comport best with the general language of the section, and with the nature of the subject. It is by changing the participle into the future tense of the verb, and instead of, "and residing, or causing a family to reside there," and shall reside, &amp;c. The effect of this correction of language, will be to destroy the repugnancy which exists in the act as it stands, and to reconcile this part of the sentence to that which immediately follows, and which absolutely demonstrates that in the view of the legislature, the settlement and the residence consequent thereon, were distinct parts of the condition; the settlement to be made within the space of two years from the date of the warrant, and the residence in five years from the commencement of the settlement.</p>
<p>This construction is the more necessary, because the very words, "such actual settlement and residence," which prove, that residence is required from the warrantee, prove also, that settlement and residence are, in contemplation of the law, distinct operations. In the nature of things, and from the usual import of words, they are also distinct. To make a <span class="star-pagination">*67</span> settlement, no more requires a residence of five, than a residence of five hundred years: and of consequence, it is much more reasonable to understand the legislature as requiring the residence for that term, in addition to a settlement, than as declaring it to be a component part of a settlement.</p>
<p>The meaning of the terms settlement and residence being understood, the court will proceed to consider the proviso.</p>
<p>That part of the act treats of an actual settler, (under which term is intended, as well the person who makes his settlement the foundation of his claim to a warrant, as a warrantee who had made an actual settlement in performance of the conditions annexed to his purchase) and of "any grantee in any such original or succeeding warrant;" who must be considered as contradistinguished from one who had made an actual settlement. Persons thus distinctly circumstanced, are brought together in the same sentence, and terms are used appropriate to the situation of each, but not applicable to both. Thus, the idea of "an actual settler," "prevented from making an actual settlement," and after "being driven therefrom," "persisting in his endeavours," to make it, would be absurd. To apply to each class of purchasers, all parts of the proviso would involve a contradiction in terms. Under such circumstances, the plain and natural mode of construing the act, is to apply the provisions distributively to the description of persons to whom they are adapted, reddendo singula singulis. The proviso then would read thus, "Provided always, nevertheless, that if any such actual settler shall be driven from his settlement, by force of arms of the enemies of the United States; or any grantee. in any such original or succeeding warrant, shall, by force of arms of the enemies of the United States, be prevented from making such actual settlement, and shall persist in his endeavours, to make such actual settlement as aforesaid, then, in either case, he and his heirs shall be entitled to have and to hold the said lands, in the <span class="star-pagination">*68</span> same manner, as if the actual settlement had been made and continued."</p>
<p>The two cases are, the actual settler, who has been driven from his settlement, and the warrantee, who has been prevented from making a settlement, but has persisted in his endeavours to make one.</p>
<p>It is perfectly clear, that in each case, the proviso substitutes something for the settlement to be made, within two years, from the date of the warrant, and for the residence to continue five years from the commencement of the settlement, both of which were required in the enacting clause.</p>
<p>What is that something?</p>
<p>The proviso answers, that in the case of an "actual settler," it is his being "driven from his settlement by force of arms of the enemies of the United States," and in case of his being a grantee of a warrant not having settled, it is "persisting in his endeavours to make such actual settlement." In neither case, is residence or persisting in his endeavours, at residence required. Yet the legislature had not forgotten, that by the enacting clause, residence was to be added to settlement; for in the same sentence, they say, that the person who comes within the proviso, shall hold the land "as if the actual settlement had been made and continued."</p>
<p>It is contended on the part of the defendant, that as the time during which persistance shall continue, is not prescribed, the person claiming the land must persist until he shall have effected both his settlement and residence, as required by the enacting clause of the act. That is, that the proviso dispenses with the time, and only with the time, during which the condition is to be performed.</p>
<p>But the words are not only inapt for the expression of such an intent; they absolutely contradict it.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*69</span> If the proviso be read, so as to be intelligible, it requires nothing from the actual settler, who has been driven from his settlement. He is not to persist in his endeavours at residence, or, in other words, to continue his settlement, but is to hold the land. From the warrantee who has been prevented from making a settlement, no endeavours at residence are required. He is to "persist in his endeavours," not to make, and to continue such actual settlement, but "to make such actual settlement as aforesaid." And if he does persist in those endeavours, he is to hold the land, "as if the actual settlement had been made and continued." The construction of the defendant would make the legislature say, in substance, that if the warrantee shall persist in endeavouring to accomplish a particular object, until he does accomplish it, he should hold the land as if he had accomplished it. But independent of the improbability, that the intention to dispense, only with the time in which the condition was to be performed, would be expressed in the language which has been noticed, there are terms used, which seem to restrict the time during which a persistance in endeavours is required. The warrantee is to persist in his endeavours, "to make such actual settlement as aforesaid." Now, "such actual settlement as aforesaid," is an actual settlement within two years from the date of the warrant. As it could only be made within two years, a persistance in endeavouring to make it, could only continue for that time.</p>
<p>If, after being prevented from making an actual settlement, and persisting in endeavours, those endeavours should be successful within the two years after which the person should be driven off, it is asked, what would be his situation?</p>
<p>The answer is a plain one. By persisting, he has become an actual settler; and the part of the proviso which applies to actual settlers, protects him.</p>
<p>If, after the two years, he should be driven off, he is still protected. The application of external violence dispenses with residence. The court feels itself bound <span class="star-pagination">*70</span> to say so, because the proviso contains a substitute, which, in such a state of things, shall be received instead of a performance of the conditions required by the enacting clause; and of that substitute, residence forms no part.</p>
<p>In a great variety of forms, and with great strength, it has been argued, that the settlement of the country was the great object of the act; and that the construction of the plaintiff would defeat that object.</p>
<p>That the exclusive object of an act to give lands to settlers, would be the settlement of a country, will be admitted; but that an act to sell lands to settlers, must have for its exclusive object, the settlement of the country, cannot be so readily conceded. In attempting to procure settlements, the treasury was certainly not forgotten. How far those two objects might be consulted, or how far the one yielded to the other, is only to be inferred from the words in which the legislative intention has been expressed. How far the legislature may have supposed the peopling of the district in question, to have been promoted by encouraging actual settlements, though a subsequent residence on them should be rendered impracticable by a foreign enemy, can only be shown by their own language. At any rate, if the legislature has used words, dispensing with residence, it is not for the court to say they could not intend it, unless there were concomitant expressions, which should explain those words in a manner different from their ordinary import. There are other considerations in favour of the construction, to which the court is inclined.</p>
<p>This is a contract; and although a state is a party. it ought to be construed according to those well established principles, which regulate contracts generally.</p>
<p>The state is in the situation of a person who holds forth to the world, the conditions on which he is willing to sell his property.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*71</span> If he should couch his propositions in such ambiguous terms, that they might be understood differently, in consequence of which, sales were to be made, and the purchase money paid, he would come with an ill grace into court, to insist on a latent and obscure meaning, which should give him back his property, and permit him to retain the purchase money. All those principles of equity, and of fair dealing, which constitute the basis of judicial proceedings, require that courts should lean against such a construction.</p>
<p>It being understood, that the opinion of the court on the two first questions, has rendered a decision of the third unnecessary, no determination respecting it has been made.</p>
<p>It is directed, that the following opinion be certified to the circuit court.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>Certificate of the Opinion.</h2>
<p>1st. That it is the opinion of this court, that under the act of the legislature of Pennsylvania, passed the 3d day of April, A.D. 1792, entitled "An act for the sale of the vacant lands within this commonwealth," the grantee, by a warrant of a tract of land lying north and west of the rivers Ohio and Alleghany and Conewango creek, who, by force of arms of the enemies of the United States, was prevented from settling and improving the said land, and from residing thereon from the 10th of April, 1793, the date of the said warrant, until the 1st of January, 1796; but who, during the said period, persisted in his endeavours to make such settlement and residence, is excused from making such actual settlement as the enacting clause of the 9th section of the said law prescribes to vest a title in the said grantee.</p>
<p>2d. That it is the opinion of this court, that a warrant for a tract of land lying north and west of the rivers Ohio and Alleghany and Conewango creek, granted in the year 1793, under and by virtue of an act of the legislature of Pennsylvania, entitled "An act for selling the vacant lands of this commonwealth," to a person, who, by force of arms of the enemies of the United States, was <span class="star-pagination">*72</span> prevented from settling and improving the said land, and from residing thereon from the date of the said warrant until the 1st of January, 1796, but who, during the said period, persisted in his endeavours to make such settlement and residence, vests in such grantee a fee simple in the said land, although, after the said prevention ceased, he did not commence, and within the space of two years thereafter, clear, fence and cultivate, at least two acres for every hundred acres contained in his survey for the said land, and erect thereon a messuage for the habitation of man, and reside, or cause a family to reside thereon, for the space of five years next following his first settling of the same; the said grantee being yet in full life.</p>
<p>JOHNSON, J.</p>
<p>I concur in the decision given by the court in this case; but there was a question suggested and commented on in the argument which has not been noticed by the court, but which appears to me to merit some consideration.</p>
<p>It was inquired by the counsel for the defendant, should the court adopt the principle, that persistance for two years is to be substituted for an actual settlement and residence, what is to be the effect of a partial prevention? Is the warrantee to be subjected to the necessity of making good his settlement, should the prevention cease or commence at any point of time during the two years without any, or under what limitation?</p>
<p>It is undoubtedly true, that any construction of a statute which will produce absurdities, or consequences in direct violation of its own provisions, is to be avoided. It were better not to depart from their literal signification than to involve consequences so inconsistent with the nature and very idea of legislation. But it does not appear to me that any embarrassment will attend the construction of this act which the court has adopted; that the case of a partial duration of the existence of the preventing cause is not within the view of the proviso; that it is not excepted from the operation of the enacting clause. It would be absurd to impose upon the warrantee the necessity of performing in a few months, perhaps at the most inconvenient season of the year, a condition for which the act proposes to hold out to him an indulgence <span class="star-pagination">*73</span> of two years; when prevented too by a cause not within his controul, and against which the state was bound to protect him. If such were the case now before the court, I should be of opinion that we must resort to general principles for a decision. With regard to the performance of conditions, it is a well known rule, that obstructions interposed by the act of God, or a public enemy, shall excuse from performance, so far as the effect of such preventing cause necessarily extends.</p>
<p>In cases of partial prevention, I should therefore be of opinion, that it would be incumbent upon the warrantee to satisfy the court that he had complied with the conditions imposed by the act, so far as he was not necessarily prevented by the public enemy.</p>
<p>It may appear singular that a deficiency, of a single day perhaps, should produce so material an alteration in the rights or situation of the warrantee. But the legislature of Pennsylvania were fully competent to make what statutory provisions they thought proper upon the subject; and the court is no further responsible for the effect of the words which they have used to express their intent, than to endeavour to give a sensible and consistent operation to them in every case that can occur.</p>

<p></p>
<h2>
<span class="star-pagination">*88</span> <i>Wednesday, February</i> 27.</h2>
<p>MARSHALL, Ch. J. delivered the opinion of the court.</p>
<p>The first point made in this case, by the attorney for the United States, is, that the deed of the 16th of January, 1799, is fraudulent as to creditors generally.</p>
<p>It is not alleged that the consideration was feigned, or that there was any secret trust between the parties. The transaction is admitted to have been, in truth, what it purports to be; but it is contended that the deed, on its face, is fraudulent as to creditors.</p>
<p>The deed is made to save Hooe harmless on account of his having become the security of Fitzgerald to the United States, and on account of notes to be indorsed by Hooe for the accommodation of Fitzgerald, in the bank of Alexandria.</p>
<p>These are purposes for which it is supposed this deed of trust could not lawfully have been executed; and the deed has been pronounced fraudulent under the statute of 13<i>th of Elizabeth.</i></p>
<p>That statute contains a proviso, that it shall not extend to conveyances made upon <i>good consideration,</i> and <i>bona</i> <span class="star-pagination">*89</span> <i>fide.</i> The goodness of the consideration, in the case at bar, has been admitted; but it is alleged that the conveyance is not <i>bona fide;</i> and for this, <i>Twyne's</i> case has been principally relied on. But in that case, the intent was believed by the court to be fraudulent, and in this case it is admitted not to have been fraudulent. It is contended, that all the circumstances from which fraud was inferred in that case, are to be found in this; but the court can find between them no trait of similitude. In <i>that</i> case the deed was of <i>all</i> the property; was <i>secret;</i> was of <i>chattels,</i> and purported to be <i>absolute,</i> yet the vendor remained in possession of them, and exercised marks of ownership over them. In <i>this</i> case the deed is of <i>part</i> of the property, is of <i>record,</i> is of <i>lands,</i> and purports to be a conveyance which, according to its legal operation, leaves the property conveyed in possession of the grantor. In the case of <i>Hamilton</i> v. <i>Russel,</i> this court declared an absolute bill of sale of a personal chattel, of which the vendor retained the possession, to be a fraud. But the difference is a marked one, between a conveyance which purports to be absolute, and a conveyance which, from its terms, is to leave the possession in the vendor. If, in the latter case, the retaining of possession was evidence of fraud, no mortgage could be valid. The possession universally remains with the grantor, until the creditor becomes entitled to his money, and either chuses, or is compelled to exert his right. That the grantor is to receive the rents and profits, till the grantee shall become entitled to demand the money which the deed is intended to secure, is a usual covenant.</p>
<p>That the property stood bound for future advances, is, in itself, unexceptionable. It may, indeed, be converted to improper purposes, but it is not positively inadmissible. It is frequent for a person who expects to become more considerably indebted, to mortgage property to his creditor, as a security for debts to be contracted, as well as for that which is already due. All the covenants in this deed appear to the court to be fair, legitimate, and consistent with common usage. It will barely be observed, that the validity of this conveyance is to be tested by the statutes of Virginia, which embrace this subject. But this is not mentioned as having any influence in this case.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*90</span> The second point for which the plaintiffs contend is, that this is a case in which the priority of payment claimed by the United States in cases of insolvency, intervenes and avoids the deed.</p>
<p>This claim is opposed on two grounds. It is contended,</p>
<p>1st. That at the time of making this deed, Fitzgerald was not insolvent in point of fact; and,</p>
<p>2d. That this deed was not a transaction which evidences insolvency under the act of congress.</p>
<p>In construing the statutes on this subject, it has been stated by the court, on great deliberation, that the priority to which the United States are entitled, does not partake of the character of a <i>lien</i> on the property of public debtors. This distinction is always to be recollected.</p>
<p>In the case at bar, it will be observed, on the first objection made by the defendants, that the insolvency, which is the foundation of the claim, must certainly be proved by the United States. It must appear that at the time of making the conveyance, Fitzgerald was "a debtor not having sufficient property to pay all his debts." The abstract from the books of the treasury, is undoubtedly complete evidence as far as it goes; but it is not intended to show the state of Fitzgerald's accounts in January, 1799. If that had been its object, it would have credited him for the bonds then reported to be on hand. If the case turned entirely on this point, the court would probably send it back for further explanation respecting it. But this would be unnecessary, as it is the opinion of the court that the decree is right, however this fact may stand.</p>
<p>If a debtor of the United States, who makes a <i>bona fide</i> conveyance of part of his property for the security of a creditor, is within the act which gives a preference to the government, then would that preference be in the nature of a <i>lien</i> from the instant he became indebted; the inconvenience of which, where the debtor continued to transact business with the world, would certainly be very great.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*91</span> The words of the act extend the meaning of the word <i>insolvency,</i> to cases where "a debtor, not having <i>sufficient property to pay all his debts,</i> shall have made a voluntary assignment <i>thereof,</i> for the benefit of his or her creditors." The word <i>"property"</i> is unquestionably all the property which the debtor possesses; and the word <i>"thereof"</i> refers to the word <i>"property"</i> as used, and can only be satisfied by an assignment of all the property of the debtor. Had the legislature contemplated a partial assignment, the words <i>"or part thereof,"</i> or others of similar import, would have been added.</p>
<p>If a trivial portion of an estate should be left out, for the purpose of evading the act, it would be considered as a fraud upon the law, and the parties would not be enabled to avail themselves of such a contrivance. But where a <i>bona fide</i> conveyance of part is made, not to avoid the law, but to secure a fair creditor, the case is not within the letter or the intention of the act.</p>
<p>It is observable, that the term <i>insolvency</i> was originally used, and the subsequent sentence is designed to explain the meaning and intent of the term. The whole explanation relates to such a general divestment of property, as would, in fact, be equivalent to insolvency in its technical sense.</p>
<p>It is the opinion of the court, that there is no error in the decree of the circuit court, and that it be affirmed.</p>
<p>After the opinion was given, it was stated, that the court below had decreed the United States to pay costs, and it was suggested that that circumstance might have escaped the notice of this court, in affirming the decree generally.</p>
<p><i>Mason</i> observed, that costs were only given by statute, and that the United States are not bound by a statute, unless they are expressly named in it. That there was no means of compelling the United States to pay them.</p>
<p>MARSHALL, Ch. J. That would make no difference, because we are to presume they would pay them if bound by law so to do.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*92</span> <i>Mason.</i> There is no precedent of a judgment against the United States for costs. In the case of the <i>United States</i> v. <i>La Vengeance,</i> 3 <i>Dal.</i> 301, the decree of the circuit court was affirmed <i>with costs.</i> But the next day the Chief Justice directed the words "with costs" to be struck out, as there appeared to have been some cause for the prosecution. But he observed, in doing this, the court did not mean to be understood as at all deciding the question, whether, in any case, they could award costs against the United States, but left it entirely open for future discussion.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>
<i>March</i> 6<i>th.</i>
</h2>
<p>The court directed the decree of the court below to be affirmed, except as to costs, and reversed so much of the decree as awarded the United States to pay costs, and directed that no costs be allowed to either party in this court.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Jones</i>, for plaintiff in error. There are two objections to the proceedings of the court below.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p12">
<span class="num">12</span>
<p class="indent">1st. That the <i>alias capias</i> and the bond include 22 pounds of tobacco for the clerk's fee, in issuing the <i>alias capias</i>.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p13">
<span class="num">13</span>
<p class="indent">2d. That the <i>alias capias</i> does not include 12 cents, taxed as part of the costs on the original judgment.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p14">
<span class="num">14</span>
<p class="indent">For this variance between the bond and the original judgment, the court below ought not to have awarded execution upon the bond, but ought to have quashed both the bond and the execution upon which it was founded.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p15">
<span class="num">15</span>
<p class="indent">Every execution must pursue the judgment, or it is void.</p>

</div>
<div class="num" id="p17">
<span class="num">17</span>
<p class="indent">No fee is given by statute for issuing an <i>alias capias</i>. The execution was therefore void, and no subsequent release of the fee by the plaintiff can make it good. The plaintiff, if he takes out an <i>alias ca. sa.</i> must do it at his own cost. The words of the act of assembly (<i>Revised Code, p.</i> 308, Â§ 2.) are, 'when any writ of execution shall issue, and the party, at whose suit the same is issued, shall afterwards desire to take out another writ of execution at his own proper costs and charges, the clerk may issue the same, if the first writ be not returned and executed.'</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p18">
<span class="num">18</span>
<p class="indent">MARSHALL, Ch. J. Does not that relate to an <i>alias</i> taken out before the return day of the first execution?</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p19">
<span class="num">19</span>
<p class="indent"><i>Jones</i>. No <i>alias</i> execution can issue until after the return day of the first. If the first execution be returned not executed; or if it be executed and not returned, the plaintiff may have an <i>alias</i>, but it must be at his own expense.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>C. Lee</i>. If the bond was erroneous, the court would quash it as well as the execution. (<i>Simm</i> v. <i>Johnson, in the court of appeals of Virginia</i>, reported in <i>Washington's</i> or <i>Call's Reports</i>.)</p>

<div class="num" id="p22">

<p class="indent">MARSHALL, Ch. J. The plaintiff may quash the bond, and proceed on the original judgment; but the defendant can only quash the execution.

The awarding of execution on a forthcoming bond, upon motion, is a summary remedy given by statue, in derogation of the common law, and, therefore, the provisions of the statute must be strictly pursued. The release cannot aid an error in the exercise of this summary jurisdiction. I admit the practice to be, that if the bond be for more than the judgment, and the plaintiff releases the excess, it will support a judgment. So if the bond be for too small a sum, it is still good as a bond at common law. But in neither case will it support the summary proceeding by motion.</p>

<p><span class="star-pagination">*100</span> Minor, for the plaintiff, insisted on the following points, viz.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*126</span> The judges now delivered their opinions seriatim</p>
<p>JOHNSON, J.</p>
<p>This is a writ of error from the circuit court of Virginia to reverse a judgment in ejectment given for the defendant.</p>
<p>The circumstances of the case come out on a special verdict, from which it appears, that George Harmer, under whom both parties claim, was a citizen of the state of Virginia. That on the 25th June, 1782, he made a will, by which he devised "all the estate both real and personal which (he) possessed or was entitled to in the commonwealth of Virginia," to certain trustees, <span class="star-pagination">*127</span> "in trust and upon these conditions: that when John Harmer, (his) brother, (then) a subject of Great Britain, shall be capable of acquiring property in this country, then they, or the survivor of them, do convey or cause to be conveyed to him, in fee simple, a good and indefeasible title in the said estate;" and in case John Harmer should not be capable of acquiring such right before his death, he then directs the conveyance to be executed to his nephew, the plaintiff; and in case of his not being capable of acquiring lands before his death, he directs the estate to be sold and the proceeds paid over to other relations.</p>
<p>In the year 1786 George Harmer executes another will, which, as every part of it is material to the case before us, I will peruse at length. (Here he read the will of 1786.) The testator died soon after executing the last mentioned will. His brother, John Harmer, died in 1793, having never become a citizen.</p>
<p>The jury further find that John Lambert, the plaintiff, is a British subject, was born before the revolution, viz. in the year 1752, and is heir at law to the testator. The treaties with Great Britain, and an act of Virginia, vesting in George Gilmer any interest that may have escheated, are also found in the verdict. The land sued for, is a part of the Marrowbone tract. The questions suggested are,</p>
<p>1. What estate is conveyed to George Gilmer by the will of 1786?</p>
<p>2. If but an estate for life, does the will of 1782 remain unrevoked as to the remainder, so as to convey it to the plaintiff?</p>
<p>3. And last. Is John Lambert disqualified to inherit as an alien; or, if incapable, generally as such, is he not protected by the treaties existing between this government and Great Britain, particularly the 4th article of the treaty of London?</p>
<p>To form a judgment on the first point, it is necessary to consider,</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*128</span> 1. The general import and effect of the word estate, as applied to a devise of realty.</p>
<p>2. Whether its general import is controuled or altered by the subsequent words used in a similar sense in the will of 1786.</p>
<p>I consider the doctrine as well established, that the word estate, made use of in a devise of realty, will carry a fee, or whatever other interest the devisor possesses. And I feel no disposition to vary the legal effect of the word, whether preceded by my or the, or followed by at or in, or in the singular or plural number. The intent with which it is used, is the decisive consideration; and I should not feel myself sanctioned in refining away the operation of that intent, by discriminations so minute, as those which have been attempted at different stages of English jurisprudence.</p>
<p>The word estate, in testamentary cases, is sufficiently descriptive both of the subject and the interest existing in it. It is unquestionably true, that its meaning may be restricted by circumstances or expressions indicative of its being used in a limited or particular sense, so as to confine it to the subject alone; but certainly, in its general use, it is understood to apply more pertinently to the interest in the subject. To one not accustomed to the discriminations of technical refinement, it would seem that no doubt could be entertained as to the interest devised to Gilmer. The plain, ordinary import of the words would convey the idea of an absolute disposition of every article of property disposed of by the will. That words of inheritance are necessary to convey a fee, is certainly a good general rule of the common law; but, in the case of wills, it is entirely subordinate to expressions of the testator's intention.</p>
<p>In the case before us, there is no necessity for extending the decision of the court beyond the words made use of in disposing of the Marrowbone tract. But it is contended, that the words adopted by the testator, in devising the two other tracts, are used in the same sense as those in the first devising clause, and being of a <span class="star-pagination">*129</span> more restricted signification, ought to limit the word estate to a description of the mere locality. I think otherwise. When a word is made use of to which a clear legal signification has been attached by successive adjudications, it ought rather, in my estimation, to controul the meaning of those of a more equivocal purport. But the construction of a will ought to depend much more upon the evident intent of the testator, than upon the strict import of any term that he may make use of. Too critical an examination of the diction of a will is rather calculated to mislead the court, than to conduct it to a just conclusion.</p>
<p>I infer the intent of the testator, in the case before us, from the following circumstances, extracted from the special verdict.</p>
<p>1. In the first clause of the will of 1782, the testator makes use of the expression "all the estate both real and personal which I possess or am entitled to in the commonwealth of Virginia," evidently under an impression that the word estate is sufficient to convey a fee; because, out of the estate, thus devised to his trustees, he instructs them to convey to his brother, or nephew, in the alternative stated, a good and indefeasible title in fee simple.</p>
<p>2. There is no reason to infer, from any thing in this case, that the testator intended only to make a partial disposition of his property; that he intended to die intestate as to any part of it. The fair presumption generally is, that he who enters upon making a will, intends to make a full distribution of every thing that he possesses. That such was the particular intention of this testator, I think fairly inferible from the general nature of the residuary bequest. The word other, in my opinion, is referible to the whole preceding part of the will, and excludes, as well the lands devised to Gilmer, as the negroes and horses which he directs to be sold. We must give it this construction, or else suppose, either that the word property, here used, is confined to personalty, or, that it includes every thing that he possessed, both real and personal; in which latter case it would comprise even the lands previously disposed <span class="star-pagination">*130</span> of. It follows, therefore, that in the clause in which he proposes to dispose of the whole residue of his property, he omits making any disposition of any interest in the lands in question; evidently, as it impresses me, upon the supposition that he had already disposed of his whole interest in them. What object could the testator propose to himself by dying intestate as to the remainder, in fee, in the lands in question? He knew that his heir at law was an alien, and, as such, incapable of holding lands under a government to which he did not owe allegiance. This circumstance is evident from the will of 1782; and it is equally evident, from the same will, that he felt that repugnance, which is common to all men, at the idea of suffering his lands to escheat, and knew the means of preventing it.</p>
<p>I am, therefore, of opinion, upon the first point, that George Gilmer took a fee in the land, which is the subject of this suit; and this opinion disposes also of the second point, and renders it unnecessary for me to consider the third.</p>
<p>WASHINGTON, J. The only question in this cause which I mean to consider is, whether the will of George Harmer, made in 1786, passes to George Gilmer an estate in fee, or for life in the Marrowbone land. The words of the clause containing the bequest are, "I give to Doctor George Gilmer, of Albemarle county, all the estate called Marrowbone, lying in Henry county, containing, by estimation, 2,585 acres, and likewise, one other tract called Horse-pasture, containing, by estimation, 2,500 acres; also one other tract containing, by estimation, 667 1-2 acres, called Poison-field.</p>
<p>The rule of law most certainly is, that where, in a devise of real estate, there are no words of limitation superadded to the general words of bequest, nothing passes but an estate for life; but since, in most cases, this rule goes to defeat the probable intention of the testator, who, in general, is unacquainted with technical phrases, and is presumed to mean a disposition of his whole interest, unless he uses words of limitation, courts, to effectuate this intention, will lay hold of general expressions in the will, which, from their legal import, comprehend the whole interest <span class="star-pagination">*131</span> of the testator in the thing devised. But if other words be used, restraining the meaning of the general expressions, so as to render it doubtful whether the testator intended to pass his whole interest or not, the rule of law which favours the right of the heir must prevail. Thus, it has been determined, that the words "all my estate at or in such a place," unless limited and restrained by other words, may be resorted to as evidence of an intention to pass, not only the land itself, but also, the interest which the testator had in it. But words which import nothing more than a specification of the thing devised, as "all my lands," "all my farms," and the like, have never been construed to pass more than an estate for life, even when aided by an introductory clause, declaring an intention to dispose of all his estate. Except for the establishment of general principles, very little aid can be procured from adjudged cases in the construction of wills. It seldom happens that two cases can be found precisely alike, and in the present instance, I do not recollect that a single one was read at the bar which bears an analogy to it. The case of Wilson and Robinson, which comes the nearest to it, is of doubtful authority. No reasons are given by the court for their opinion, and, consequently, it is impossible to know whether it was or was not influenced by other parts of the will. lbbetson v. Beckwith was decided upon a manifest intent to pass the inheritance arising out of the different parts of the will taken together, amongst which is to be found an introductory clause which, the chancellor says, affords evidence that the testator had in view his whole estate. The cases of the Countess of Bridgewater v. the Duke of Bolton, and Bailis v. Gale, only lay down the general principle which is not denied, that the word "estate" in a will, standing alone, and unqualified by other words, is sufficient to pass the whole of the testator's interest. The words "all my land and estate," in the case of Barry and Edgeworth express so plainly an intention to give a fee, that I only wonder a question could have been made of it. They are quite as strong as if the testator had given the land, and all his interest in the land, where the word estate or interest, unless construed, as was done in that case, would have been perfectly nugatory. In Goodwin v. Goodwin, the chancellor doubted whether the word estate was not so limited and restrained by strong words of locality and description as to deprive it of the interpretation generally given to it.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*132</span> In the case now under consideration, there is no introductory clause declaratory of an intention in the testator to dispose of the whole of his estate; yet, I admit, that if he had devised all his estate called Marrowbone, without using other words calculated to limit the technical meaning of the word estate, the cases cited by the defendant's counsel would establish, beyond a doubt, that a fee passed. But I cannot read this clause of the will without feeling satisfied that the testator did not mean to use the word estate in its technical sense. For he not only varies the description of the tracts of land called Horse-pasture and Poison-field, so as to show that, with respect to them, he only meant to describe their situation and quantity; but, by using the word "other," it is plain, that with respect to the Marrowbone estate, his design was the same. Unless, in the disposition of this latter estate, he had described, or intended to describe it as so much land, he could not, with any propriety, speak of the Horse-pasture estate as another tract of land. It will hardly be said that the devise of the last tracts pass more than an estate for life, unless the word estate, before used, can be transferred to those tracts, so as to impart to the expressions there used, the technical meaning given to the word estate where it stands alone. But I cannot perceive how this is to be done without supplying words not used by the testator, and which there is no necessity for doing in order to make sense of the clause as it stands. It would, I think, be going too far to supply more than is necessary to make each devise a complete sentence, and then to introduce the preposition "in" for the purpose of making sense of the whole. Yet, if this be not done, the word estate cannot, in respect to the Horse-pasture and Poison-field tracts, be pressed into the service, and made in any manner to fit the sentence.</p>
<p>If only an estate for life in the Horse-pasture and Poison-field tracts passed to George Gilmer, it will, I think, be very difficult to maintain, that the word estate, in the same sentence, governed by the same verb, and coupled with the words which describe those tracts of land, can be construed to pass a fee.</p>
<p>The testator certainly uses the words estate and tract of land, as synonimous expressions; and then the question will be, whether the generality of the first shall enlarge <span class="star-pagination">*133</span> the plain and usual import of the latter words, or the latter restrain the technical meaning of the former? I know of no case where the word estate is used at all, in which its general import is limited and restrained by so many and such strong expressions descriptive of the land, and totally inapplicable to the interest of the testator, as in the present. The words, the estate called Marrowbone, lying in Henry county, containing, by estimation, so many acres, excite, at first, no other ideas than such as respect the name and situation of the land, with the number of acres contained in it. The description would be equally accurate, whether the interest of the testator were a fee, or a term for years.</p>
<p>If, then, we are to search after and to effectuate the intentions of men supposed to be unacquainted with legal phrases, and are, on that account, to construe the words they use with indulgence, I think we shall be more likely to fulfil this duty by limiting the general import of a technical word, which, in its common use, is entirely equivocal, and is rendered particularly ambiguous in this case by the words which immediately attend it, than by giving to the words tract of land, a meaning which they do not, in themselves, import, and are seldom, if ever, used to express more than a local description of the thing itself.</p>
<p>As the opinion of a majority of the court is in favour of the defendant upon the construction of the will, I do not think it necessary to say any thing upon the doctrine of alienage, as that question may possibly come on in some other case, in which it must be decided.</p>
<p>PATERSON, J. The devise in the will of George Harmer, was intended to convey some interest in the Marrowbone farm to George Gilmer; and the quantity of interest, whether for life or in fee, is the question now to be considered. It is a fundamental maxim, upon which the construction of every will must depend, that the intention of the testator, as disclosed by the will, shall be fully and punctually carried into effect, if it be not in contradiction to some established rule of law. In such case, the intention must yield to the rule. This intention is to be collected from the instrument itself, and not from extrinsic circumstances; and, therefore, the <span class="star-pagination">*134</span> will of A can afford little or no aid in discovering the intention and expounding the will of B. Indeed, the number of cases which are usually cited in arguments on devises, tend to obscure rather than to illuminate. When, however, a particular expression in a will has received a definite meaning, by express adjudications, such definite meaning must be adhered to, for the sake of uniformity of decision, and of security in the disposal of landed property. It cannot be questioned, that the word "estate" will carry every thing, both the land and the interest in it, unless it be restrained by particular expressions; for estate is genus generalissimum, and comprehends both the land and the inheritance. 1 Salk. 236. 6 Mod. 106. Pr. Ch. 264. 2 P.W. 524. Ca. Tem. Talbot, 157. 1 Vez. 226. 2 Vez. 179. 3 Atk. 486. <span class="citation no-link"><span class="volume">5</span> <span class="reporter">Bur.</span> <span class="page">2638</span></span>. 1 Term Rep. 411. The word "estate" is the most general, significant, and operative, that can be used in a well and, according to all the cases, may embrace every degree and species of interest. If the word "estate" stand by itself, as if a man devise "all his estate to A," it carries a fee from its established and legal import and operation. Standing thus per se, it marks the intention of the testator, passes the inheritance to the devisee, and controuls the rule in favour of the heir at law. It is true, that this word, when coupled with things that are personal only, shall be restrained to the personalty. Noscitur a sociis. The word "estate" may also, from the particular phraseology, connected with the apparent intent of the testator, assume a local form and habitation, so as to limit its sense to the land itself. Here uncommon particularity of description is requisite, so as to leave the mind perfectly satisfied, that the thing only was in contemplation, and nothing more. A description merely local cannot be extended beyond locality, without departing from the obvious import of the words; and thus making, instead of construing the will of the testator. But when no words are made use of to manifest the intention of the testator that the term "estate" should be taken, not in a general, but in a limited signification, then it will pass a fee; because the law declares, that it designates and comprehends both the subject and the interest. Nay, such is the legal import and operation of the word "estate," that it carries a fee, even when expressions of locality are annexed. To illustrate this position by apposite and adjudged <span class="star-pagination">*135</span> cases: If a man, in his will, says, "I give all my estate in A," it has been held, that the whole of the testator's interest in such particular lands passed to the devisee, though no words of limitation are added. 2 P. Will. 524. So the word "estate" was held to carry a fee, though it denoted locality, "as my estate at Kirby-Hall." 2 Atk. 37. Tuffnel v. Page. S.C. Barn. Cha. R. 9. On which Lord Hardwicke observed, that though this is a locality, yet the question is, whether it is such a locality as is sufficient to show the testator's intention merely to be to convey the lands themselves, and not the interest in them. He was of opinion, that the words were descriptive both of the local situation, and the quantity of interest. And in Ibbetson v. Beckwith, Lord Talbot observed, that the word "estate," in its proper, legal sense, means the inheritance, and carries a fee. Why, indeed, may not locality and interest be connected, and the same words express and convey both? To exclude interest in the subject, the expressions coupled with the word "estate" must be so restrictive and local in their nature, as to convey solely the idea of locality, and not to comprehend the quantum of interest, without doing violence to the words and intention of the testator. Besides, it is a just remark, repeatedly made by Lord Hardwicke and Lord Mansfield, that where a general devise of land is narrowed down to an estate for life, the intention of the testator is commonly defeated, because people do not distinguish between real and personal property; and, indeed, "common sense would never teach a man the difference;" and therefore, judges have endeavoured to make the word "estate," in a will, amount to a devise of the whole interest, unless unequivocal and strong expressions are added to restrict its general signification. It would be a laborious and useless task, to enter into a minute and critical investigation of the great variety of cases which bear on this subject. They are collected in a note by the editor of Willes' Reports, 296.</p>
<p>From the whole scope and complexion of the will of George Harmer, it is evident to my mind, that the testator intended to dispose of all his property, both with regard to the quantity and quality thereof. He did not mean to die intestate as to any part of his estate; but, on the contrary, it was his manifest intention to leave nothing undisposed of by his will. He directs that all his negroes, <span class="star-pagination">*136</span> horses, and other property be sold, &amp;c. which plainly indicates what his intention was in regard to the lands which he had previously devised. This last clause evinces and illustrates the meaning of the testator, and removes every particle of doubt from my mind, as to the true construction which ought to be put on the word "estate." To effectuate this intention, the term "estate" is to be taken in its largest signification, as comprehending both the subject and the interest, the land and the inheritance.</p>
<p>Amidst the great mass of cases arising on wills, it is impossible to select any two, that are exactly similar. The variety of expressions is infinite; and it is from the language, that we are to discover the intent. The same word, indeed, may be taken in a different sense in different wills, and even in different parts of the same will, owing to its juxtaposition, its associations, and the manner in which it is placed and used. The case of Bailis v. Gale, in 2 Vez. 48, may serve to elucidate the devise under review, in more points than one. "I give to my son, Charles Gale, all that estate I bought of Mead, after the death of my wife." These expressions seem strongly to mark locality in contradistinction to interest. But, what says my Lord Hardwicke? "I am of opinion, that both the thing itself, and the estate, property, and interest the testator had, pass by the devise. Several questions have arisen in courts of law and equity on devises of this kind; but, all the latter determinations have extended and leaned as much as possible to make words of this kind comprehend, not only the thing given, but the estate and interest the testator had therein. But, it is objected, the pronoun "my" is not added; there was no occasion for it. It was necessary he should use such words as point out the whole interest in the land, which is sufficiently done by the other words; for he bought of Mead, the land and the fee simple in the land; which is agreeable to the construction of the word estate, being sufficient to describe the thing, and the interest, as it is in the case of all my estate." So, in the present will, the words, "I give all the estate called Marrowbone," contain a description of the land, and the interest in it. The case in Vez. is particularly <span class="star-pagination">*137</span> applicable, and worthy of attention in another respect, as it affords a complete answer to the distinction, which was ingeniously raised, and attempted to be sustained between the import of the word "my" and "the," in devises like the present. The counsel for Lambert contended, that the word the, "all the estate," was descriptive of the thing; whereas, the word my, "all my estate," was descriptive of the interest as well as of the thing. But, in the case of Bailis v. Gale, Lord Hardwicke held, with great clearness, that there was no difference between a devise of all my estate at N, and a devise of all the estate at N, and that a fee passed in either case. Nor ought this opinion to be considered as extrajudicial; for the counsel in Bailis v. Gale insisted, that the pronoun my was necessary to make the devise carry a fee; and, therefore, it claimed, very properly, the notice and decision of the court. According to this opinion, a devise of the estate called Marrowbone, in the county of Henry, must have precisely the same construction and, effect, as a devise of all my estate called Marrowbone, in the county of Henry; which, it appears to me, would unquestionably give a fee.</p>
<p>Some expressions in a will, as, "I give my farm, my plantation, my house, my land," do, of themselves, contain no more than a description of the thing, and carry only an estate for life, because unconnected with words of inheritance, or other words of a similar import. For we are not permitted to enlarge the estate of a devise, unless the words of the devise itself be sufficient for that purpose. In the present devise, the words, "all the estate called Marrowbone," are competent to carry the degree of interest contended for on the part of the defendant; and this construction accords with the intention of the testator, as disclosed by his will. Whether it would not have been more beneficial to society to have observed, from the first, the same technical phraseology and strictness of legal terms in devises, as in conveyances of landed property, is a question which may amuse the theoretical jurist; but which, as judges, we cannot seriously discuss; for it is a leading axiom in our system of jurisprudence, not to be shaken by judicial authority; <span class="star-pagination">*138</span> that the intent of the testator, so far as it is consistent with the principles of law, must be attended to, and controul the decision. I am, therefore, of opinion, that the words, "I give to George Gilmer all the estate called Marrowbone, in the county of Henry," give a fee, being descriptive equally of the quantity of interest, and locality of the thing devised.</p>
<p>CUSHING, J. The first question in this case is, whether the devise to George Gilmer, in the will of George Harmer, made in 1786, carries a fee by the words "all the estate called Marrowbone, in the county of Henry, containing, by estimation, 2,585 acres of land," &amp;c.</p>
<p>Wills are expounded more favourably, to carry the intent of the testator into effect, than conveyances at common law, which take effect in the life-time of the parties; wills being frequently made by people enfeebled by age or indisposition, and without the aid of council learned in the law. Therefore, words not so technical for the purpose, have, in a great variety of cases, for above a hundred years, been construed by the judges, to carry a fee, which would not do so in a deed.</p>
<p>In a number of cases, the word "estate" has been determined to comprehend the whole interest in the land. Among those adduced, there are several which appear to me essentially in point to the present case.</p>
<p>In the case, 2 Lev. 91, (a case which has since been held, by good judges, to be good law) a devise of "all my tenant right estate, at B. in Underbarrow," was determined to import a fee.</p>
<p>I see no essential difference between that case and this; except the particle "the" instead of the pronoun "my," which, in common sense, and in the opinion of Lord Hardwicke, makes no difference. "All the estate" is, at least, as extensive and comprehensive as "all my estate."</p>
<p>In 2 P. Will. 523, the words "all my lands and estate in upper Catesby, in Northamptonshire," were adjudged <span class="star-pagination">*139</span> to carry a fee. That agrees with the case at bar, except that the word "lands" precedes "estate," which I think immaterial. "Estate" is the most operative word.</p>
<p>In the case of Bailis v. Gale, 2 Vez. 48, a devise of "all that estate that I bought of Mead," was determined by Lord Hardwicke to be of a fee. This, I think, is substantially like the case at bar; and by him, that, the, or my, makes no material difference. Add to this, what seems to make the point conclusive, the testator appears to have a design to dispose of his whole estate.</p>
<p>The other cases cited do not appear to contradict these; but, varying in some circumstances, seem not so directly applicable; yet, by the spirit and reasonings attending them, they tend to confirm the rectitude of the other decisions which are more directly in point.</p>
<p>The latter part of the devise in question, of several tracts of land immediately succeeding the devise of "all the estate called Marrowbone, in the county of Henry," &amp;c. if considered as not carrying a fee, I conceive, would not, however, controul or restrict the prior part of the devise of "all the estate called Marrowbone," &amp;c. Rather than that, I should suppose the former part would carry spirit and meaning to the latter. But that is not necessary now to be determined.</p>
<p>The first point being determined in favour of the defendant, the former judgment must be affirmed.</p>

<p><span class="star-pagination">*144</span> E.J. Lee, for plaintiff in error.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*155</span> MARSHALL, Ch. J. delivered the opinion of the court.</p>
<p>This suit was instituted to recover the freight of a vessel of which the plaintiff was a mortgagee. Upon inspecting the deed, which is the foundation of the action, it appears to have been admitted to record, on the oath of only two subscribing witnesses. This suggested the preliminary question, whether a deed of mortgage, so recorded, was not absolutely void as to creditors and subsequent purchasers? This question depends on the construction of two acts of the legislature of Virginia. The first is entitled, "An act for regulating conveyances." The 4th section of that act is in these words; <span class="star-pagination">*156</span> "All bargains, sales," &amp;c. The first member of the sentence relates to lands only, the second to marriage settlements, wherein either lands or personal estate should be settled; and the third relates to deeds of trust and mortgages. Terms descriptive of personal estate are omitted, but the word "whatsoever" would certainly comprehend a mortgage of a personal chattel, as well as of lands, if not restrained by other words manifesting an intent to restrain them.</p>
<p>It is argued, that this intent is clearly manifested. The whole act relates to real estate, except that part of it which respects marriage settlements. Its title is "an act concerning conveyances," and all its provisions are adapted to the conveyance of lands, except in the particular case of marriage settlements; and in that case, the act provides expressly for recording a settlement of chattels. This act, it is said, contains no "directions" for recording a deed of trust or mortgage for a personal thing, and, consequently, such deed cannot be within it.</p>
<p>The first section of the act respects conveyances of lands only, and directs, that they shall be acknowledged or proved by the oath of three witnesses in the general court, or court of the district, county, city, or corporation in which the lands lie.</p>
<p>The second respects marriage settlements, and directs, that if lands be conveyed or covenanted to be conveyed, they shall be proved and recorded in the same manner as had been prescribed in the first section; but if only slaves, money, or other personal thing be settled, the deed is to be proved and recorded before the court of the district, county, or corporation in which the party dwells, or as afterwards directed.</p>
<p>The third section relates only to the proving and recording of livery of seisin.</p>
<p>Then follows the fourth section, which requires, among other enumerated conveyances, that "all deeds of trust and mortgages whatsoever" shall be void as to creditors and subsequent purchasers, if not acknowledged or proved, and recorded "according to the directions <span class="star-pagination">*157</span> of the act." There being no "directions" which are applied to mortgages, unless lands be conveyed in them, it has been argued, that such mortgages only, as convey lands, are comprehended within the act.</p>
<p>The act, it must be acknowledged, is very obscurely penned in this particular respect, and there is so much strength in the argument for confining it to mortgages of lands, that, if a mortgage of a personal chattel could be brought within the provisions of any other act, the court would be disposed to adopt the construction contended for.</p>
<p>The plaintiff insists, that such a mortgage is comprehended in the 2d section of the "act to prevent frauds and perjuries."</p>
<p>That act avoids fraudulent conveyances; and declares, that deeds of personal chattels, not upon a valuable consideration, where the possession remains with the donor; or, a reservation of interest in the donor, where possession passes to the donee, shall be fraudulent and void, unless proved and recorded according to the directions of the act. A mortgage made on a valuable consideration, would be very clearly excluded from the 2d section, although the act contained nothing further on the subject. But to remove the possibility of doubt, the 3d section declares, that the act shall not extend to any conveyance made "upon good consideration and bona fide."</p>
<p>The meaning of the word "good," in the statute of frauds, is settled to be the same with "valuable."</p>
<p>It is, therefore, perfectly clear, that the case is altogether omitted, or is provided for in the act concerning conveyances. In a country where mortgages, of a particular kind of personal property, are frequent, it can scarcely be supposed that no provision would be made for so important and interesting a subject. The inconvenience resulting from the total want of such a provision would certainly be great; and the court, therefore, ought not to suppose the case to be entirely omitted, if there be any legislative act which may fairly be construed <span class="star-pagination">*158</span> to comprehend it. The act concerning conveyances, although not penned with that clearness which is to be wished, does yet contain terms which are sufficient to embrace the case, and the best judicial opinions of that state concur in this exposition of it.</p>
<p>Although the point was not directly decided in the case of Hill and Claiborne, the court of appeals appear to have proceeded on this construction; and Judge Tucker, in discussing this subject, avows the same opinion.</p>
<p>Upon a consideration of the acts on this subject, Butts being a creditor, it is the opinion of the court, that the deed of mortgage, in the proceedings mentioned, was void as to him.</p>
<p>The counsel for the plaintiff contends, that, although the mortgage-deed be void, yet Hodgson is entitled to recover, because he has paid money to the order of Butts, under the mistaken opinion that he was entitled to the freight.</p>
<p>This allegation is not made out in point of fact. Hodgson was in possession of the vessel as the absolute purchaser before he paid for the disbursements he is now endeavouring to recover. It does not appear that he paid these disbursements in the confidence of receiving the freight, or that he was not compellable to pay them as owner of the vessel. The freight had previously been applied by Butts, under the authority of the Hamiltons, to the payment of a debt due to himself. He had a right, as a general creditor, to retain that freight as against the original owners, or their assignee.</p>
<p>The court is of opinion, that the judgment of the circuit court is to be affirmed with costs.</p>

<p class="date">February Term, 1805</p>
<div class="prelims">
<p class="indent">ERROR to the circuit court of the district of Columbia, sitting at Washington, upon a judgment in favour of the traverser, on a demurrer to an indictment for taking unlawful fees as a justice of the peace for the county of Washington.</p>
<p class="indent">The indictment was as follows, viz. 'United States, District of Columbia and County of Washington, to wit.</p>
<p class="indent">'The jurors for the United States, for the district of Columbia, and county of Washington, aforesaid, upon their oath present, that Benjamin More, late of the county of Washington, aforesaid, gentleman, on the 10th day of December, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and two, then being one of the justices of the peace of the United States, for the county of Washington aforesaid, at the county of Washington aforesaid, by colour of his said office, unlawfully and unjustly did demand, extort, receive and take, of and from one Richard Spalding, constable, acting for and on behalf, of one Joseph Hickman, the sum of twelve cents, and a half cent, lawful current money of the United States, for and as his fee, for executing and doing the duties of his said office, to wit, for rendering and giving judgment upon a warrant for a small debt, in a case between the said Joseph Hickman, plaintiff, and one Joseph Dove, defendant, in contempt of the law, to the great damage of them, the said Richard Spalding, and Joseph Hickman, and against the peace and government of the United States.</p>
<p class="indent">'JOHN T. MASON, <i>United States Attorney, for the district of Columbia</i>.'To this indictment, there was a general demurrer and joinder, and judgment in the court below for the <i>traverser</i>, at July Term, 1803.<a class="footnote" href="#fn2" id="fn2_ref">2</a></p>
<p class="indent"><i>Mason</i>, attorney for the United States for the district of Columbia. The act of congress of <i>February</i> 27, 1801, Â§ 11, <i>vol.</i> 5, <i>p.</i> 271, declares, 'that thereshall be appointed in and for each of the said counties, (in the district of Columbia) such number of discreet persons, to be justices of the peace, as the president of the United States shall, from time to time, think expedient, to continue in office five years. And such justices, having taken an oath for the faithful and impartial discharge of the duties of the office, shall, in all matters civil and criminal, and in whatever relates to the conservation of the peace, have all the powers vested in, and shall perform all the duties required of justices of the peace, as individual magistrates, by the laws herein before continued in force in those parts of said district for which they shall have been respectively appointed; and they shall have cognizance in personal demands to the value of 20 dollars, exclusive of costs, which sum they shall not exceed, any law to the contrary notwithstanding; and they shall be entitled to receive for their services, the fees allowed for like services by the laws herein before adopted and continued in the eastern part of said district.'</p>
<p class="indent">By the 4th section of the act of congress of <i>3d March</i>, 1801, <i>vol.</i> 5, <i>p.</i> 288, the magistrates are constituted a board of commissioners, with certain duties and fees annexed to that office. And by the act of 3d of <i>May</i>, 1802, <i>vol.</i> 6, <i>p.</i> 181, Â§ 8, it is enacted, 'that so much of two acts of congress, the one passed on the 27th of February, 1801, entitled, 'An act concerning the district of Columbia,' the other passed the 3d day of March, 1801, supplementary to the aforesaid act, as provides for the compensation to be made to certain justices of the peace thereby created,' 'shall be, and the same is hereby repealed.' The question for the decision of this court is, whether congress had a constitutional right thus to abolish the fees.</p>
<p class="indent"><i>Jones</i>, contra. By the act of 1801, certain fees were annexed to the office of justice of the peace. The traverser was appointed under that act, and while the fees were thus annexed.<a class="footnote" href="#fn3" id="fn3_ref">3</a> The principle we contend for is, that he was a judge of an inferior court of the United States, and protected by the third article of the constitution, which declares, that 'the judges, both of the supreme and inferior courts, shall hold their offices during good behaviour, and shall, at stated times, receive for their services, a compensation which shall not be diminished during their continuance in office.'</p>
<p class="indent">A law for abolishing the fees can only affect those justices who have been appointed since the passage of that law.</p>
<p class="indent">It has been decided in this court, in the case of <i>Marbury</i> v. <i>Madison, (ante, vol.</i> 1, <i>p.</i> 162.) that a justice of the peace in the district of Columbia does not hold his office at the will of the president.</p>
<p class="indent">The power to make laws is expressly given; the power to epeal is not, but necessarily follows. So the power of appointment necessarily implies the power of removal, according to the maxim, <i>cujus est dare, ejus est disponere</i>. This principle was settled in congress in the year 1789, after long debate upon the tenure of office of secretary of state, and was expressed by means of a clause in the law directing what officer should take charge of the papers in that department, when the secretary of state <i>should be removed by the president</i>. Congress has no power to limit the tenure of any office to which the president is to appoint, unless in the case of a judge under the constitution. The position for which we contend is justified by principle. The jurisdiction given to a justice of the peace, makes him a judge of an inferior court. Lord Coke defines a court to be <i>a place where justice is judicially administered;</i> and this definition is recognised by Blackstone. Certain powers are incident to all courts, as to commit for contempts <i>in</i> court; for there is difference between courts of record, and courts not of record, as to contempts <i>out</i> of court.</p>
<p class="indent">By the act of 1801, the justices of the peace are to have the same powers, in all matters, civil and criminal, as were exercised by the justices of the peace in Maryland. In resorting to the Maryland code of laws, we find a very early act of assembly, which gives to justices of the peace the power of punishing contempts in their presence. Indeed, they possess a vast accumulation of powers. They may inflict whipping, imprisonment, and fine as high as 500 pounds of tobacco. They have a much more extensive jurisdiction than many more regular courts. They have cognizance of civil controversies of the value of 20 dollars. They hold courts, they try causes, they give judgments, and issue executions. Every one who consults the index to the laws of Maryland, must be satisfied that the justices of the peace constitute very important tribunals, and it is immaterial by what name they are called; they administer justice judicially; they have, therefore, the power to hold a court. The traverser was appointed before the repeal. He had a compensation, which is taken away by the repeal. It is, therefore, so far unconstitutional. It is no objection that the tenure of office is limited to five years. It is not the tenure, but the essence and nature of the office which is to decide this question. If the limitation to five years makes a difference, it would be an evasion of the constitution. But it is of no consequence how congress have determined the tenure. It is established by the constitution.</p>
<p class="indent"><i>Mason</i>, in reply. The constitution does not apply to this case. The constitution is a compact between the people of the United States in their individual capacity, and the states in their political capacity.</p>
<p class="indent">Unfortunately for the citizens of Columbia, they are not in either of these capacities.</p>
<p class="indent">The 2d section of the third article of the constitution declares, that 'the judicial power of the United States shall extend to all cases in law and equity, arising under this constitution, the laws of the United States and treaties made, or which shall be made under their authority; to all cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls; to all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction; to controversies to which the United States shall be a party; to controversies between two or more states; between a state and citizens of another state; between citizens of different states; between citizens of the same state claiming lands under grants of different states; and between a state and the citizens thereof, and foreign states, citizens or subjects.'</p>
<p class="indent">The judicial power of the United States can only extend to the cases enumerated; but the judicial power exercised in the district of Columbia, extends to other cases, and, therefore, is not the judicial power of the United States. It is a power derived from the power given to congress to <i>legislate</i> exclusively in all cases whatsoever over the district. And it is under this clause of the constitution that congress have created justices of the peace and given them power. Congress are under <i>no controul</i> in legislating for the district of Columbia. Their power, in this respect, is <i>unlimited</i>. If congress cannot limit the tenure of the office, but it <i>must</i> be during good behaviour, then a law might be passed without the concurrence of the legislative will.</p>
<p class="indent">I understand the case of <i>Marbury</i> v. <i>Madison</i> to have decided only that the justices held during good behaviour for five years under the law; and not generally during good behaviour, under the constitution.</p>
<p class="indent">The general provisions of the constitution do not apply to our case. We are the people of <i>congress</i>. They are to legislate for us, and to their laws we <i>must submit</i>.</p>
<p class="indent"><i>Jones</i>. The executive power exercised within the district of Columbia is the executive power of the United States. The legislative power exercised in the district is the legislative power of the United States.â€”And what reason can be given why the judicial power exercised in the district should not be the judicial power of the United States? If it be not the judicial power of the United States, of what nation, state or political society is it the judicial power? All the officers in the district are officers of the United States.</p>
<p class="indent">By the 2d section of the third article of the constitution, the judicial power of the United States is to extend to all cases arising under the laws of the United States. All the laws in force in the district are laws of the United States, and no case can arise which is not to be decided by those laws. What judicial power is that which is exercised by the circuit court of the district? They certainly exercise a very respectable part of the judicial power of the United States. Was it ever contended, that congress could limit the tenure of the offices of the judges of that court? or that the judges were not liable to impeachment under the constitution?</p>
<p class="indent"><i>February</i> 13.</p>
<p class="indent">The <i>Chief Justice</i> suggested a doubt whether the appellate jurisdiction of this court extends to <i>criminal cases</i>.</p>
</div>
<p class="center"><i>February</i> 22.</p>
<div class="num" id="p1">
<span class="num">1</span>
<p class="indent"><i>Mason</i>, in support of the appellate jurisdiction of this court in criminal cases.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p2">
<span class="num">2</span>
<p class="indent">By the 1st section of the third article of the constitution, the judicial power of the United States is vested in one supreme court, and in such inferior courts as the congress may, from time to time, ordain and establish.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p3">
<span class="num">3</span>
<p class="indent">By the 2d section it is extended to all cases in <i>law</i> and equity arising under the laws of the United States. This is a case in <i>law</i> arising under the laws of the United States, and is, therefore, within that section.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p4">
<span class="num">4</span>
<p class="indent">'In all cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, and those in which a state shall be party, the supreme court shall have original jurisdiction. <i>In all the other cases before-mentioned</i>, the supreme court <i>shall have</i> appellate jurisdiction, both as to law and fact, <i>with such exceptions, and under such regulations</i>, as the congress shall make.'Congress has made no exception of criminal cases. I understand it to have been said by this court, that it is necessary that congress should have made a <i>regulation</i> to enable this court to exercise its appellate jurisdiction. Upon this point I consider myself bound by the case of <i>Clarke</i> v. <i>Bazadone, ante, vol.</i> 1. <i>p.</i> 212. It is clear, then, that this court has the jurisdiction, and the only question is, whether congress has made such a <i>regulation</i> as will enable this court to exercise it.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p5">
<span class="num">5</span>
<p class="indent">Such a regulation is contained in the 14<i>th section of the judiciary of</i> 1789, <i>vol.</i> 1. <i>p.</i> 58, 59, which enacts, 'that all the before-mentioned courts of the United States shall have power to issue writs of <i>scire facias, habeas corpus</i>, and all other writs, not specially provided for by statute, which may be necessary for the exercise of their respective jurisdictions, and agreeable to the principles and usages of law.' The writ of error in a criminal case is a writ not provided for by statute, and necessary for the exercise of the appellate jurisdiction given to the supreme court by the constitution, and agreeable to the principles and usages of law. This court has, therefore, the power to issue it.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p6">
<span class="num">6</span>
<p class="indent">There is no reason why the writ of error should be confined to civil cases. A man's life, his liberty, and his good name, are as dear to him as his property; and inferior courts are as liable to err in one case as in the other. There is nothing in the nature of the cases which should make a difference; nor is it a novel doctrine that a writ of error should lie in a criminal case. They have been frequent in that country from which we have drawn almost all our forms of judicial proceedings.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p7">
<span class="num">7</span>
<p class="indent">It is true, that it is expressly given by the act of congress of 1789, in civil cases only, but it does not thence follow that it should be denied in criminal.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p8">
<span class="num">8</span>
<p class="indent">MARSHALL, Ch. J. If congress had erected inferior courts, without saying in what cases a writ of error or appeal should lie from such courts to this, your argument would be irresistible; but when the constitution has given congress power to limit the exercise of our jurisdiction, and to make regulations respecting its exercise; and congress, under that power, has proceeded to erect inferior courts, and has said in what cases a writ of error or appeal shall lie, an exception of all other cases is implied. And this court is as much bound by an implied as an express exception.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p9">
<span class="num">9</span>
<p class="indent"><i>Mason</i>. When legislating over the district of Columbia, congress are bound by no constitution. If they are, they have violated it by not giving us a republican form of government. The same observation will also apply to Louisiana.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p10">
<span class="num">10</span>
<p class="indent">The act of congress which gives a writ of error to the circuit court of this district, differs, in some respects, from that which gives the writ of error to the other courts of the United States.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p11">
<span class="num">11</span>
<p class="indent">The words of the judiciary act of 1789, section 22, are, 'and upon a like process, (that is, by a writ of error, citation, &amp;c.) may final judgments and decrees in <i>civil actions</i>, and suits in equity in a circuit court,' &amp;c. 'be reversed or affirmed in the supreme court.'</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p12">
<span class="num">12</span>
<p class="indent">But in the law concerning the district of Columbia, Â§ 8, <i>vol.</i> 5, <i>p.</i> 270, the expressions are, 'that <i>any</i> final judgment, order, or decree in said court, wherein the matter in dispute, exclusive of costs, shall exceed the value of one hundred dollars, may be re-examined, and reversed or affirmed in the supreme court of the United States, by writ of error or appeal, which shall be prosecuted in the same manner, under the same regulations, and the same proceedings shall be had therein, as is, or shall be provided in the case of writs of error on judgments, or appeals upon orders or decrees rendered in the circuit court of the United States.'</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p13">
<span class="num">13</span>
<p class="indent">In this section, if the words respecting the value of the matter in dispute, were excluded, a writ of error would clearly lie in a criminal case, under the general expression, <i>any final judgment</i>. Then do those words respecting the value, exclude criminal cases? Suppose the court below had imposed a fine of more than 100 dollars, the case would have been within the express words of the act. So it would have been, if a penalty of more than 100 dollars had been imposed by law.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p14">
<span class="num">14</span>
<p class="indent">But this court has exercised appellate jurisdiction in a criminal case. <i>United States</i> v. <i>Simms, ante, vol.</i> 1, <i>p.</i> 252.</p>

<span class="num">15</span>
<p class="indent">MARSHALL, Ch. J. No question was made, in that case, as to the jurisdiction. It passed <i>sub silentio</i>, and the court does not consider itself as bound by that case.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p16">

<p class="indent"><i>Mason</i>. But the traverser had able counsel, who did not think proper to make the objection.</p>

<div class="num" id="p17">
<span class="num">17</span>
<p class="indent">MARSHALL, Ch. J.<a class="footnote" href="#fn4" id="fn4_ref">4</a> delivered the opinion of the court as follows:</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p18">
<span class="num">18</span>
<p class="indent">This is an indictment against the defendant, for taking fees, under colour of his office, as a justice of the peace in the district of Columbia.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p19">
<span class="num">19</span>
<p class="indent">A doubt has been suggested respecting the jurisdiction of this court, in appeals on writs of error, from the judgments of the circuit court for that district, in criminal cases; and this question is to be decided before the court can inquire into the merits of the case.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p20">
<span class="num">20</span>
<p class="indent">In suport of the jurisdiction of the court, the attorney-general has adverted to the words of the constitution, from which he seemed to argue, that as criminal jurisdiction was exercised by the courts of the United States, under the description of, 'all cases in law and equity arising under the laws of the United States,' and as the appellate jurisdiction of this court, was extended to all enumerated cases, other than those which might be brought on originally, 'with such exceptions, and under such regulations, as the congress shall make,' that the supreme court possessed appellate jurisdiction in criminal, as well as civil cases, over the judgments of every court, whose decisions it would review, unless there should be some exception or regulation made by congress, which should circumscribe the jurisdiction conferred by the constitution.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p21">
<span class="num">21</span>
<p class="indent">This argument would be unanswerable, if the supreme court had been created by law, without describing its jurisdiction. The constitution would then have been the only standard by which its powers could be tested, since there would be clearly no congressional regulation or exception on the subject.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p22">
<span class="num">22</span>
<p class="indent">But as the jurisdiction of the court has been described, it has been regulated by congress, and an affirmative description of its powers must be understood as a regulation, under the constitution, prohibiting the exercise of other powers than those described.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p23">
<span class="num">23</span>
<p class="indent">Thus the appellate jurisdiction of this court, from the judgments of the circuit courts, is described affirmatively. No restrictive words are used. Yet it has never been supposed, that a decision of a circuit court could be reviewed, unless the matter in dispute should exceed the value of 2,000 dollars. There are no words in the act restraining the supreme court from taking cognizance of causes under that sum; their jurisdiction is only limited by the legislative declaration, that they may re-examine the decisions of the circuit court, where the matter in dispute exceeds the value of 2,000 dollars.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p24">
<span class="num">24</span>
<p class="indent">This court, therefore, will only review those judgments of the circuit court of Columbia, a power to reexamine which, is expressly given by law.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p25">
<span class="num">25</span>
<p class="indent">On examining the act, 'concerning the district of Columbia,' the court is of opinion, that the appellate jurisdiction, granted by that act, is confined to civil cases. The words, 'matter in dispute,' seem appropriated to civil cases, where the subject in contest has a value beyond the sum mentioned in the act. But, in criminal cases, the question is the guilt or innocence of the accused. And although he may be fined upwards of 100 dollars, yet that is, in the eye of the law, a punishment for the offence committed, and not the particular object of the suit.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p26">

<p> In the court below, the opinions of the judges were delivered to the following effect.</p>
<p>CHANCH, J. The question to be decided upon this demurrer is, whether the act of congress, for abolishing the fees of justices of the peace, in the district of Columbia, can affect those justices who were in commission before, and at the time when that act passed, and who accepted their commissions, while those fees were legally annexed to the office.</p>
<p>The points made in the argument of this cause, are important, and some of them, not altogether clear of doubt.</p>
<p>It has been contended, that congress, in legislating for the district of Columbia, are not bound by any of the prohibitions of the constitution.</p>
<p>But this is a doctrine to which I can never assent. Can it be said, that congress may pass a bill of <i>attainder</i> for the district of Columbia? That congress may pass laws <i>ex post facto</i> in the district, or order soldiers to be quartered upon us in a time of peace, or make our ports free ports of entry, or lay duties upon our exports, or take away the right of trial by jury, in criminal prosecutions?</p>
<p>Yet, all this they may do, if, in legislating for the district of Columbia, they are not restricted by the express prohibitions of the constitution. The words must be positive and strong indeed, to justify such a construction. The only clause from which such an inference can possibly seem to flow, is that which says, 'congress shall have power to exercise <i>exclusive</i> legislation <i>in all cases whatsoever</i>, over such district,' &amp;c.</p>
<p>But the whole instrument is to be taken together, and every part is to be made consistent with the residue, if possible. That congress may legislate, 'in all cases whatsoever, over such district,' &amp;c. is the general proposition, and the prohibitions are the exceptions. The true construction is, that congress may legislate for us, in all cases where they are not prohibited by other parts of the constitution. The express commands of the constitution operate as prohibitions of every thing repugnant to such commands. In every case, therefore, where congress are not bound, either by the commands or prohibitions of the constitution, they have a discretionary power to legislate over the district.</p>
<p>The constitution was made for the benefit of every citizen of the United States, and there is no such citizen, whatever may be his condition, or wherever he may be situated within the limits of the territory of the United States, who has not a right to the protection it affords.</p>
<p>If congress are bound by the constitution in legislating for this district, then it becomes proper to test the validity of their legislative acts, respecting the district, by the provisions of the constitution.</p>
<p>The 3d article of the constitution, provides for the independence of the judges of the courts of the United States, by certain regulations; one of which is, that they shall receive, at stated times, a compensation for their services, <i>which shall not be diminished during their continuance in office</i>.</p>
<p>The act of congress, of 27th of February, 1801, which constitutes the office of justices of the peace, and empowers them to try personal demands, of the value of 20 dollars, ascertains the compensation which they shall have for their services in holding their courts, and trying those causes. This compensation is given in the form of fees, payable when the services are rendered. The causes of which they have cognizance, are causes arising under the laws of the United States, and, therefore, the power of trying them, is part of the judicial power mentioned in the 3d article of the constitution, which expressly declares, that the judicial power of the United States, shall extend to all cases arising under those laws.</p>
<p>It is difficult to conceive how a magistrate can lawfully sit in judgment, exercising judicial powers, and enforcing his judgments by process of law, without holding a court. I consider such a court, thus exercising a part of the judicial power of the United States, as an inferior court, and the justice of the peace as the judge of that court. It is unnecessary in this cause to decide the question, whether, as such, he holds his office during good behaviour; but that his compensation shall not be diminished during his continuance in office, seems to follow as a necessary consequence from the provisions of the constitution. It has been contended, that the compensation of a justice of the peace is not within this provision of the constitution, because the act of congress has not appointed the <i>stated times</i> at which it shall be paid. It is true, that the act of congress has not said that the compensation shall be paid on any particular day, and month; but it may, perhaps, be a compliance with the clause of the constitution, which requires that it shall be receivable at stated times, to say that it shall be paid when the service is rendered. And, we are rather to incline to this construction, than to suppose the command of the constitution to have been disobeyed.</p>
<p>If, therefore, the constitution of the United States is obligatory upon congress, when legislating for this district; if a justice of the peace is a judge of an inferior court of the United States; and, if his compensation has once been fixed by law, a subsequent law for diminishing that compensation (<i>a fortiori</i> for <i>abolishing</i> it) cannot affect that justice of the peace during his continuance in office; whatever effect it may have upon those justices who have been appointed to office since the passing of the act.</p>
<p>MARSHALL, J. concurred.</p>
<p>KILTY, Ch. J. This is an indictment at common law, against the defendant, a justice of the peace, for having, under colour of his office, exacted and taken an illegal fee, as therein described.</p>
<p>The demurrer admits his being a justice, and the exaction and receipt of the fee, and rests the defence on the legality of such conduct.</p>
<p>The legality of exacting and taking fees, under colour of a public office, must depend on the express authority of law, and, therefore, the question must turn upon the acts which have passed on this subject, as it respects the district of Columbia.</p>
<p>The justices of the peace were allowed expressly to receive <i>fees</i> for their services, by the act of February, 1801, section 11, and by the 4th section of the act of March, 1801, they were, as commissioners, entitled to certain <i>fees and emoluments</i>.</p>
<p>It is possible, that if the 11th section had only provided for the appointment of justices, without speaking of their fees, the 1st section, adopting the laws of the two states, might have had the effect of giving them the fees provided by the laws of Maryland. But an inquiry into this part of the subject is not important, because, as it has been observed in the course of the argument, so <i>much</i> of those two acts as provides for the compensation to the justices, is repealed by the act of May, 1802; and it is not material to determine by which of the sections the provision was made.</p>
<p>The act of 1802, section 8, having positively declared, that this provision was repealed, and having thereby left no power existing to demand the fees before allowed, it remains only to examine into the ground on which the latter act is alleged to be unconstitutional and void.</p>
<p>According to the course which has been pursued by the supreme court, it appears unnecessary to say any thing about the power of a court to examine into the constitutionality of a law, until a case has been made out to justify such an inquiry. But, taking the power for granted, we are to inquire how it is called for in the present instance.</p>
<p>In testing an act of the legislature by the constitution, nothing less than the positive provisions of the latter can be resorted to, and without absolute restriction by the constitution, the legislative power is omnipotent over subjects submitted to it. We must, therefore, reject the idea of judging this act on the principles of a contract, and setting it aside as an infraction of such contract.</p>
<p>In support of the position, that the act of May, 1802, is unconstitutional and void, the following arguments have been urged:</p>
<p>1. That a justice is a judicial officer.</p>
<p>2. That a justice is a court.</p>
<p>3. That a justice shall receive for his services a <i>compensation</i>, which shall not be diminished during his continuance in office; and that, therefore, taking away his fees, by repealing the act which gave them, is diminishing his compensation, and is contrary to the constitution.</p>
<p>The nature of some of the duties confided to a justice of the peace may make him a judicial officer; and he might even be admitted to be a court, without bringing him within the provisions of the constitution. The first section of the third article speaks of the judicial power of the <i>United States</i>. It declares what courts it shall be vested in, and then provides, that the judges of such courts shall hold their offices during good behaviour, and shall, at stated times, receive for their services, a compensation, which shall not be diminished during their continuance in office.</p>
<p>When we consider this instrument as constituting a general government, and defining, amongst others, its judicial power, we must take it in its most extensive sense, as applying to the whole of the United States, and not to a particular territory.</p>
<p>I consider, therefore, that the judicial power given to the traverser, as a justice of the peace, is not, in the sense of the constitution, the <i>judicial power of the United States;</i> and that such justice is not such a court as is provided for in the article and section in question. The justice does not, according to that article and section, hold his office during good behaviour; nor can the power of receiving certain fees, which was given by the act of 1801, be strained to mean 'receiving at stated times a compensation for his services.'</p>
<p>The second section of the third article declares what subjects the judicial power, given by the first section, shall extend to. And by comparing these subjects with those which are cognizable by the justice in the present case, it will confirm the position, that this judicial power is not that of the <i>United States</i>, and is not provided for by this part of the constitution.</p>
<p>Congress, in organising the judiciary according to the constitution, have created a supreme court, and inferior courts. Some of the latter extend over certain circuits composed of different states, and others are confined to the respective states; but in all of them, it is the judicial power of the United States which is carried into effect.</p>
<p>I consider this judicial power as being different in its object and nature from that which may be the effect of the legislative power given to congress over this territory, or of their power to make rules, &amp;c. for such places as may become their property.</p>
<p>In order to show that the restrictions contained in the first section of the third article of the constitution do not extend to a justice in the district of Columbia, it may be necessary to make some inquiry into the principles on which the district is erected.</p>
<p>Without endeavouring to solve all the difficulties which have been mentioned in the course of the argument, I am persuaded that the following positions are correct:â€”That the district of Columbia, though belonging to the United States, and within their compass, is not, like a state, a component part, and that the provisions of the constitution, which are applicable particularly to the relative situation of the United States and the several states, are not applicable to this district.</p>
<p>That the power of congress to legislate for the district arises from the positive direction of the constitution, in the 8th section of the first article; and it may be here material to attend to the words '<i>exclusive legislation</i>,' and to discover their meaning and origin.</p>
<p>By the constitution, the legislative power of congress is confined to certain objects, and leaves to the several states a portion of the legislative power which they before possessed. But it was the intention of the framers of the constitution, to divest the ten miles square of the privileges of a state, and to give to congress the whole and exclusive power of legislation, as well on the subjects which had been left to the states, as on those which had been taken from them and given to the general governmentâ€”That the ten miles square is not in a situation to become a state without an amendment in the constitution, and therein differs from the other territories belonging to the United Statesâ€”That the word <i>exclusive</i> meaning only free from the power exercised by the several states, the legislative power to be exercised by congress may still be subject to the general restraints contained in the constitution, though it includes subjects both of a general and local nature. Thus they are restrained from suspending the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>, unless in the cases allowed; from passing (within and for the district) a bill of attainder, or <i>ex post facto</i> law; from laying therein a capitation tax; from granting therein any title of nobility; from making therein a law respecting the establishment of religion, or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; and from quartering soldiers therein, contrary to the third amendment.</p>
<p>But when congress, in exercising exclusive legislation over this territory, enact laws to give or to take away the fees of the justices of the peace, such laws cannot be tested by a provision in the constitution, evidently applicable to the judicial power of the whole United States, and containing restrictions which cannot, in their nature, affect the situation of the justices, or the nature of the compensation.</p>
<p>However ingeniously the question has been argued, I cannot feel any doubt in my mind on it. Nor can I perceive any legal or justifiable ground under which the direction of the act of 1802 has been disregarded. I am, therefore, of opinion, that the judgment on the demurrer should be for the United States.</p>
<p>But the judgment of the court is for the defendant.</p>

<p class="date">February Term, 1805</p>
<div class="prelims">
<p class="indent">THIS was an action in the circuit court of the district of Columbina, for the county of Alexandria; and the question arose upon the construction of the act of assembly of Virginia, for 'reducing into one, the several acts concerning wills,' &amp;c. <i>Revised Code, p.</i> 169, <i>c.</i> 92, Â§ 56, which is in these words, viz. 'If any suit shall be brought against any executor, or administrator, for the recovery of a debt due upon an open account, it shall be the duty of the court, before whom such suit shall be brought, to cause to be expunged from such account, every item thereof, which shall appear to have been due five years before the death of the testator, or intestate. Saving to all persons <i>non compos mentis, femes covert</i>, infants imprisoned, or <i>out of this commonwealth</i>, who may be plaintiffs in such suits <i>three years after their several disabilities removed</i>.'</p>
<p class="indent">The declaration was for plank, scantling, and foundation-stone, lent by the plaintiff to the defendant. For the like materials, sold and delivered, and for money had and received. The defendant pleaded the general issue, and a verdict was taken for the plaintiff, subject to the opinion of the court, upon the following facts:</p>
<p class="indent">'That the debt found by the verdict was due by the defendant's testator, to the plaintiff, in the year 1786. That the testator died in 1794. The plaintiff was a resident of, and in the state of Maryland, and out of the commonwealth of Virginia, when the articles were delivered for which the suit was brought, and when the debt was contracted; and continued so in Maryland, and out of the said commonwealth, until the month of June, 1795, when he removed to Alexandria to live, and hath lived there ever since. That in the year 1786, after the cause of action accrued, the plaintiff passed through the town of Alexandria, and was for a short time therein, but not as a resident thereof.'</p>
<p class="indent">Upon this statement of facts, the judgment of the court below was for the defendant; and the plaintiff brought the present writ of error.</p>
<p class="indent"><i>E. J. Lee</i>, for plaintiff in error. The plaintiff was not a citizen of Virginia, when the debt was contracted. It does not appear that he did not commence his action within the limited time, after his becoming a citizen.</p>

<div class="num" id="p1">

<p class="indent"><i>E. J. Lee</i>. Only as a traveller. It does not appear that the testator lived in Virginia at that time.

<p class="indent"><i>Swann</i>, contract. The act of limitation begins to run from the time the plaintiff passed through Alexandria, after the cause of action had accrued.

<div class="num" id="p3">
<span class="num">3</span>
<p class="indent">The plaintiff came to reside in Alexandria, in 1795. The suit was tried in 1802; hence the presumption is, that it was commenced at that time, and the plaintiff can only show the contrary by producing his writ. The state of the case negatives the idea of a loan. The claim, therefore, was upon the open account, and the court had a right to expunge all the articles charged five years before the death of the testator.</p>

<div class="num" id="p4">
<span class="num">4</span>
<p class="indent">MARSHALL, Ch. J. That act has nothing to do with the lapse of time, after the death of the testator. The <i>five</i> years, are before his death. The <i>three</i> years, are also three years during the life of the testator, and the plaintiff must, therefore, have been in the state three years, during the life of Roberdeau, to make the limitation attach to his claim.</p>

The words of the act are, 'saving to persons <i>out of this commonwealth</i>,' not persons <i>residing</i> out of this commonwealth. <i>Being 'out</i> of the commonwealth,' is the disability; <i>coming into</i> the commonwealth, therefore, is a removal of that disability. If the saving had been to persons <i>residing</i> out, &amp;c. then, possibly, a mere <i>coming in, without residing</i>, would not have been a removal of the disability. 3 <i>Wilson</i>, 145, <i>Strithorst</i> v. <i>Graeme</i>.

<p class="indent">The five years mentioned in the 56th section of the act of assembly, must have elapsed before the death of the testator. If they did not, no lapse of time after his death can bring the case within the purview of this act. In the present case, the five years had elapsed. But there is a saving clause, in the following words: 'Saving to all persons <i>non compos mentis, femes covert</i>, infants, imprisoned, or out of this commonwealth, who may be plaintiffs in such suits, three years after their several disabilities removed.'</p>

<p class="indent">It is one of the facts stated, that the plaintiff was within the commonwealth of Virginia, in the year 1786, after the cause of action accrued: the hence it is argued, that he is not within the saving clause of the section, and that, to exclude him from the benefit of that clause, it is not necessary that he should have become a resident of that state.</p>

<center><p><b>Supreme Court of United States.</b></p></center>
<center></center>
<p>The declaration was for money paid and advanced by the defendant in error for the use of the plaintiff in error.</p>
<p>Upon trial of the issue of non assumpsit two bills of exception were taken by the original defendant. The verdict was, for plaintiff 4155 dollars damages.</p>
<p>The first bill of exception stated, that the plaintiff below offered in evidence sundry bills of exchange drawn <span class="star-pagination">*343</span> by the defendant upon the plaintiff, to an amount equal to the balance demanded by the plaintiff of the defendant. Â— And also several accounts current between the defendant, and the mereantile firm of Richard S. Hackley, and Co. of the city of New York; of which the plaintiff and Seth B. Wigginton were two; that the said bills of exchange were debited to the defendant in the said accounts, as being due from him to the said Richard S. Hackley, and Co. an that the said accounts contained various other articles of debit and credit to a considerable amount, commenced on the day of and continued till the day of when the firm of Richard S. Hackley was changed into that of Richard S. Hackley and Co. and concluded on the day of</p>
<p>That in these accounts, the balance stated to be due from the defendant, to the said Richard S. Hackley, on the day of is transferred, with the consent of the said Richard S. Hackley, to the said Richard S. Hackley and Co. and that the account in which the said balance is so transferred to the said Richard S. Hackley, and Co. and the formation of that firm, were communicated by the said Richard S. Hackley himself to the defendant, before the institution of this suit; and that the defendant thereafter, made to the said Richard S. Hackley, and Co. several remittances in money and commodities, towards the discharge of the said balance, and addressed to them several letters concerning the same, which remittances and letters came to the hands of the said Richard S. Hackley, and Co. Whereupon the defendant moved the court to instruct the jury, that if the balance aforesaid, was transferred as aforesaid to Richard S. Hackley and Co. it was not a subsisting debt from the defendant to the plaintiff alone, at the commencement of this suit. But the court (consisting of Marshall, Ch. J. and Griffin, district judge) overruled the motion, being of opinion that, though the debt was in equity transferred to Richard S. Hackley, and Co. yet the suit was maintainable for their benefit in the name of Richard S. Hackley. At the same time the defendant was permitted to give in evidence, any discounts which he might claim against Richard S. Hackley, and Co.</p>
<p>The second bill of exceptions stated, that the plaintiff to support his action, gave in evidence sundry accounts <span class="star-pagination">*344</span> current between himself, and the defendant in which the plaintiff had credited the defendant, as being in the plaintiff's hands for collection, for the proceeds of a certain quantity of flour, which he had sold for the defendant, but had afterwards charged to the defendant several sums on account of the alleged insolvency of some of the purchasers of the said flour. It also appeared, that in the account current, and accounts of sales, the proceeds of sale of the said flour were stated to be outstanding, subject to collection, and the plaintiff did not undertake to guarantee the debts. Whereupon the defendant, in order to repel that evidence, offered to prove that the sums so charged to the defendant were lost by the mismanagement and misconduct of the plaintiff, in having made the sales to persons known by him to be unworthy of credit; but the court refused to permit such proof to be made to the jury in this action, being of opinion that such misconduct was properly to be inquired into in a suit for that purpose.</p>
<p>This case being submitted without argument, the judgment was affirmed, with costs.</p>

<p class="indent">ERROR to the circuit court of the district of Columbia, sitting at Alexandria.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p2">
<span class="num">2</span>
<p class="indent">This was an action of <i>assumpsit</i>, by Levy, the indorsee of a promissory note, against Gadsby, payee and indorsor of M'Intosh's note.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p3">
<span class="num">3</span>
<p class="indent">The declaration consisted of three counts. The 1st, in addition to the common averments, alleged, that the plaintiff had brought suit upon the note against M'Intosh, in Maryland, and recovered judgment, but that before execution made M'Intosh died insolvent. The 2d <i>count</i> was in the usual form, excepting that it alleged that Gadsby, became liable by the <i>custom of merchants</i>. The 3d <i>count</i> was for money had and received. The defendant pleaded, 1st. <i>Non assumpsit</i>. 2d. As to the first count, usury between M'Intosh and Levy, stating the transaction as a loan, by the latter to the former. 3d. As to the first count, usury between the same parties, stating the transaction as a forbearance of an antecedent debt. The 4th and 5th were like pleas of usury to the 2d count. The 3d and 5th pleas, by mistake, alleged the note given, in pursuance of the corrupt agreement, to be a note made by Gadsby to M'Intosh, and by him indorsed to Levy; whereas, the note in the declaration mentioned, was a note made by M'Intosh to Gadsby, and <i>by him</i> indorsed to Levy. To the pleas of usury, there were general replications and issues, and a general verdict for the defendant. On the trial three bills of exception were taken by the plaintiff.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p4">
<span class="num">4</span>
<p class="indent">1st. The first stated, that the plaintiff gave in evidence, a promissory note in the usual form, dated November 1, 1797, whereby M'Intosh, six months after date, promised to pay to Gadsby, or order, 1,436 dollars, 62 cents, for value received, negotiable at the bank of Alexandria. And it was proved that Levy and M'Intosh carried on trade and commerce in copartnership, under the name and firm of Levy and M'Intosh, at Alexandria, Levy residing at Georgetown, about 8 miles distant from Alexandria. That they so continued to carry on trade and commerce from sometime in the year 1796, till the 12th day of November, 1797, on which day the partnership was dissolved; and that the dissolution was advertised in the public papers, on the 19th of October, 1797, to take place on the said 12th day of November, 1797. And the defendant, to support the issues on his part, offered in evidence, a paper in the hand-writing of the plaintiff, and by him subscribed, as follows:</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p5">
<span class="num">5</span>
<p class="indent">'Georgetown, November 9th, 1797. Received of Mr. John M'Intosh, his two notes, one payable to John Gadsby for fourteen hundred and thirty-six dollars, sixty-two cents, dated the first instant, negotiable at the bank of Alexandria, at six months after date, indorsed by said Gadsby; the other to Thomas J. Beatty, of same date, at three months after date, for twelve hundred and seventy dollars, eighty-seven cents, negotiable at the bank of Columbia, and indorsed by said Beatty. The two notes making the sum of two thousand seven hundred and seven dollars, forty-nine cents, which, when paid, is on account of money due me from the firm of Levy and M'Intosh, equal to two thousand two hundred and ten dollars, twenty-four cents, as by their account, handed me by said M'Intosh, dated October 23d, 1797; and as the said M'Intosh agrees, he is receiving an interest equal to the difference, twixt the sum due me, as per their account current, and the notes payable, he, therefore, allows me the same interest as the one he is receiving for my money. Therefore, on a settlement of accounts, I am only to stand debited for twenty-two hundred and ten dollars, twenty-four cents, $2,210 24 due as per account current; $497 25 interest; $2,707 49.</p>

<p class="indent">The plaintiff's counsel objected to the said writing being given in evidence by the defendant, on the pleas of usury, and the court refused to permit it to go in evidence on those pleas. The plaintiff's counsel then objected to its going in evidence on the general issue of <i>non assumpsit</i>, but upon that issue, the court admitted it.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p8">
<span class="num">8</span>
<p class="indent">2d. The 2d bill of exceptions, after repeating the same facts, states, that the plaintiff's counsel prayed the opinion of the court, and their instruction to the jury, whether the circumstances given in evidence as aforesaid, amounted to proof of an usurious contract between Levy and M'Intosh; and the court, thereupon, instructed the jury, that those circumstances did amount to proof of an usurious contract between those parties.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p9">
<span class="num">9</span>
<p class="indent">3d. The 3d bill of exceptions was to the opinion of the court, that the agreement mentioned in the receipt given by Levy to M'Intosh, having been read in evidence, and having been, by the court, declared an usurious agreement, the note given in pursuance thereof, is void, and that the plaintiff is not entitled to recover thereon, against the defendant, in the present action.</p>

<p class="indent">The questions arising in this case are,</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p12">
<span class="num">12</span>
<p class="indent">1st. Whether the court below was correct in instructing the jury, that the agreement contained in Levy's receipt, was usurious.</p>

<span class="num">14</span>
<p class="indent">3d. Whether it was admissible upon either of the other issues.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p15">
<span class="num">15</span>
<p class="indent"><i>Swann</i>, for plaintiff in error. 1. As to the usury. The court below undertook to say, that the agreement and other circumstances, amounted to conclusive proof of usury, when it ought to have been left to the jury, under all the circumstances of the case, to say whether the contract was usurious or not.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p16">
<span class="num">16</span>
<p class="indent">There appears to have been a partnership in usury, between Levy and M'Intosh. During that partnership, M'Intosh had loaned Levy's money at usury, and on the 23d of October, 1797, was indebted to Levy in the sum of 2,210 dollars, 24 cents, for money thus lent out at 3 and 6 months. And being satisfied that he should receive that money at those periods, he was willing to bind himself absolutely to pay it over to Levy, whose money it in truth was. This, we say, is the true construction of the receipt. It is no more than the case of an agent binding himself to pay over, at a particular time, the money of his principal, which shall at that time be in his hands.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p17">
<span class="num">17</span>
<p class="indent">To constitute usury under the act of assembly, <i>Revised Code of Virginia, p.</i> 37 there must be either a <i>loan</i> of money, or forbearance of a <i>debt</i> already due. In this case there was neither a <i>loan</i> from Levy to M'Intosh, nor a debt due from M'Intosh to Levy. <i>Cowper</i>, 115, <i>Floyer</i> v. <i>Edwards</i>. A note given without consideration is not usurious. M'Intosh was to receive the money at a certain time, and pay it over to Levy. This is the whole of the contract. He only bound himself expressly to do what, in equity and conscience, he ought to do. At the time the notes were given, if Levy had sued M'Intosh for the money, it would have been a sufficient answer to say that M'Intosh had not received it.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p18">
<span class="num">18</span>
<p class="indent">If I authorise a man to lend 1,000 dollars of my money           on usury for my benefit, and he does so, and has           received 500 dollars for such usury, can I not compel           him to pay it over to me? This is really the only           question upon the merits of this case; and this seems to           be decided by the case of <i>Faikney</i> v. <i>Reynous</i>, 4 <i>Burr.</i>           2069, and that of <i>Petrie</i> v. <i>Hannay</i>, 3 <i>T. R.</i> 418, in           which it was held that if two be engaged in a           transaction illegal, but not <i>malum in se</i>, and one of           them pay the whole money, he may recover a proportion from the other, if this other has      expressly promised to pay it. From hence it may be inferred,      that although the original transaction between M'Intosh and      the person to whom he lent the money on usury was illegal,      and although Levy knew all the circumstances, and assented to      the transaction, yet, inasmuch as it was not <i>malum in se</i>, and      M'Intosh agreed to pay over the money to Levy when received,      the illegality of the original transaction shall not      discharge M'Intosh from such agreement, or render it void.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p19">
<span class="num">19</span>
<p class="indent"><i>Simms</i>, on the same side. An objection was made in the court below, to allowing usury to be given in evidence on the plea of <i>non assumpsit</i>, but it was overruled by the court. If there had been no other plea, perhaps the question would be doubtful; but when the defendant has pleaded usury in a particular way, he ought not to be permitted to resort to a different kind of usury. <i>Tate</i> v. <i>Wellings</i>, 3 <i>T. R.</i> 538. It tends to surprise and entrap the plaintiff.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p20">
<span class="num">20</span>
<p class="indent"><i>C. Lee</i>, contra.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p21">
<span class="num">21</span>
<p class="indent">1st. Whether usury can be given in evidence on <i>non assumpsit</i>.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p22">
<span class="num">22</span>
<p class="indent">Every thing which goes to show that the contract is void, may be given in evidence on that plea; for if the promise was void when made, then, in law, it was no promise. <i>Str.</i> 498, <i>Bernard</i> v. <i>Saul</i>. 2 <i>Str.</i> 733, <i>Burrows</i> v. <i>Jemino</i>. 1 <i>Esp. Rep.</i> 178.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p23">
<span class="num">23</span>
<p class="indent">There being two special pleas of usury makes no difference, the court having been of opinion that the evidence did not support those pleas.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p24">
<span class="num">24</span>
<p class="indent">2d. As to the construction of the agreement. If the usury is reserved for forbearance of a debt already due, it is the same thing as if reserved on an original loan. 1 <i>Call</i>, 74, 81, <i>Gibson</i> v. <i>Fristoe</i>. And it makes no difference whether the usurious interest is stated to be received from others or not. Usury is not to be covered by such devises as that. It is only an indirect way of receiving the usury.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p25">
<span class="num">25</span>
<p class="indent">No argument can make the transaction plainer, than it is stated in the receipt itself. <i>Res ipsa loquitur</i>.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p26">
<span class="num">26</span>
<p class="indent"><i>Mason</i>, on the same side. There can be no ground for the plaintiff to allege surprise in the admission of the receipt as evidence on the general issue. The special pleas set forth precisely the same facts, and nothing but a blunder in copying the pleas, and inserting the name of M'Intosh for Gadsby, prevented the evidence from being admitted on those pleas.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p27">
<span class="num">27</span>
<p class="indent">The agreement is, that as M'Intosh is receiving usury from others, therefore he will pay it to the plaintiff. If the debtor receives usury from <i>his</i> debtors, it is no justification of the creditor in demanding from him.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p28">
<span class="num">28</span>
<p class="indent">There is no evidence that the partnership of Levy and M'Intosh was a partnership in usury.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p29">
<span class="num">29</span>
<p class="indent">The receipt does not directly aver that M'Intosh is receiving the rate of interest mentioned. It only states that he <i>agrees</i> he is receiving it. A man may <i>agree</i> to a false statement of facts; and, indeed, that is always the case, when usury is attempted to be covered.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p30">
<span class="num">30</span>
<p class="indent"><i>Jones</i>, on the same side. The evidence offered was not only applicable to the general issue, but to the first special plea of usury. The agreement shows it to be a <i>loan</i> in the sense of the statute.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p31">
<span class="num">31</span>
<p class="indent">No precedent can be found of a plea of usury which does not state it as a loan.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p32">
<span class="num">32</span>
<p class="indent">The cases cited do not apply. The agreement itself does not state it to be accounting for profits received. But M'Intosh gives an absolute note for the payment of money, although it is agreed that it is outstanding.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p33">
<span class="num">33</span>
<p class="indent">The question is upon a written agreement, and the construction of all such agreements is exclusively with the court.</p>

<div class="num" id="p34">
<span class="num">34</span>
<p class="indent">MARSHALL, Ch. J. delivered the opinion of the court.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p35">
<span class="num">35</span>
<p class="indent">It was slightly contended by the counsel for the plaintiff in error, that when usury has been specially pleaded, and the evidence adduced to support such plea has been adjudged by the court to be inapplicable to the facts so pleaded, the same evidence cannot be admitted upon the plea of <i>non assumpsit</i>. No cases in support of this position have been cited, and it does not appear to be supported by reasoning from analogy. In cases where there are special and general counts in a declaration, and the evidence does not support the special counts, the plaintiff is allowed to apply the same evidence in support of the general counts. On a parity of reasoning, the defendant should be permitted to give in evidence upon the plea of <i>non assumpsit</i>, the same facts which were adjudged inapplicable to the special pleas, but which might have been received on the general plea, if the special pleas had not been pleaded.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p36">
<span class="num">36</span>
<p class="indent">The counsel for the plaintiff has also contended, that although the paper-writing produced would, on the face of it, import a usurious contract, yet, as the jury might possibly have inferred from it certain extrinsic facts, which would have shown the contract not to have been within the act, the jury ought to have been left at liberty to infer those facts. But in this case the question arises upon, a written instrument, and no principle is more clearly settled, than that the construction of a written evidence is exclusively with the court.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p37">
<span class="num">37</span>
<p class="indent">This court is of opinion, that the court below has correctly construed the instrument upon which the question arose, and that, therefore, there is no error in the judgment.</p>

<p class="parties">THE MARINE INSURANCE COMPANY OF ALEXANDRIA<br/>v.<br/>WILSON.<a class="footnote" href="#fn-s" id="fn-s_ref">*</a></p>
<p class="date">February Term, 1805</p>
<div class="prelims">
<p class="indent">THIS was an action of covenant in the circuit court of the district of Columbia, sitting at Alexandria, brought by Wilson, the defendant in error, against the Marine Insurance Company of Alexandria, upon a policy of insurance on the brig George, from Alexandria to Havrede-Grace, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="indent">One of the clauses in the policy was in the following words, viz. 'If the above vessel, after a regular survey, shall be condemned for being unsound or rotten, the underwriters shall not be bound to pay the subscription on this policy.' The declaration was for a total loss, and averred, that the brig sailed from Alexandria, on the 24th of October, 1802, upon the voyage insured.</p>
<p class="indent">The defendants pleaded,</p>
<p class="indent">1st. 'That on the 24th day of October, 1802, the said brigantine, called the George, was unsound in her timbers, and by reason of the said unsoundness, was not capable of performing the voyage in the policy mentioned, viz. at and from Alexandria aforesaid, across the Atlantic ocean to Havre-de-Grace, Rotterdam or Bremen, with liberty to call at Falmouth for orders, and this they are ready to verify,' &amp;c.</p>
<p class="indent">2d. 'That after the said brigantine had gone from Alexandria aforesaid, upon the voyage aforesaid, and while she was proceeding upon the voyage aforesaid, upon the high seas, she sprung aleak, viz. on the 31st day of October, in the year aforesaid, in consequence of her not having been tight, staunch and strong enough for performing the voyage aforesaid, on the said 24th day of October, in the year aforesaid, at Alexandria aforesaid, and, at the instance of her crew, her voyage was interrupted upon account of her incapacity to perform the same. And the said brigantine was put back and conducted into a convenient port to be examined and repaired, viz. into Norfolk in Virginia, and that a regular survey of the said brigantine was made at Norfolk on the ___ day of _____ in the year _____ and thereupon the said brigantine was condemned for being unsound to that degree as not to be worthy of being repaired, and rendered fit and able to perform the voyage aforesaid, whereof the plaintiff afterwards, to wit, on the day and year last mentioned, at the county of Alexandria aforesaid, had notice, and this they are ready to verify,' &amp;c.</p>
<p class="indent">To this last plea there was, at first, a general demurrer, which was afterwards withdrawn, and general replications and issues to both pleas.</p>
<p class="indent">On the trial, two bills of exception were taken by the defendants. The first states, that the defendants moved the court to instruct the jury to find a verdict for the defendants, if they should be satisfied by the testimony that the George, on the 24th of October, 1802, after a regular survey, <i>was condemned</i> as being unsound or rotten by the surveyors, whose report is as follows, to wit, 'The brig George, of Alexandria, Caspar Hayman, master, having put into this port in distress, we, the subscribers, at the request of said master, did this day attend on board, for the purpose of ascertaining and reporting the situation of the said vessel, and the circumstances of said distress. We found, from the report of said master, and others, that they sailed from Alexandria on the 24th of October last past, with a cargo of tobacco, coffee and staves, bound on a voyage to Falmouth, in England; that on the 31st of the same month, in consequence of having met with heavy gales of wind, the vessel sprung aleak, and that with much difficulty and continued labour at the pumps, having seldom less than three feet water in the hold, they gained this port. Considering the foregoing circumstances, and the appearances which, in our minds, confirm the same, we think proper to recommend that the vessel be hauled to some convenient wharf, the cargo landed, and the hull carefully examined. Given under our hands at Norfolk, Virginia, 17th November, 1802.</p>
<p class="indent">JAMES HUNTER,</p>
<p class="indent">PAUL PROBY.'</p>
<p class="indent">'The cargo of the brig George, of Alexandria, having been unladen, pursuant to a recommendation contained in a report, dated the 17th instant, and signed by two of the present subscribers, we, the undersigned, at the request of Caspar Hayman, master of said brig, did this day attend on board for the purpose expressed in said report.</p>
<p class="indent">'We find, on a minute examination of the hull of said vessel, that without going into an extensive repair, the intended voyage cannot be prosecuted; and, considering the heavy expense that must necessarily attend such a measure, and which, in our opinion, would exceed the value of the vessel when completed, we are clearly of opinion, that the vessel and materials, in their present state, should be immediately sold on account of those concerned. Given under our hands at Norfolk, Virginia, this 26th Nov. 1802.</p>

<p class="indent">JOHN JARVIS,</p>
<p class="indent">THOS. NASH, <i>Master Carpenters</i>.'</p>
<p class="indent">But the court refused to give the instruction as prayed.</p>
<p class="indent">The second bill of exceptions stated, that the defendants' counsel moved the court to instruct the jury to find a verdict for the defendants, if they should be satisfied by the testimony, that the brig George, after a regular survey, was condemned as having been unsound or rotten on the 24th day of October, 1802, by the surveyors, whose report is as follows: (here was inserted the same report) and shall also be satisfied by the evidence, that the said vessel, while she was performing the voyage insured upon the high seas, sprung aleak on the 31st day of October, in the year aforesaid, and at the instance of her crew, the said voyage was interrupted upon account of her incapacity to perform the said voyage; and that the said brigantine was put back, and conducted into a convenient port to be examined, namely, into Norfolk in Virginia, where the survey herein before-mentioned, was made; but the court refused to give such instruction.</p>
<p class="indent"><i>C. Lee</i>, for plaintiffs in error. Three points arise in this cause.</p>
<p class="indent">1st. That the report of the surveyors is conclusive upon the question of seaworthiness, unless partiality, corruption, or misbehaviour on the part of the surveyors, in making the survey, can be shown.</p>
<p class="indent">2d. That it is competent for the defendant to explain, by parol testimony, the grounds upon which the surveyors condemned the vessel.</p>
<p class="indent">3d. That it was not necessary for the insurers to plead specially the report of the surveyors, and their condemnation of the vessel, but that it might be given in evidence.</p>
<p class="indent">1st. If the parties have agreed upon a tribunal to decide a particular question, they must be bound by the decision of that tribunal. So in the case of an award. It is binding upon the parties all over the world.</p>
<p class="indent">But, it may be said, how are the surveyors to ascertain the condition of the vessel on the 24th of October? The answer is, that they might examine witnesses; they might judge from the universal decay of the timbers, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="indent">The covenant in the policy does not say at what time the vessel must be proved to have been unsound. But we admit, that she must be proved to have been unsound at the time the voyage commenced.</p>
<p class="indent">We pleaded, that she was unsound on the 24th of October, when the voyage commenced; and we prayed the court to instruct the jury, that if they should be satisfied by the evidence that she was <i>condemned</i> as being unsound and rotten on the 24th of October, after a regular survey, they ought to find a verdict for the defendants. This instruction, we contend, the court ought to have given; for the report of the surveyors is like an award of arbitrators, which cannot be set aside, unless partiality, fraud, or misbehaviour be proved on the part of the arbitrators. In the case of <i>Shelton</i> v. <i>Barbour</i>, 2 <i>Wash.</i> 64, it was held, that a former verdict and judgment between the mother of the plaintiff, who sued for his freedom, and the defendant, by which it was adjudged that the mother was a slave, were conclusive evidence that the plaintiff, her son, was a slave. And this was in a question where freedom was concerned, and where the natural leaning of the court is presumed to be in favour of freedom.</p>
<p class="indent">The judgment of a court is to be admitted as conclusive evidence, without being specially pleaded. So is an award, and the judgment of a foreign court which has jurisdiction over the subject matter and the parties.</p>
<p class="indent">2d. If the report of the surveyors does not refer to the 24th of October, as the time when the vessel was unsound, it was competent for us to explain the report by testimony not inconsistent with it. There is, however, enough in the report to induce a presumption that she was not sound on the 24th. The unsoundness was in the <i>hull</i>, not in the rigging, masts, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="indent">To show that parol testimony might be admitted to explain any ambiguity of the report, the following cases were cited: 1. <i>T. R.</i> 701, <i>Doe, dem.

<p class="indent">It does not appear upon the record that any other evidence was offered to prove the vessel unsound on the 24th of October, than the report of the surveyors. No parol testimony appears to have been offered to explain the report, or to apply it to the time of commencing the risk. The bill of exceptions is repugnant. It asks an opinion predicated upon the unsoundness of the vessel on the 24th of October, and relies upon the report of the surveyors, which applies only to the 31st of October. If it was intended to bring before this court the propriety of admitting parol evidence to explain the report, that question does not appear to arise from the record.</p>
<p class="indent">I see no reason for reversing the judgment.</p>
<p class="indent">I do not, however, mean to be understood, that if parol evidence had been offered, it would have been proper to receive it. I give no opinion upon that point.</p>
<p class="indent">PATERSON, J.</p>
<p class="indent">No parol evidence appears upon the record to show that the report of the surveyors referred to the 24th of October. The conclusiveness of the report, therefore, did not come before the court. It is not a point in the cause.</p>

<p class="indent">This is an action on a policy of insurance. The defence set up is, that the vessel was unsound and rotten on the 24th of October, when the risk commenced; and it is alleged that the report of the surveyors is conclusive evidence of that fact.

<center><h1>WILSON<br/>
v.<br/>
CODMAN's EXECUTOR.<sup>[*]</sup></h1></center>
<center><p><b>Supreme Court of United States.</b></p></center>
<center></center>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*197</span> E.J. Lee, for plaintiff in error, made the following points.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*206</span> MARSHALL, Ch. J. delivered the opinion of the court.</p>
<p>The first question which presents itself in this case is, was the defendant entitled to oyer of the letters testamentary at the term succeeding that at which the executor was admitted a plaintiff in the cause?</p>
<p>It is contended, on the part of the defendant, that on the suggestion of the death of either plaintiff or defendant, a scire facias ought to issue, in order to bring in his representative; or, if a scire facias should not be required, yet, that the opposite party should have the same time to plead and make a proper defence as if such process had been actually sued.</p>
<p>The words of the act of congress do not seem to countenance this opinion. They contemplate the coming in of the executor as a voluntary act, and give the scire facias to bring him in, if it shall be necessary, and to enable the court "to render such judgment against the estate of the <span class="star-pagination">*207</span> deceased party," "as if the executor or administrator had voluntarily made himself a party to the suit." From the language of the act this may be done instanter. The opinion, that it is to be done on motion, and that the party may immediately proceed to trial, derives strength from the provision, that the executor or administrator, so becoming a party, may have one continuance. This provision shows, that the legislature supposed the circumstance of making the executor a party to the suit, to be no cause of delay. But as the executor might require time to inform himself of the proper defence, one continuance was allowed him for that purpose. The same reason not extending to the other party, the same indulgence is not extended to him.</p>
<p>There is, then, nothing in the act, nor is there any thing in the nature of the provision, which should induce an opinion, that any delay is to be occasioned where the executor makes himself a party and is ready to go to trial. Â— Unquestionably, he must show himself to be executor, unless the fact be admitted by the parties; and the defendant may insist on the production of his letters testamentary, before he shall be permitted to prosecute; but if the order for his admission, as a party, be made, it is too late to contest the fact of his being an executor.</p>
<p>If the court has unguardedly permitted a person to prosecute who has not given satisfactory evidence of his right to do so, it possesses the means of preventing any mischief from the inadvertence, and will undoubtedly employ those means.</p>
<p>The second point in the case is the demurrer of the defendant to the plaintiff's replication.</p>
<p>Two causes of demurrer are assigned. 1st. That it is a departure from the declaration. 2d. That the plea ought to have been traversed, and an issue tendered thereon.</p>
<p>On the first cause of demurrer, some difference has existed in the court, but the majority of the judges concur in the opinion, that the replication fortifies, and does not depart from the declaration.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*208</span> The averment, that the assignment was for value received, is an immaterial averment. The assignee, without value, can as well maintain his action as the assignee, on a valuable consideration. It is, therefore, mere surplusage, and does not require to be proved; nor does it affect the substantial part of the declaration. It is also the opinion of a part of the court, that the duty created by the trust, and which was discharged by the assignment, may be considered as constituting a valuable consideration to support the averment, and prevent the replication from being a departure from the declaration.</p>
<p>2d. The second cause of demurrer is clearly not maintainable. The matter of the replication does not deny, but avoids the allegations of the plea, and, consequently, the conclusion to the court is proper.</p>
<p>It has, indeed, been argued, that the replication is faulty, because it does not confess the matter alleged in the plea; but this is not assigned as a cause of demurrer, and it is, therefore, not noticed by the court.</p>
<p>The demurrer having been overruled, several exceptions were taken at the trial to the opinion of the court.</p>
<p>The first was to the admission of the note as evidence. This was objected to, because the declaration averred the note to be assigned for value received, and the assignment contained no expression of a valuable consideration, but was declared to be made "without recourse." As the assignment is not set forth in hÂœc verba, this exception is so clearly unmaintainable that it will require only to be mentioned.</p>
<p>The 2d exception requires more consideration. It is, that although the averment that the assignment was made for value received was immaterial, yet the plaintiff, having stated the fact in his declaration, is bound to prove it. In support of this position, Bristow v. Wright, Doug. 665, has been quoted and relied on.</p>
<p>The strictness with which, in England, a plaintiff is bound to prove the averments of his declaration, although <span class="star-pagination">*209</span> they may be immaterial, seems to have relaxed from its original rigour.</p>
<p>The reasons stated by Lord Mansfield, in the case reported by Douglas, for adhering to the rule, do not apply in the United States, where costs are not affected by the length of the declaration.</p>
<p>Examining the subject with a view to the great principles of justice, and to those rules which are calculated for the preservation of right and the prevention of injury, no reason is perceived for requiring the proof of a perfectly immaterial averment, unless that averment be descriptive of a written instrument, which, by being untruly described, may, by possibility, mislead the opposite party.</p>
<p>Where, then, the averment in the declaration is of a fact dehors the written contract, which fact is in itself immaterial, it is the opinion of the court that the party making the averment, is not bound to prove it.</p>
<p>In this case, the averment, that the assignment was made for value received, is the averment of a fact, which is perfectly immaterial, and which forms no part of the written assignment; nor is it averred to be a part of it. It is an extrinsic fact, showing how the right of action was acquired, but which contributes nothing towards giving that right of action. The party making this useless averment ought not to be bound to prove it.</p>
<p>No case which has been cited at bar, comes up to this. The averments of the declaration, which the plaintiff has been required to prove, are all descriptive of records, or of written contracts; not of a fact, at the same time extrinsic and immaterial. The court is, therefore, unanimous in the opinion, that this exception cannot be maintained.</p>
<p>In the progress of the trial, the counsel for the defendant, in the court below, also required that court to instruct the jury, that unless the plaintiff could show that the Ramsays, who were his agents, had the power <span class="star-pagination">*210</span> to collect some other debt from the defendant, the payments made by him, to them, should be credited on the notes given to them in trust for Codman, which instruction the court very properly refused to give.</p>
<p>Independent of the proof made by the plaintiff, that the sums of money received by the Ramsays from Wilson, were really on their own account, the instruction would not have been proper as this case actually stood. There was a running account between the Ramsays and Wilson, who had large transactions with each other, and who reciprocally advanced large sums. This running account is not stated by the defendant, in the proposition for the opinion of the court. The effect it produces, is to make it proper for Wilson to prove, that advances made by him to the Ramsays, were not designed to satisfy their particular engagements with each other, but were intended to discharge the debt due to Codman. Terms are improperly used in the bill, which imply a fact contradicted by the testimony. The word payment is used instead of the word advance, and this, at first view, may produce an obscurity, which is dissipated on investigating the record.</p>
<p>The judgment is to be affirmed with costs.</p>

<p class="indent">THIS was a writ of error to 'The court for the trial of impeachments and correction of errors, in the state of New-York,' under the act of congress, of the 24<i>th September</i>, 1789, Â§ 25, <i>vol.</i> 1, <i>p.</i> 63, which gives the supreme court of the United States, appellate jurisdiction upon a judgment in the highest court of a state, in which a decision in the suit could be had, where is drawn in question, the construction of any clause of a statute of the United States, and the decision is against the right, privilege or exemption, specially set up or claimed by either party, under such statute.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p2">
<span class="num">2</span>
<p class="indent">The action was upon a policy of insurance, and the only question to be decided by this court was, whether the risk insured was illegal, under the act of congress (commonly called the <i>non-intercourse</i> law) <i>of the</i> 13<i>th June</i>, 1798, <i>vol.</i> 4, <i>p.</i> 129. For, although another question appears to arise upon the record, viz. whether a condemnation in a foreign court, as enemy's property, be conclusive evidence of that fact, yet this court is prohibited by the same 25th section of the act of 1789, to consider any other question than that which respects the construction of the statute in dispute.</p>

<div class="num" id="p3">
<span class="num">3</span>
<p class="indent">On the trial of the general issue, a special verdict was found, containing the following facts:</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p4">
<span class="num">4</span>
<p class="indent">That on the 27th day of April, 1799, the defendants, for a premium of 25 per cent, insured for the plaintiffs, <i>against all risks</i>, 1,000 dollars, upon twenty-five thousand pounds weight of coffee, valued at 20 cents per pound, on board the sloop Nancy, from Hispaniola to St. Thomas. That in the margin of the policy was inserted a clause in the following words: 'warranted the property of the plaintiffs, all Americans,' but that the words <i>all Americans</i>, were added after the policy was subscribed; that the sloop Nancy was built at Rhode-Island, and belonged to citizens of the United States, resident in Rhode-Island, as well when she left that state as at the time of her capture, and, being chartered by the plaintiffs, sailed from New-Port, in Rhode-Island, on the 12th day of December, in the year 1798, on her first voyage to the Havanna; that in the course of the said voyage, she was compelled, being in distress, to put into Cape-Francois, in the island of Hispaniola, a country in the possession of France, where she arrived on the 5th day of January, 1799; that the captain and supercargo of the sloop were part owners of the Cargo, and are two of the plaintiffs in this suit; that having so put into Cape-Francois, the cargo was landed to repair the vessel; that the public officers, acting under the French government there, took from them nearly all the provisions on board the sloop, and the captain and supercargo were permitted to sell, and did sell, the remainder to different persons there; that the captain and supercargo made a contract with the public officers, by which, they were to be paid for the provisions in thirty days, but the payment was not made; that, with the proceeds of the remaining parts of the cargo, they purchased the whole of the cargo which was on board at the time of the capture, and also seventeen hogsheads of sugar, which they sent home to New-York, on freight; that the said officers <i>forbade</i> the said master and supercargo of the sloop, from taking on board the cargo landed from the said vessel, or from conveying from the said island any specie, by reason whereof, they were <i>compelled</i> to sell the same, and to take the produce of that country in payment; that the sloop, with thirty thousand weight of coffee on board, twenty-five thousand pounds weight of which was intended to be insured by the present policy, sailed from Cape-Francois, on the 23d day of February, in the year last aforesaid, on the voyage mentioned in the policy of insurance, having on board the usual documents of an American vessel; that the sloop, in the course of her said voyage, was captured by a British frigate, and carried into the island of Tortola, and vessel and cargo libelled, as well for being the property of the enemies of Great-Britain, as for being the property of American citizens, trading contrary to the laws of the United States; that, at the time of the capture of the sloop, besides the documents aforesaid, the following paper was found on board: 'Liberty, Safe Conduct, Equalityâ€”At the Cape, 11th Thermidor, sixty year of French Republic, one and indivisible. The General of division and private agent of the Executive Directory at St. Domingo, requests the officers of the French navy and privateers of the Republic, to let pass freely the American vessel called the master, property of Mr. E. Born Jenks, merchants at Providence, state of Rhode-Island, in the United States, arrived from the said place to the Cape-Francois, for trade and business. The Citizen French Consul, in the place where the said vessel shall be fitted out, is invited to fill with her name, and the captain's, the blank left on these presents; in attestation of which he will please to set his hand hereupon.</p>

<p class="indent">which paper was received on board the sloop at Cape-Francois, and was on board when she left that place; that the property insured by the policy aforesaid, was claimed by the said Zebedee Hunt, and was condemned by a sentence of the said court of Vice-Admiralty, in the following words: 'that the said sloop Nancy, and cargo on board, claimed by the said Zebedee Hunt, as by the proceedings, will show to be enemy's property, and as such, or otherwise, liable to confiscation, and condemned the same as good and lawful prize to the captors.'

</div>
<div class="num" id="p8">
<span class="num">8</span>
<p class="indent">That part of the act of congress, which the underwriters contended had been violated by the defendants in error, is as follows:</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p9">
<span class="num">9</span>
<p class="indent">Sec. 1. <i>Be it enacted</i>, &amp;c. 'that no ship or vessel, owned, hired or employed, wholly or in part, by any person resident within the United States, and which shall depart therefrom after the first day of July next, shall be allowed to proceed, directly, or from any intermediate port or place, to any port or place within the territory of the French republic, or the dependencies thereof, or to any place in the West-Indies, or elsewhere, under the acknowledged government of France, <i>or shall be employed in any traffic or commerce with or for any person resident within the jurisdiction or under the authority of the French republic</i>. And if any ship or vessel, in any voyage thereafter commencing, and before her return within the United States, shall be voluntarily carried, or suffered to proceed to any French port or place as aforesaid, <i>or shall be employed as aforesaid</i>, contrary to the intent hereof, every such ship or vessel, together with her cargo, shall be forfeited, and shall accrue,' &amp; c.</p>

<p class="indent">Sec. 2, enacts, that atter the first of July, 1798, no clearance for a foreign voyage shall be granted to any ship or vessel, owned, hired or employed, wholly or in part, by any person resident within the United States, until a bond shall be given, in a sum equal to the value of the vessel and cargo, '<i>with condition</i>, that the same shall not, during her intended voyage, or before her return within the United States, proceed or be carried, directly or indirectly, to any port or place within the territory of the French republic, or the dependencies thereof, or any place in the West-Indies, or elsewhere, under the acknowledged government of France, <i>unless by distress of weather, or want of provisions, or by actual force or violence</i>, to be fully proved and manifested before the acquittance of such bond; and such such vessel is not, and shall not be employed, during her intended voyage, or before her return, as aforesaid, <i>in any traffic or commerce with or for any person resident within the territory of that republic, or in any of the dependencies thereof.'

<p class="indent"><i>Mason</i>, for the plaintiffs in error. If the insurance was upon an illegal transaction, the defendants in error have no right to recover. The only question for the consideration of this court is, whether it be a transaction prohibited by the act of congress. If the purchase of this cargo in <i>Cape-Francois</i> was lawful, the policy is good.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p12">
<span class="num">12</span>
<p class="indent">The first section of the act has two branches, and contemplates two separate offencesâ€”1st. That no vessel shall be allowed to go to a French port. But this prohibition must be subject to the general principle, that the act of God, or of the public enemy, shall be an excuse.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p13">
<span class="num">13</span>
<p class="indent">2d. That if driven into such port by distress, or involuntarily carried in, yet, there shall be no trade or traffic.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p14">
<span class="num">14</span>
<p class="indent">The words are, 'if any vessel shall be <i>voluntarily</i> carried, or suffered to proceed to any French port or place as aforesaid, <i>or shall be employed as aforesaid</i>.' The <i>going in</i> must be <i>voluntary</i>, but the legislature carefully omit the word <i>voluntarily</i>, when speaking of the offence of trading; for all trading must be voluntary; it cannot be by compulsion. The object was to prevent intercourse, and the statute only makes the same saving of the forfeiture, which a court would have been without such a saving clause.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p15">
<span class="num">15</span>
<p class="indent">The condition of the bond mentioned in the 2d section, confirms this construction of the 1st. It is divided into two clauses, agreeably to the two offences to be provided against. The proviso, '<i>unless by distress of weather</i>,' &amp;c. is annexed only to the offence of going into the port, but there is no savings or exception as to the offence of trading.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p16">
<span class="num">16</span>
<p class="indent">If she had not been driven in by distress of weather, she would have been liable to forfeiture under the first offence. But having been employed in traffic with persons resident, &amp;c. she is equally liable to forfeiture under the second, and the condition of the bond has been substantially broken.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p17">
<span class="num">17</span>
<p class="indent">The special verdict states, 'that the captain and supercargo were permitted to sell, and did sell the residue of the cargo to different persons there.' Here was no compulsion. This selling was a violation of the law; but it is not that which avoids this policy. The fault was, that with the proceeds of those sales, the plaintiffs below purchased the cargo insured. There was no compulsion to do this, except what I shall presently notice, as stated in the verdict. It will robaby be contended that the following words of the verdict show a compulsion, viz. 'that the said officers forbade the said master and supercargo from taking on board the cargo landed from the said vessel, or from conveying from the said island any specie, by <i>reason whereof</i>, they were <i>compelled</i> to sell the same, and to take the produce of that country in payment.' But this is only the reasoning of the jury, and the words, <i>by reason whereof</i>, show what kind of compulsion it was, and that it was not that inevitable necessity which can excuse the express violation of the law. The owners ought to have said to them, if you forbid us to take away or our property, we must leave it, and look to our government for an indemnification; for they have forbidden us to sell it to you, or to purchase a new cargo. The forbidding them to relade their goods, and to take away specie, was no compulsion to purchase produce. The verdict does not state that the master or supercargo attempted to resist the force; it may be wholly a colourable transaction.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p18">
<span class="num">18</span>
<p class="indent"><i>The act of the</i> 27<i>th February</i>, 1800, <i>vol.</i> 5, <i>p.</i> 15, shows what the construction of that of 1798 ought to be. The 3d section of the former provides, that in case the vessel shall be compelled, by distress or superior force, to go into a French port, and shall there necessarily unlade and deliver, or shall be deprived of any cargo then on board, the master may receive payment in bills of exchange, money or buillion, and not otherwise, 'and shall not thereby be understood to contravene this law.'</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p19">
<span class="num">19</span>
<p class="indent">This is a clear implication, that if there had not been such an express permission to receive payment in bills of exchange, money or bullion, it would have been a contravention of the law; and that law, excepting this provision, is substantially the same as the law of 1798.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p20">
<span class="num">20</span>
<p class="indent"><i>Harper</i>, contra. I might safely agree to the first position taken by the opposite counsel, that the 1st section of the act of 1798 creates two distinct offences. But this is not so. The whole constitutes but one offence.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p21">
<span class="num">21</span>
<p class="indent">How is a ship to be employed in traffic? She must bring and carry. If she did not go voluntarily, she was not employed in trafficking. If the master sell the cargo, under such circumstances, the <i>vessel</i> is not employed in traffic.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p22">
<span class="num">22</span>
<p class="indent">But if the act creates two separate offences, how is the <i>vessel</i> employed in the traffic? She did not carry the cargo there voluntarily. But it being there, and <i>landed, necessarily</i> landed, how is the <i>vessel</i> concerned in the sales and purchases made by the master? The necessity of repairing the vessel is as much an excuse for landing the cargo, as stress of weather was for going in. The master was forbidden to relade it. But a difference is taken between <i>prohibition</i> and <i>prevention</i>. It is said that the <i>forbidding</i> is not <i>preventing</i>. But by whom was the prohibition? by the officers of the government, having authority and power to carry the prohibition into effect. It was, therefore, actual prevention.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p23">
<span class="num">23</span>
<p class="indent">What was the mischief intended to be remedied by the act of congress? Not such a sale as this. It was to prevent a <i>voluntary</i> intercourse, not to prevent citizens of the United States from rescuing their property from impending loss. What is traffic? A contract by consent of both parties. If one is under compulsion, it is no contract, no traffic. The transaction disclosed by the verdict is only the means of saving property from a total loss. The owners were not obliged to abandon, as the gentleman contends, property thus put in jeopardy. The master and supercargo were not free agents. They were not obliged to take bills which they knew would not be paid. If I could have had a doubt upon this case, it would have been removed by the decisions of the circuit courts of the United States. In a case before one of your honours,<a class="footnote" href="#fn-s" id="fn-s_ref">*</a> in Baltimore, a vessel had brought home from the French West-Indies a cargo of the produce of those islands, after having been compelled to go in and sell her outward cargo; and it was decided, that the case was not within this act of congress. A similar case is understood to have been decided by another of your honours,  in New-York. If those cases were not within the law, I am warranted in saying this is not.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p24">
<span class="num">24</span>
<p class="indent">Those decisions produced the 3d section of the act of 1800, which the gentleman has cited, and which was introduced to shut the door that had been left open. It was perceived, that the law, as it stood before, would give an opportunity of fraud. The 3d section was enacted to take away the temptation; because, although there might be cases clear of fraud, it was thought best to sacrifice these particular cases, that fraud might be prevented in others. This section, therefore, has given a sanction to the decisions of the circuit courts.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p25">
<span class="num">25</span>
<p class="indent"><i>Key</i>, in reply. It is clear, that there are two distinct prohibitions in the act. The two parts of the section are connected by the disjunctive 'or,' and not by the copulative, 'and.' This is rendered still more evident by the form of the condition of the bond described in the 2d section.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p26">
<span class="num">26</span>
<p class="indent">Whenever you rely on the necessity of the case to justify your acts, you must not go beyond the necessity. All beyond is voluntary. In this case it might go to the landing, and to the seizure of part, but not to the sale of the residue. The probability of loss is not necessity. If they took produce, it was only to avoid a greater loss. It was not an inevitable necessity.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p27">
<span class="num">27</span>
<p class="indent">Another fact shows that it was <i>trading</i>, not merely taking on board, to bring home, property which they were compelled to receive. She was not coming home with the property when she was captured, but going on a trading voyage. And the French pass states, that she came to Cape Francois for <i>trade and business</i>.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p28">
<span class="num">28</span>
<p class="indent">The intention of the act was to prevent all trading and intercourse with France or her dependencies.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p29">

<p class="indent">In the case at Baltimore, before his honour, Judge <i>Washington</i>, the vessel returned directly home to Baltimore with produce, which she had been compelled to take or abandon.</p>

If the sloop had arrived safe at the Havanna, and been there sold to an agent of the French government, it is clear she would have been liable to forfeiture. So, if the French agent, who signed the passport, had freighted the vessel.</p>

<p class="indent">These cases show, that a pre-existing intention is not necessary. The construction contended for would, indeed, open a wide door to fraud, as the gentleman has contended. It would only be necessary to start a plank in sight of the port, and then go in to stop the leak, and the whole law is evaded.</p>

<p class="indent">MARSHALL, Ch. J. delivered the opinion of the court, to the following effect:</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p33">
<span class="num">33</span>
<p class="indent">The court is of opinion, according to the best consideration they have been able to give the subject, that this case is not within the act of congress of 1798, usually called the non-intercourse law.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p34">
<span class="num">34</span>
<p class="indent">It is contended by the counsel for the defendant, that the circumstances, stated in the special verdict, do not show an absolute necessity for the trading therein described. And it is said, the plaintiff might have abandoned the property, and sought redress of his government; and that it was his duty to do so, rather than violate the laws of his country. But the court is of opinion, that the act of congress did not impose such terms upon a person who was forced by stress of weather to enter a French port, and land his cargo, and was prevented by the public officers of that port to relade and carry it away.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p35">
<span class="num">35</span>
<p class="indent">Even if an actual and general war had existed between this country and France, and the plaintiff had been driven into a French port, a part of his cargo seized, and he had been permitted by the officers of the port to sell the residue, and purchase a new cargo, I am of opinion, that it would not have been deemed such a traffic with the enemy as would vitiate the policy upon such new cargo.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p36">
<span class="num">36</span>
<p class="indent">The terms of the act of congress seem to imply an intentional offence on the part of the owners.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p37">
<span class="num">37</span>
<p class="indent">The case put of a French agent going to the Havanna, and there purchasing the cargo for the use of the French government, under a pre-concert with the owners, would certainly be an offence against the law; but when there is no such intention; when the vessel has been absolutely forced, by stress of weather, to go into a French port, and land her cargo; when part has been seized for the use of the government of France, and the master has been forbidden by the public officers of the port to relade the residue, and to sell it for any thing valuable, except the produce of the country, the mere taking away such produce cannot be deemed such a traffic as is contemplated by the act of congress.</p>

<p class="date">February Term, 1805</p>
<div class="prelims">
<p class="indent">ERROR to the circuit court for the district of Georgia, in chancery sitting.</p>
<p class="indent">The object of the bill was to recover from the defendants, as legatees and devisees of George Galphin, deceased, a debt due by him to the complainant's intestate, as surviving partner of Clark and Milligan. The bill charges, that Clark and Milligan were merchants in London; that Milligan survived Clark, and that the complainant is the administrator of Milligan, the survivor; that in the year 1770, they supplied George Galphin with goods; that in 1773, George Galphin requested them by letter to supply goods to his three sons, Thomas, George and John, his nephew David Holmes, and John Parkinson, under the firm of Galphin and Holmes; that on the credit of G. Galphin, the elder, they shipped goods, &amp;c. to the said company.</p>
<p class="indent">That in 1776, G. Galphin, the elder, wrote to Clark and Milligan, to furnish goods to the said company, at their store in Pensacola, and that he would see them paid; that relying on the said engagement, they shipped further goods to the said company at Pensacola, and on the 31st of December, 1780, G. Galphin, the elder, owed,</p>
<p class="indent">sterling.</p>
<p class="indent">For himself,           Â£ 1,120  1 2</p>
<p class="indent">For Galphin, Holmes &amp; Co.   1,296  5 3</p>
<p class="indent">And, Jan. 1, 1784, for the Pensacola firm,   3,959 15 9</p>
<p>all of which is now due and unpaid.</p>
<p class="indent">That G. Galphin, the elder, died testate in 1781, or 1782, and duly appointed James Parsons, John Graham, Laughlin M'Gillvray, John Parkinson, William Dunbar, and his sons, John, George and Thomas Galphin, his executors; and left real and personal estate, sufficient to pay all his just debts.</p>
<p class="indent">That all the executors declined the trust, excepting the three sons; that the copartnership of Galphin, Holmes &amp; Co. was dissolved on the day of without any funds for the payment of their debts; that John and George Galphin, two of the executors, never meddled with the deceased's estate, having been long insolvent, are not within reach of the process of this court, are unknown to the complainant, and gone to places out of his knowledge.</p>
<p class="indent">That William Dunbar is dead, leaving no assets of the deceased's estate.</p>
<p class="indent">That David Holmes is dead, and left no property, to the knowledge of the complainant.</p>
<p class="indent">That Thomas Galphin and John Parkinson are out of the jurisdiction of the court, and not possessed of any property, to the knowledge of the complainant.</p>
<p class="indent">That John Milledge, and Martha his wife, who is daughter of G. Galphin, the elder, and a principal legatee and devisee under his will, have received, and are possessed of, lands, negroes, and assets of the estate of her father, which came to them by descent, devise, or distribution, and liable to the claim of the complainant.</p>
<p class="indent">That Thomas, who resides in South-Carolina, holds no property of the deceased in South-Carolina; that the assets in that state have all been exhausted in satisfying prior judgments, or otherwise.</p>
<p class="indent">That all the assets are in Georgia, in the hands of Milledge and wife, who must be considered as the agents and trustees of the executor, Thomas Galphin, or of the creditors, and liable to account for the same.</p>
<p class="indent">Milledge and wife, the only persons made defendants in the bill, pleaded in bar, as follows:</p>
<p class="indent">'The plea of Martha Milledge, one of the defendants to the bill of complaint of William Milligan.</p>
<p class="indent">'The end of the complainant's bill is to render liable to the payment and satisfaction of an unliquidated demand on an open account, said to be due by the estate of George Galphin, in his own right, and as security and guarantee for Galphin, Holmes and company, certain property, real and personal, which is charged by the complainant to have come into the hands and possession of this defendant, as one of the devisees and legatees of the said George Galphin, deceased.</p>
<p class="indent">'This defendant, by protestation not confessing all or any of the matters contained in the said bill to be true, in such manner and form as the same is therein set forth and alleged, doth plead in bar of the same, and for plea saith, that the complainant states that David Holmes, late copartner in the house of Galphin, Holmes &amp; Co. and David Holmes and Co. is dead, and left no property or legal representatives, at his decease, within the state of Georgia; that neither John Parkinson, nor William Dunbar, have ever qualified on the will of George Galphin, and have never come into the possession of any of the estate of the said George Galphin, or if they have, that it is disposed of and exhausted; that Thomas Galphin holds no property or estate of the said George Galphin, and that the assets of the said estate in the state of South-Carolina, have all been exhausted in satisfying prior judgments, or otherwise.</p>
<p class="indent">'But this defendant avers, that the said David Holmes died possessed of considerable estate, real and personal, part of which, if not all, must be in possession of his legal representatives; that William Dunbar <i>qualified</i> on the will of the said George Galphin, and died, leaving in the possession of his executors, administrators or legal representatives, considerable estate, real and personal, which he got, either by being one of the <i>qualified</i> and acting executors on the said will, or by his intermarriage with Judith Galphin, one of the devisees and legatees under the will of the said George.</p>
<p class="indent">'And this defendant further avers, that Thomas Galphin and John Parkinson, charged and stated to be two of the surviving copartners of which this defendant Co. and David Holmes &amp; Co. of which this defendant knoweth not, and said Thomas Galphin, being now the only acting and qualified executor of the last will and testament of the said George Galphin, are, and this defendant is ready to show, that they <i>must be</i> in possession of considerable real and personal estate, derived from the estate of the said George Galphin, deceased; that they are the proper persons liable and interested to contest, and who can with safety contest, the complainant's demands, if any he has, and the relief prayed in the said bill.</p>
<p class="indent">'And this defendant doth further aver, that the debt or demand of the complainant, if any doth exist, originated in the state of South-Carolina; that all material, necessary, and indispensable and requisite parties, to wit, the said Thomas Galphin and John Parkinson, and the executors, administrators or legal representatives of William Dunbar, live, and notoriously and openly reside, in the state of South-Carolina, and in possession of estates, real and personal, sufficient to pay the complainant's demand, if any he has, and which estates and property are more particularly liable to the said demand, if any he has; and that the said parties are also amenable and compellable to appear to any suit or bill brought against them by the said complainant, for his said demand, if any he has, in the state aforesaid. All of which facts are in the knowledge of the complainant, and to him well known, before the filing of his said bill, for that the complainant also lives and resides in the state of South-Carolina; that this defendant is an entire stranger to, and ignorant of the merits and justice of the claim set up by the complainant, not being named as executrix in the will of the said George Galphin, or ever having intermeddled with the <i>concerns</i> of the said estate, or any ways interested in the copartnership aforesaid. All which matters this defendant doth aver and plead, in bar of the complainant's said bill, and of his pretended demands, for which he seeks to be relieved by his said bill. And this defendant prays to be hence dismissed, with her reasonable costs, in this behalf most wrongfully sustained.'</p>
<p class="indent">This plea was sworn to, before a justice of peace.</p>
<p class="indent">The plea of John Milledge was the same, in substance, as that of his wife.</p>
<p class="indent">There was also a joint and several answer of Milledge and wife, which states no other facts than the following: viz. 'That there never did exist any secret or special trust, promise, covenant, or understanding, between these defendants and the executors of George Galphin, the elder, deceased, as charged in the bill of complaint, or did these defendants, or either of them, ever give any bond of indemnity, or other security whatever, to be accountable to Thomas Galphin, or John Parkinson, or any or either of the executors of the said George, for any property, real or personal, which <i>might have come</i> into the possession, or held by either of these defendants. That there does not now exist any secret or special trust, promise, covenant or understanding between these defendants and the executors aforesaid. And these defendants do, jointly and severally, deny all manner of unlawful combination,' &amp;c. 'without that, that any other matter or thing in the said bill of complaint contained, material or necessary for these defendants to answer unto, not herein answered unto. All which matters and things these defendants are ready to aver and maintain,' &amp;c.</p>
<p class="indent">At May term, 1803, of the circuit court, holden by his honor, Judge Moore, the only entries on the transcript of the record which came up, are, as follows: 'Bill and amended bill.' 'Plea and answers.' 'On argument the plea sustained.' There is no entry of a <i>demurrer</i>, or motion, or of any other proceeding, except the continuances, after filing the pleas and answers, until the May term, 1803.</p>
<p class="indent">At May term, 1804, of the circuit court, holden by his honor, Judge Johnson, the following decree was made.</p>
<p class="indent">'This cause came on to be heard this 14th day of May, in the year of our Lord, 1804, upon the bill and exhibits, and the pleas and answers of the defendants; whereupon, it appearing that in the term of May, 1803, before the honourable Alfred Moore, one of the judges of the said court, the cause was heard upon the bill and the pleas, and that after argument, it was adjudged by the court, at the term of May, 1803, that the said plea be sustained; and it appears that the complainant hath not replied to the said plea. It is therefore ordered and decreed, that the bill of complaint be dismissed, in pursuance and conformity to the decision of the court at the said term, upon the said plea, the same appearing to the court, to be conclusive on the merits of the complainant's bill.</p>
<p class="indent">Dated as Savannah, the day and year before written.</p>
<p class="indent">WILLIAM JOHNSON, Jun.</p>
<p class="indent">The complainant sued out his writ of error, and assigned for error,</p>
<p class="indent">1st. That by the said decree it is adjudged and decreed, that the plea in bar aforesaid, and the matters therein contained, are sufficient to debar the complainant from the discovery and relief sought after by his said bill of complaint, and are conclusive on the merits thereof, and that, therefore, the said plea should be sustained as a valid and sufficient answer to the bill of the complainant. Whereas, the said plea is altogether irrelevant and insufficient, and contains no matter, which, in law or equity, ought to bar the discovery and relief sought after by the bill aforesaid.</p>
<p class="indent">2d. That by the said decree, it is adjudged that the bill be dismissed, whereas, by the law of the land, and the rules of equity, a decree ought to have been made in favour of the complainant, for want of a sufficient answer upon the merits of the said bill, as to the relief prayed thereby.</p>
<p class="indent"><i>Key</i>, for plaintiff in error, contended, that the pleas in bar were insufficient and informal, and contained matter not proper for a plea.</p>
<p class="indent">The defence proper for a plea, must be such as reduces the cause to a particular point, and from thence creates a bar to the suit; and is to save the parties expense in examination. It is not every good <i>defence</i> in equity, that is likewise good as a plea; for where the defence consists of a variety of circumstances, there is no use of a plea; the examination must still be at large; and the effect of allowing such a plea, will be, that the court will give their judgment on the circumstances of the case, before they are made out by proof. 1 <i>Atk.</i> 54. <i>Chapman</i> v. <i>Turner</i>.</p>
<p class="indent">A plea cannot be a mere denial of facts charged in the bill; for such matter is only proper for an answer. But such a plea may be permitted to stand for an answer, with leave to except to its insufficiency. 1 <i>Brown, Ch. Ca.</i> 408, 409, 410.</p>
<p class="indent">The plea in this case sets forth five several distinct and independent matters, each of which is a denial of some allegation in the bill, and is, therefore, not proper for a plea, but for an answer. Nor do they go to make up one defence.</p>
<p class="indent">The most that can be said of the plea is, that it shows that there are other persons who ought to be made parties in the cause. Considered in this view, it may be supposed, perhaps, requiring that Thomas Galphin, J. Parkinson, the representatives of David Holmes, and those of W. Dunbar, should have been made parties.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p1">
<span class="num">1</span>
<p class="indent">There can be no ground of requiring the represenatives of Holmes to be made parties, because we seek relief only against the estate of G. Galphin, the elder, and not against that of Holmes. As to the representatives of Dunbar, even if it be true that he qualified as executor, yet we are not bound to proceed against them, as there is an executor surviving. We ask no relief against Parkinson, and, therefore, we need not make him a party. And as to Thomas Galphin, he is expressly alleged in the bill, and admitted in the plea, to be out of the jurisdiction of the court, and therefore, we were not bound to make him a party. This is expressly laid down by <i>Mitford, in his treatise of pleading, p.</i> 93, who says, 'if a want of proper parties is not apparent on the bill, a defendant may plead it; and a plea of this nature goes both to the discovery and the relief. <i>But where a sufficient reason is suggested by the bill, for not making the necessary party;</i> as where a personal representative is a necessary party, and the bill states that the representation is in contest, in the ecclesiastical court; <i>or where a necessary party is resident abroad, out of the jurisdiction of the court, and the bill charges that fact;</i> or where the bill seeks a discovery of the necessary parties, <i>a plea for want of parties will not be allowed</i>. A plea for want of parties to a bill, for a discovery merely, will not hold; for the plaintiff in that case seeks no decree.' <i>Prec. in Ch.</i> 83. <i>Cowslad</i> v. <i>Cely.</i> 2 <i>Atk.</i> Â§ 10. <i>Darwent</i> v. <i>Walton</i>.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p2">
<span class="num">2</span>
<p class="indent">As far as our bill seeks for relief, we could recover at law, against the defendants, as executors in their own wrong. It is true, that in equity, an executor <i>de son tort</i> is not known, but whenever a person would, at law, be executor <i>de son tort</i>, he will, in equity, be considered as a trustee for the creditors.</p>

<p class="indent">MARSHALL, Ch. J. The only question is, whether it is not necessary that you should bring a suit against the executor in South Carolina, to establish the <i>debt;</i> because, as to that, he is the proper person to defend. After having obtained such a judgment, the complainant would be at liberty to follow the estate in the hands of the defendants, in Georgia. It is not necessary to consider them as executors in their own wrong; for you may proceed against devisees or legatees, if the executor has no assets.</p>

<div class="prelims">
<p class="indent">ERROR to the circuit court of the district of Columbia, sitting at Alexandria.</p>
<p class="indent">The declaration was in debt on a bond dated the 3<i>d of October</i>, 1799, in the penalty of 5,000 dollars. On <i>oyer</i>, the bond appeared to be dated the 3d of <i>January</i>, 1799, and the condition was as follows: 'Whereas, the said Stephen Cooke did lend to Josiah Watson, of the town of Alexandria, twenty-five hundred dollars of the said William Graham's money; and the said Josiah Watson having failed, but before he failed paid five hundred dollars; and whereas, the said Stephen Cooke hath instituted a suit against the said Josiah Watson, for the recovery of the said moneyâ€”Now the condition of the above obligation is such, that if the said Stephen Cooke shall well and truly pay the whole sum so lent, if it can be recovered from the said Josiah Watson, or his indorsor; or in case it cannot be wholly recovered, will lose the one half of that sum which cannot be recovered, then the above obligation shall be void, otherwise to remain in full force and virtue.'</p>
<p class="indent">After <i>oyer</i> granted, the defendant had leave to imparle, but not pleading at the rule day, judgment was rendered at the rules for want of a plea.</p>
<p class="indent">At the next term, the defendant set aside the office-judgment, by demurring generally to the declaration, which demurrer was joined by the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="indent">Afterwards, on motion, the defendant had leave to withdraw his demurrer, and pleaded general performance of the condition of the bond. To which the plaintiff replied, and assigned a breach in this, that the defendant has not paid the sum of money mentioned in the condition, or any part thereof. The defendant rejoined, that the sum of money in the condition mentioned, lent by him to Watson, could not be recovered from the latter, or his indorsor.</p>
<p class="indent">To this rejoinder the plaintiff demurred specially; 1st. Because the defendant doth not state, in his rejoinder, that he used all legal means for the recovery of the said 2,500 dollars of Watson, and his indorsor.</p>
<p class="indent">2d. Because the defendant does not state that he has not recovered any part of the said 2,500 dollars of the said Watson, or his indorsor, or how much of the 2,500 dollars remains unrecovered of the said Watson, or his indorsor.</p>
<p class="indent">3d. Because the defendant is bound to pay one half of the sum that is not recovered of the said Watson, or his indorsor; and if the defendant has not received any part of the 2,500 dollars of the said Watson, or his indorsor, then he is bound, by the condition of the said bond, to pay one half of the sum of 2,500 dollars to the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="indent">4th. Because the defendant does not give any answer as to the sum of 500 dollars, stated in the condition of the said bond to have been received by him of the said Watson, before the execution of the said bond.</p>
<p class="indent">5th. Because the rejoinder is a departure from the plea of conditions performed.</p>
<p class="indent">Upon this demurrer, the judgment of the court being in favour of the plaintiff, the defendant, upon motion, had leave to file an additional plea, whereupon he pleaded, that the whole sum lent to Watson could not be recovered of him or his indorsor, nor could any part thereof be recovered, except the sum of 500 dollars, mentioned in the condition of the bond; by means whereof the defendant became liable and bound to pay to the plaintiff only one half of the said sum which could not be so recovered, and that the defendant paid to the plaintiff's intestate the said one half of the said sum of money which he was liable and bound to pay as aforesaid. To which plea there was a general replication and issue, and verdict for the plaintiff for 2,032 dollars and 75 cents.</p>
<p class="indent">On the trial of this issue a bill of exceptions was taken by the defendant below to the opinion of the court, that the plaintiff was entitled, by the said bond, to recover of the defendant the sum of 500 dollars at all events; and that he was also thereby entitled to recover of the defendant the residue of the said 2,500 dollars, if the jury should be of opinion that the defendant could have recovered the same of the said Watson, or his indorsor. And if they should be of opinion that no part of the said residue could have been so recovered, then the plaintiff is thereby entitled to recover of the defendant one half of the said residue, in addition to the said sum of 500 dollars.</p>
<p class="indent">Other exceptions were taken at the trial, but were abandoned by the plaintiff in error in this court.</p>
<p class="indent"><i>Simms</i>, for plaintiff in error, contended,</p>
<p class="indent">1st. That the judgment of the court below, upon the demurrer, ought to have been for the defendant, inasmuch as there was a material variance between the bond produced on <i>oyer</i>, and that stated in the declaration; the former bearing date on the 3d day of January, 1799, and the latter being alleged to bear date on the 3d day of October, in the same year.</p>
<p class="indent">2d. That the court erred in their construction of the condition of the bond, in supposing that the sum of 500 dollars, mentioned to have been received from Watson, was covered by the penalty, and in instructing the jury that the plaintiff was entitled to recover that sum at all events; and, in addition thereto, a moiety of the balance, if the whole balance could not be recovered by the defendant of Watson, or his indorsor.</p>
<p class="indent">1st. On a demurrer, the court must go to the first error in the pleadings. In this case, although the rejoinder is bad, yet the declaration is bad also. If the plaintiff declares on a bond of different date from that produced on <i>oyer</i>, advantage may be taken of the variance on demurrer. The plaintiff need not wait till it is produced in evidence. The variance may also be pleaded in abatement. 2 <i>Salk.</i> 658, <i>Holman</i> v. <i>Borough</i>. In the case of <i>Hole</i> v. <i>Finch</i>, 2 <i>Wils.</i> 394, the court said, 'that formerly, when the <i>whole original writ</i> was spread in the same roll with the <i>court</i> thereupon, if a variance appeared between the <i>writ</i> and <i>count</i>, the defendant might have taken advantage thereof, either by <i>motion</i> in arrest of judgment, writ of <i>error</i>, plea in <i>abatement</i>, or <i>demurrer</i>. But afterwards it was determined, that if the defendant will take advantage of a <i>variance</i> between the <i>writ</i> and <i>count</i>, he must demand <i>oyer</i> of the writ, and show it to the court. By the act of <i>jeofails</i> of Virginia, <i>Revised Code, p.</i> 118, Â§ 26, no judgment after verdict shall be staid for the omission of the day, month or year, in the declaration or pleading, (the name, sum, quantity or time, being right in any part of the record or proceeding.) This shows, that before that act, such omission might have been taken advantage of by motion in arrest of judgment.</p>
<p class="indent">WASHINGTON, J. Will the principle of going up to the first error, apply to a special demurrer by the adverse party?</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p1">

<div class="num" id="p4">

<p class="indent">2d. As to the construction of the bond.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p5">
<span class="num">5</span>
<p class="indent">By the opinion of the court, the plaintiff was entitled, by the bond, to recover the 500 dollars at all events.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p6">
<span class="num">6</span>
<p class="indent">The 500 dollars are only mentioned in the premable of the condition, which, like that of a statute, has no obligatory effect. It is no part of the condition of the bond, that the defendants should pay that sum. It might have been paid over before, or the intestate may have been satisfied with relying on the defendant's simple acknowledgment that he had received it. The condition is in the alternative, and only one of two things is to be done. 1st. Either to pay over the whole 2,500 dollars, if he could recover it from Watson, or his indorsorâ€”or, 2d. If he could not recover the whole sum, to pay over one half of such sum as he could not recover. There is no obligation, under the bond, to pay over what he had already received. Perhaps the plaintiff may bring an action for money had and received for the 500 dollars. But it is not material how he is to recover it. It is sufficient, in the present case, that its payment is no part of the condition of this bond.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p7">
<span class="num">7</span>
<p class="indent">The sum which could not be recovered is capable of being ascertained; and it is now ascertained to be 2,000 dollars. One half of that is the sum which the defendant agreed to lose. It is, therefore, the same as if the condition of the bond had been to pay the sum of 1,000 dollars.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p8">
<span class="num">8</span>
<p class="indent">But if no part of the money lent could be recovered of Watson, or his indorsor, then the defendant could not be bound to pay more than the one half of the whole sum, which is only 1,250 dollars. In no case is he bound <i>by the bond</i> to pay more than that sum; and yet the jury have given the plaintiff 1,500 dollars, with interest thereon, from the date of the bond.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p9">
<span class="num">9</span>
<p class="indent"><i>E. J. Lee</i>, contra, admitted the general rule, that upon a demurrer, the court is to look for the first error, and give judgment accordingly; but that, in this case, the state of the pleadings makes a difference. The declaration was filed in due time, and a <i>profert</i> made. A judgment was obtained against the defendant, in the office, for want of a plea. This judgment was set aside by the defendant's appearance and entering a general demurrer, which was afterwards withdrawn, and a general performance of the condition of the bond pleaded. By this plea, after <i>oyer</i>, he had admitted, that the bond declared on is the same as that produced on <i>oyer</i>. And having thus admitted it to be the same bond, the omission of its true date, in one part of the declaration, can only be matter of form. He has not pleaded it in abatement, nor demurred specially. On the plaintiff's special demurrer the defendant cannot take advantage of a <i>formal</i> variance; he can only avail himself of it by demurring specially himself. Every thing is form, without which, a right of action appears to the court. Every thing which the court may amend, without altering matter of substance, is aided by a general demurrer. <i>Sav.</i> 88. So, every thing which may be amended under the statute, or which would be cured by a verdict, is cured by a general demurrer.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p10">
<span class="num">10</span>
<p class="indent">2d. As to the second point, there can be no doubt. The condition of the bond is, that the defendant shall pay the <i>whole sum so lent</i>, viz. 2,500 dollars, if it could be recovered by the defendant from Watson. But at the time the bond was executed, the defendant could recover only 2,000 dollars of Watson, in any event, because Watson had already paid 500 dollars. In this case, the 500 dollars is covered by the penalty.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p11">
<span class="num">11</span>
<p class="indent">But it is said, that these 500 dollars were not to be paid over unless the defendant recovered the <i>whole</i> sum from Watson; or in other words, that the 500 dollars were a premium to the defendant for losing 2,000 dollars of the plaintiff's money. But the <i>whole</i> was to be paid over when recovered; the whole includes all its parts; hence every part was to be paid over when recovered.</p>

<p class="indent">No man can be compelled, by his bond, to pay more than he expressly agreed to pay. The defendant has only bound himself to pay the whole, in case the <i>whole</i> could be recovered. It does not appear that the 500 dollars were not paid or settled in some other way.</p>

</div>
<div class="num" id="p19">
<span class="num">19</span>
<p class="indent">The plaintiff declares upon a bond, dated the 3d of October; and upon <i>oyer</i>, the bond appears to bear date the 3d of January preceding.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p20">
<span class="num">20</span>
<p class="indent">By the <i>oyer</i>, the bond is made a part of the declaration. There were several pleadings, and among the rest, a bad declaration, a bad rejoinder, and a special demurrer by the plaintiff to this bad rejoinder. When the whole pleadings are thus spread upon the record by a demurrer, it is the duty of the court to examine the whole, and go to the first error. When the special demurrer is by the plaintiff, his own pleadings are to be scrutinized, and the court will notice what would have been had upon a general demurrer. The variance between the date of the bond declared upon, and that produced on <i>oyer</i>, is fatal.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p21">
<span class="num">21</span>
<p class="indent">Upon the second point the court is of opinion, that there is no error in the construction given by the court below to the condition of the bond.

<div class="num" id="p1">
<span class="num">1</span>
<p class="indent">THIS was a writ of error to the circuit court of the United States, for the district of <i>Georgia</i>, sitting in chancery, to reverse a decree which dismissed the complainant's bill on a demurrer.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p2">
<span class="num">2</span>
<p class="indent">The complainant, as assignee of <i>Cruden and Company</i>, alleged, in his bill, that on the 24th of December, 1782, during the war between, the United States and Great-Britain, the British armed ship <i>Dawes</i>, owned by <i>Crudem and Company</i>, who were British subjects, and commanded by <i>Oswell Eve</i>, the defendant, sailed with a cargo, the property of <i>Cruden and Company</i>, from Kingston, in Jamaica, for New-York, then in possession of the British troops. That on her passage the ship met with much tempestuous weather, by which she was rendered incapable of reaching her port of destination; in consequence of which, the defendant, after consultation with the crew and passengers, came to the determination to sail for the nearest port in the United States, thereby to save the lives of the crew and passengers, which were in imminent danger, and also to save as much as possible to the owners. That the vessel and cargo were liable to be captured by the cruisers of the United States; or if she went into any port of the United States, without being captured, she would become a <i>droit</i> of admiralty to the United States, or some of them. That the defendant stated to the crew and passengers, that as congress, by their resolve of the 9th of December, 1781, had enacted and declared, 'That all ships and vessels, with their cargoes, which should be seized by the respective crews thereof, should be deemed and adjudged as lawful prize to the captors,' as the vessel was incapable of reaching New-York, and as she would be totally lost to the owners, to himself, and the crew, if captured by the cruisers of the United States, the best mode would be, to seize and capture the vessel and cargo, make the passengers, who were military men of high rank and distinction, prisoners of war, and sail for the nearest port, and there obtain a condemnation of the vessel and cargo, for the benefit and compensation of the crew, who would lose their wages, if she was regularly captured, and that the residue should remain in the defendant's hands, as agent and trustee, and for the sole use and benefit of the owners. That this plan was agreed to, and executed; and an agreement, signed by the defendant and the crew, ascertaining what share each man was to be allowed, and which was to be the basis of the judge's decree, as to the distribution of the prize-money. That the crew consented to the defendant's having a larger share than they would, if he had not declared his intention to act in the whole, as the agent and trustee, and for the benefit of the owners. That the vessel was accordingly carried into a port in North-Carolina, libelled, condemned, and distribution made, according to the proportion fixed by the agreement. That the defendant afterwards purchased a number of the shares of the seamen, for the benefit of his owners; that he also purchased part of the cargo, at the marshal's sales, and shipped it to Charleston, where he sold it to great profit, for the benefit of the owners. The bill then prays a discovery, and that the defendant may account, and be decreed to pay, &amp;c.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p3">
<span class="num">3</span>
<p class="indent">To this bill the defendant demurred, and assigned two causes of demurrer.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p4">
<span class="num">4</span>
<p class="indent">1. That it appears by the complainant's own showing, that the ship and cargo were regularly condemned under the resolve of congress, of the 9th of December, 1781, as lawful prize, and the proceeds decreed to the defendant, and others, as lawful captors, the legality of which decree ought not now to be called in question.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p5">
<span class="num">5</span>
<p class="indent">2. That the bill contains no matter of equity, but what is cognizable at law.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p6">
<span class="num">6</span>
<p class="indent">Upon argument, the judge (Stephens) sustained the demurrer, and dismissed the bill, but without costs.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p7">
<span class="num">7</span>
<p class="indent"><i>P. B. Key</i>, for the plaintiff in error. The principal question is, whether the complainant has equity.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p8">
<span class="num">8</span>
<p class="indent">If Eve had given up the ship for his own benefit, it would have been an act of barratry, a breach of trust, and the owners would have had a right of action at law against him, for his misfeasance. But they may, if they please, affirm his surrender of the vessel, and oblige the defendant to account.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p9">
<span class="num">9</span>
<p class="indent">If there is any impediment to the relief sought, it must be grounded on the resolve of congress; for if the owners had a right of action at law, it was saved by the treaty of peace.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p10">
<span class="num">10</span>
<p class="indent">The master was always under a moral obligation to account, whatever protection he might derive from the resolve of congress, which gave the whole ship and cargo as prize. There being then a moral obligation, sufficient to support a promise, so as to prevent it from being <i>nudum pactum</i>, and an express promise charged in the bill, and confessed by the demurrer, there is nothing wanting to entitle the complainant to the relief he asks. It is true, that the promise was made to the crew, yet it enures to the benefit of the owners. Should it be said that the promise was <i>in fraudem legis</i>, the answer is, that it was a <i>stratagem of war</i>, and, therefore, justifiable. In <i>foro conscientioe</i>, it was as justifiable to evade as to enforce such a law; and if it was a fraud against the law of congress to receive the proceeds of the ship and cargo, for the use of the owners, it was equally a fraud against the owners, to persuade the crew to carry the vessel into a port of the United States, under a pretence of saving the property to the owners, and afterwards to take the whole proceeds to his own use.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p11">
<span class="num">11</span>
<p class="indent"><i>Harper</i>, contra. The ordinance of congress of 4th December, 1781, (<i>7 vol. journals of congress, p.</i> 243) it is true, authorised mutiny and treachery, but it was only a law of retaliation. The British had adopted a similar provision; and congress found it necessary to retaliate.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p12">
<span class="num">12</span>
<p class="indent">The facts stated by the complainant, in his bill, are such as show the necessity of delivering up the vessel, and that she was absolutely lost to the owners.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p13">
<span class="num">13</span>
<p class="indent">The bill states expressly, that she was incapable of reaching her port of destination; that she must either founder or be captured, or voluntarily run into an enemy's port. It justifies the conduct of the master, in giving up the vessel, but grounds its claim to relief, either upon a supposed moral obligation of the defendant, (resulting from his duty, as master of the vessel) to do every thing in his power for the benefit of the owners; or upon an express promise made to the crew, which, it is contended, enures to the benefit of the owners; or upon an allegation of an imposition upon the crew, to induce them to consent to deliver up the vessel.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p14">
<span class="num">14</span>
<p class="indent">As to the first ground, the master's duty did not oblige him to violate the laws of another country, especially of that country to whose laws he applied for protection and relief. His duty to his owners ceased, when he could no longer preserve the property by fair and honourable means. His duty could never oblige him to commit a fraud upon the good faith even of an enemy.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p15">
<span class="num">15</span>
<p class="indent">The second ground is that of an express promise to the crew. This is liable to three objections. 1st. That it is a promise without consideration, and, therefore, <i>nudum pactum</i>. 2d. That it is not made to the ownersâ€”and, 3d. That it was <i>in fraudem legis</i>.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p16">
<span class="num">16</span>
<p class="indent">The third ground of claim is that of imposition upon the crew, to induce them to give up the vessel. This, if it can be the ground of claim by any person, must be that of a claim by the crew, or some of them, to set aside the agreement for the division of the prize-monty, and cannot be a ground of claim by the complainant. It is also liable to the objection, that the courts of the United States can never sanction a claim, grounded upon a fraud upon the laws of the United States.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p17">
<span class="num">17</span>
<p class="indent">The owners, by affirming the transaction, and calling upon the defendant to account, have made themselves a party to the fraud; and the maxim of law applies, <i>in pari delictu melior est conditio possidentis</i>.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p18">
<span class="num">18</span>
<p class="indent">To show the extent of the principle, that contracts <i>in fraudem legis</i> were void, he referred the court to the following authorities. <i>Plowden's Commentaries</i>, 75. 1 <i>Domat</i>, 145. 2 <i>Bac. Ab.</i> 582. <i>Cowper</i>, 39, 342. 1 <i>T. R.</i> 734. 1 <i>Atk.</i> 352. 2 <i>Atk.</i> 136. <i>Buller</i>, 146. 2 <i>P. Williams</i>, 134, 347, 350. 3 <i>T. R.</i> 454.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p19">
<span class="num">19</span>
<p class="indent"><i>Key</i>, in reply. The foundation of this bill is the original trust, before the agreement with the crew. It was a violation of that trust to give up the ship. The defendant was bound to do all in his power to protect the property. If he has been guilty of a fraud upon the United States, the owners were not a party. The fraud of which the plaintiff complains is, that the defendant induced the crew to give up the ship, under the idea of doing it for the benefit of the owners, and then turning round, and pleading the resolve of congress against the claim of the owners.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p20">
<span class="num">20</span>
<p class="indent">But if that resolve was a bar, a subsequent acknowledgment of the original trust, and a promise to account, will again set it up.</p>

<div class="num" id="p21">
<span class="num">21</span>
<p class="indent">MARSHALL, Ch. J. delivered the opinion of the court.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p22">
<span class="num">22</span>
<p class="indent">The essential difficulty in this cause, arises from the consideration, that under the resolution of congress, by which the vessel and cargo mentioned in the proceedings were condemned, a sanction is claimed to a breach of trust, and a violation of moral principle. In such a case, the mind submits reluctantly to the rule of law, and laboriously searches for something which shall reconcile that rule with what would seem to be the dictate of abstract justice.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p23">
<span class="num">23</span>
<p class="indent">It has been correctly argued by the plaintiff in error, that the captain was under obligations to the owners, from which, in a moral point of view, he could not be completely absolved. He was bound to save for them the ship and cargo by all fair means within his power; but he was no bound to employ fraud in order to effect the object. The situation of the vessel unquestionably justified her being carried into the the port of an enemy, and, perhaps, in the courts of England, the libelling of the vessel, by the captain and crew, might be construed to be an act which would enure solely to the benefit of the owners; but war certainly gives the right to annoy an enemy by means such as those which were employed by congress, and courts are bound to consider them as legitimate, and to leave to them their full operation.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p24">
<span class="num">24</span>
<p class="indent">The agreement to save the ship and cargo, under the semblance of a condemnation, was not, in itself, an immoral act; it was, as has been truly said, a <i>stratagem</i> which the laws of war would authorise, but it was certainly a fraud upon the resolution of congress, and no principle can be more clear, than that the courts of the United States can furnish no aid in giving efficacy to it. Congress having a perfect right, in a state of open war, to tempt the navigators of enemy-vessels to bring them into the American ports, by making the vessel and cargo prize to the captors, the condemnation of a vessel so brought in amounted necessarily to an absolute transfer of the property, and to a complete annihilation, in a legal point of view, of the title of the owners, and of their claim upon the captain. Had no communication taken place between the captain and his crew, whereby a portion of the prize-money was allotted to him in trust for the owners, which would not have been allotted to him as a captor, in virtue of his station in the vessel, it would have been a plain case of prize under the resolution of congress, and any intention under which the capture was made, whether declared or not, would have been, like other acts of the will, controulable and alterable by the persons who had entertained it. But if, by a contract with the crew, stipulating certain advantages for the owners of the ship and cargo, the vessel has been carried in when she would not otherwise have been carried in, or a larger proportion of the prize has been allowed to the captain than would have been allowed to him for his own use, a plain fraud has been committed by him, and the question, whether the trust which he assumed upon himself, and under which he obtained possession of the property, can be enforced in this court, is one of more difficulty, upon which a difference of opinion has prevailed. It has been thought by some of the judges, that the contract being in itself compatible with the strictest rules of morality, and being opposed by only a temporary and war regulation, which exists no longer, may now be enforced. But upon more mature consideration, the majority of the judges accede to the opinion, that the contract being clearly in fraud of the law, as existing at the time, a law to which, under the circumstances attending it, no just exceptions can be taken, its execution cannot be compelled by the courts of that country, to evade whose laws it was made. The person in possession must be left in possession of that which the decree of a competent tribunal has given him.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p25">
<span class="num">25</span>
<p class="indent">This opinion seems completely to decide the point made under the treaty of peace. According to it, a debt never existed to which the treaty could apply. No debt was due from the captain to his owners, but in virtue of the confiscation of the ship and cargo, and it has never been alleged, that the treaty extended to captures made during the war, of property in the actual possession of the enemy, whatever might be the means employed in making them.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p26">
<span class="num">26</span>
<p class="indent">If the allegations of the bill had stated any contract subsequent to the condemnation, by which captain Eve had made himself a trustee, the previous moral obligation might have furnished a sufficient consideration for that contract. But the allegations of the bill are not sufficiently explicit on this point. They do not make out such a case. His declarations appear to have been contemporaneous with the transaction, and only to have manifested the intention under which he acted, an intention which he was at liberty to change.</p>

<p>The question of jurisdiction was submitted to the court without argument, by P.B. Key, for the appellants, and Harper, for the appellees.</p>
<p>On a subsequent day,</p>
<p>MARSHALL, Ch. J. delivered the opinion of the court.</p>
<p>The court has considered this case, and is of opinion that the jurisdiction cannot be supported.</p>
<p>The words of the act of congress are, "where an alien is a party; or the suit is between a citizen of a state where the suit is brought, and a citizen of another state."</p>
<p>The court understands these expressions to meant that each distinct interest should be represented by persons, all of whom are entitled to sue, or may be sued, in the federal courts. That is, that where the interest is joint, each of the persons concerned in that interest must be competent to sue, or liable to be sued, in those courts.</p>
<p>But the court does not mean to give an opinion in the case where several parties represent several distinct interests, <span class="star-pagination">*268</span> and some of those parties are, and others are not, competent to sue, or liable to be sued, in the courts of the United States.</p>
<p>Decree affirmed.</p>

<p><span class="star-pagination">*269</span> E.J. Lee, for plaintiffs in error.</p>
<p>February 13.</p>
<p>MARSHALL, Ch. J. after stating the case, delivered the opinion of the court.</p>
<p>This court has no jurisdiction, under the 25th section of the judiciary act of 1789, but in a case where a final judgment or decree has been rendered in the highest court of law or equity of a state, in which a decision in the suit could be had, where is drawn in question, the validity of a treaty or statute of, or an authority exercised under the United States, and the decision is against their validity, &amp;c. or where is drawn in question, the construction of any clause of the constitution, or of a treaty, or statute of, or commission <span class="star-pagination">*270</span> held under the United States, and the decision is against the title, right, privilege or exemption, specially set up or claimed by either party, under such clause of the said constitution, treaty, statute or commission.</p>
<p>In the present case, such of the defendants as were aliens, filed a petition to remove the cause to the federal circuit court, under the 12th section of the same act. The state court granted the prayer of the petition, and ordered the cause to be removed; the decision, therefore, was not against the privilege claimed under the statute; and, therefore, this court has no jurisdiction in the case.</p>
<p>The writ of error must be dismissed.</p>

TAYLOR AND MASSIE.</h1></center>
<center><p><b>Supreme Court of United States.</b></p></center>
<center></center>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*275</span> Breckenridge, attorney-general, for plaintiff in error.</p>
<p>Hughes, for defendant in error.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*280</span> MARSHALL, Ch. J. delivered the opinion of the court.</p>
<p>The bill states the original contracts, and claims a specific performance, by permitting the plaintiff to elect the 500 acres to which he is entitled, out of the tract of 1,000 acres, which had been located on Paint Creek; and also contains a prayer for general relief.</p>
<p>On the specific object of the bill, the right to make an election out of the lands on Paint Creek, there can be no difficulty. One thousand acres, part of the original warrant, having been clearly withdrawn at the time of the contract, from the quantity out of which the 500 acres, sold by the defendant, were to be chosen, there can be no pretext for the claim set up in the bill.</p>
<p>As little foundation is there for the claim to damages, instead of the land itself, on account of the 500 acres stated in the answer to have been sold; which sale, the counsel for the complainant considers as a wrong which has put out of his client's reach a tract he had a right to elect, and has, consequently, disabled the defendant from complying with his contract.</p>
<p>To this claim, two answers may be given, either of which would completely defeat it.</p>
<p>1st. The fact found by the jury shows, that the defendant is still ready to convey this land. The attorney-general would exclude this finding from the case, because it contradicts the admission of the answer; and it is a rule of law, that a finding which contradicts a fact admitted in the pleadings, is to be disregarded.</p>
<p>The principle of law is unquestionably laid down correctly; but the court can perceive no incompatibility between the admission of the answer, and the fact, as found by the jury. They may both be true; and, of consequence, <span class="star-pagination">*281</span> the court must consider both as true. After the answer was filed, the land may have been repurchased by Mr. Taylor, and such a repurchase would have been proper evidence to justify the fact found by the jury, and would put him in a situation to perform his contract, so far as respected this particular tract. But were it even otherwise Â—</p>
<p>The 2d answer is, that the concession made by the defendant must be taken altogether. He states the complainant to have refused this particular tract of 500 acres before it was sold. The complainant had, consequently, elected not to take it, and, of course, the defendant was at liberty to dispose of it.</p>
<p>The other point in the case is attended with more difficulty. It is, that the representation made by Taylor, at the time of the sale, was untrue in a material point. He represented the tract of 1,000 acres which had been located, and out of which the plaintiff would have a right to take the lands he purchased, to lie on Hingston's fork of Licking, when, in truth, it lay on Slate, another branch of the same river, where the lands prove to be less valuable than on Hingston. That this misrepresentation is material, cannot be denied; but it is contended by the defendant, that it originated in mistake, not in fraud; and as the country was at that time unknown to both the contracting parties, and the material object was to give the purchaser a right to take the land he had purchased out of the tract already located for the seller, an accidental error in the description of the place where the tract in contemplation of the parties lay; an error which could have had, at the time, no influence on the contract, ought not now to affect the person who has innocently committed it.</p>
<p>From the situation of the parties and of the country, and from the form of the entry, it is reasonable to presume, that this apology is true in point of fact; but the court does not conceive that the fact will amount to a legal justification of the person who has made the misrepresentation. He who sells property on a description given by himself, is bound to make good that description; and if it be untrue in a material point, although the variance be occasioned by a mistake, he must still remain <span class="star-pagination">*282</span> liable for that variance. In this case, the defendant has sold land on Hingston, and offers land on Slate. He has sold that which he cannot convey, and as he cannot execute his contract, he must answer in damages.</p>
<p>It is, therefore, the opinion of the court, that the plaintiff is entitled to an issue, to ascertain the damages he has sustained by the inability of the defendant to perform his contract, and to the damages which shall be found.</p>
<p>Although, in the general principles laid down, the court was unanimous, I did not, in consequence of the particular circumstances of this case, concur in the opinion which has been delivered. I will briefly state those circumstances.</p>
<p>In his bill, the plaintiff does not allege, that he was, in any degree, induced to make the contract, by supposing the land already located to lie on Hington's fork. This representation, then, was an accidental circumstance which has not, in the slightest degree, influenced his conduct. Nor does he now, in his bill, urge this variance in the description of the property as a reason for claiming damages, instead of the specific thing contracted to be sold. Nor does it appear, that this claim was set up in the district court. On the contrary, he alleges, that the land on Paint Creek is also in his power, and insists on making his election out of that tract. Under such a bill, in a case where the contract is a very advantageous one to the purchaser, I am not convinced that a court of equity ought to award him damages, on account of an error in the description of the property which was innocent in itself, which at the time appeared to be unimportant, and which most obviously did not conduce to, or in any manner affect, the contract. The person claiming damages in such a case should, I think, be left to his remedy at law. I should, therefore, have been disposed to affirm the decree of the district court. I am, however, perfectly content with that which I have been directed to deliver.<sup>[*]</sup></p>

SPEED.</h1></center>
<center><p><b>Supreme Court of United States.</b></p></center>
<center></center>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*285</span> Hughes, for the plaintiff in error.</p>
<p>Breckenridge, Attorney-General, for defendant.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*290</span> MARSHALL, Ch. J. delivered the opinion of the court.</p>
<p>In this case, the errors assigned are,</p>
<p>1. That testimony has been improperly rejected by the judge of the district court.</p>
<p>2. That the caveat, as to that part of the land which was claimed in virtue of the survey on Wilson's settlement-right, was improperly dismissed.</p>
<p>The caveat, so far as respects the claim of Wilson, in virtue of the survey on his preemption-warrant, thus stated his title: "John Wilson claims, by virtue of the survey, made on the entry of his preemption-warrant, for Andrew Cowan, and assigned by him to William Dryden, for his use."</p>
<p>The preemption-warrant issued on Wilson's certificate to Andrew Cowan, as assignee thereof; the survey was made in Cowan's name, and is assigned to William Dryden, but the assignment does not purport to be for the use of John Wilson.</p>
<p>At the trial, the plaintiff offered to prove, that the assignment to Cowan was made in trust for himself, and that the assignment to Dryden was never made by Cowan. The witness, by whom these facts were to be substantiated, was Cowan himself. He was objected to by the counsel for the defendant, as incompetent, and the objection was sustained by the court. To this opinion of the district judge, an exception was taken, and the question proposed, is the competency of Cowan to prove the fact, that he never was entitled to the land in controversy, and did not make the assignment of the survey.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*291</span> We put the release out of the case, because it cannot affect the interest of Cowan, if he had any, that interest being a liability to the person appearing to be his assignee.</p>
<p>Upon a consideration of this fact, and its connection with a caveat brought by Wilson, the witness appears to the court, to stand free from any possible objection on the part of the defendant. It would not appear, that he could derive a benefit from proving in this cause, that he never was entitled to the land in dispute, and never assigned the survey.</p>
<p>But, from the facts proposed by the plaintiff, which were before the court, it appears that Dryden had sold to Buford, for whose benefit this caveat was really brought; and it is alleged by the counsel for the defendant, that if the testimony of the witness would establish the right of those who might ultimately resort to him, under his supposed assignment, and such a suit would be prevented by a decision of this caveat, in favour of Wilson, he is, therefore, an incompetent witness; but the court does not perceive, that this consequence would flow from the testimony; and if it is imagined, that Cowan might suspect it, this would constitute an objection, rather to his credit than his competency. Cowan, therefore, was competent to prove the facts, to establish which, his testimony was offered. But if he had been received, and had established those facts, what would have been their amount? They are,</p>
<p>"That Cowan never did purchase the said preemption, did not make the entry on the preemption-warrant, or survey it, or procure it to be surveyed, and does not now, nor ever did, claim title to the same.</p>
<p>"That the plaintiff, claiming to own the land, did sell it to William Dryden, who sold the same to William Buford, for whose benefit the caveat was brought."</p>
<p>These are the facts, which the plaintiff proposed to prove, and which are stated on the record. Had they <span class="star-pagination">*292</span> been proved, it appears to the court, that the caveat ought to have been dismissed. These facts do not support the title set up in the caveat.</p>
<p>It is conceived by this court, that the statements made in the caveat could only be supported by an assignment, which, on the face of it, purported to be for the use of Wilson. That an assignment made to Dryden, whereby the legal ownership of the survey was conveyed to him, although, in fact, intended for the benefit of Wilson, would not enable Wilson to maintain a caveat in his own name. It would authorise him to use the name of Cowan, but not to prosecute the suit in his own name. If, however, a contrary practice has been firmly established in Kentucky, the court would be very unwilling to shake that practice. But in this case, the assignment to Dryden was not, in fact, for the use of Wilson, but of Dryden himself. The testimony, therefore, if received, could only have defeated the plaintiff's action. It cannot be said, therefore, that the judge has erred in dismissing the caveat, as to the part claimed under the preemption-warrant.</p>
<p>But, with respect to so much of the caveat as was supported by the survey on the settlement-right, no exception of form, or to the testimony, has been taken, and it ought not, therefore, to have been dismissed, but on the merits. On this point, therefore, there is error in the judgment of the district court, for which it must be reversed.</p>
<p>This cause came on to be heard, on the transcript of the record of the proceedings of the court, for the district of Kentucky, and was argued by counsel, on consideration whereof, it seems to the court, that there is error in the judgment of the district court in this, that the caveat entered by the plaintiff was entirely dismissed, whereas, it ought to have been decided on its merits, so far as respected that part of the land which was claimed by the plaintiff under his survey of four hundred acres. It is, therefore, considered by the court, that the said judgment be reversed and annulled; <span class="star-pagination">*293</span> and that the defendant pay to the plaintiff, his costs. And the cause is remanded for further proceedings.</p>

<p><span class="star-pagination">*299</span> This question was submitted, without argument, by Swann, for the plaintiffs in error, and E.J. Lee, for the defendant.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*300</span> MARSHALL, Ch. J.</p>
<p>The error complained of is, that the circuit court did not give an opinion on a point proposed. The court was certainly bound to give an opinion, if required, upon any point relevant to the issue.</p>
<p>It appears, from the facts stated, that the cause of action did not accrue until the 19th of November, when the negotiation for a compromise was broken off. A tender of the flour at any time, after the 14th, and before the 19th, would have been a compliance with the contract.</p>
<p>As the plaintiff claimed no more than the price of the flour on the 19th, and as the refusal of the court to instruct the jury, did not alter the verdict, which was for the price on that day, and was for the same amount as if the opinion had been given, there is no error of which the defendants could complain.</p>
<p>Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>

<center><h1>SIMMS AND WISE<br/>
v.<br/>
SLACUM.</h1></center>
<center><p><b>Supreme Court of United States.</b></p></center>
<center></center>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*303</span> C. Lee, for plaintiffs in error.</p>
<p>Swann, for defendant in error.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*306</span> MARSHALL, Ch. J. delivered the opinion of the majority of the court.</p>
<p>This case depends on the construction of an act of the legislature of Virginia, which allows the prison-rules to a debtor whose body is in execution, on his giving bond, with sufficient security, not to go out of the rules or bounds of the prison; that is, while a prisoner. The condition usually inserted is, not to depart therefrom till he shall be discharged by due course of law, or shall pay the debt. The act further provides, that the prisoner, on delivering a schedule of his property on oath, to a tribunal constituted for the purpose, and pursuing certain steps prescribed in the law, shall be discharged, and all his property shall be vested in the sheriff, for the benefit of the creditors at whose suit he is in execution.</p>
<p>In the case at bar, the forms of the law were observed, and a certificate of discharge obtained, after which the debtor departed from the rules. Conceiving this discharge to have been obtained by fraud, the creditor brought a suit upon the bond, and the court instructed the jury, that if a fraud had been practised by the debtor, although neither the justices who granted the certificate, nor the security, partook thereof, yet it avoided the discharge, and left the security liable in this action. To this opinion the defendants' counsel excepted, and upon that exception the cause is before this court.</p>
<p>The certificate of discharge may be granted either by the court sitting in its ordinary character for the transaction of judicial business, or by two magistrates who are constituted by law an extraordinary court for this particular purpose. Whether granted in the one mode or the other, it is of equal validity. In either case, the judgment of discharge is the judgment of a court, and, as such, is of complete obligation.</p>
<p>The judgments of a court of competent jurisdiction, although obtained by fraud, have never been considered as absolutely void; and therefore, all acts performed under them are valid, so far as respects third persons. A <span class="star-pagination">*307</span> sheriff who levies an execution under a judgment fraudulently obtained, is not a trespasser, nor can the person who purchases at a sale under such an execution, be compelled to relinquish the property he has purchased. All acts performed under such a judgment are valid acts; all the legal consequences which follow a judgment are, with respect to third persons, precisely the same in one obtained by fraud, as if it had been obtained fairly.</p>
<p>When the person who has committed the fraud attempts to avail himself of the act, so as to discharge himself from a previously existing obligation, or to acquire a benefit, the judgment thus obtained is declared void as to that purpose; but it may well be doubted, whether a penalty would be incurred, even by the person committing the fraud, for an act which the judgment would sanction. Thus, if a debtor taken on mesne process escapes, he may be retaken by the authority of the sheriff, and if not retaken, the sheriff may be liable for an escape; but if he fraudulently obtains a judgment in his favour, in consequence of which he goes at large, it has never been imagined that the sheriff could retake him on suspicion that the judgment was fraudulent, or be liable for an escape on the proof of such fraud.</p>
<p>Thus too, where, as in Virginia, an injunction has been adjudged to discharge the body from confinement, if a debtor in execution, by false allegations, obtains an injunction whereby his body is discharged from prison, or from the rules, it has never been conjectured that the injunction thus awarded was void, and the acts performed under it were to be considered as if the injunction had not existed. In that case, it would not be alleged that there was an escape, and that the security to the bond for keeping the rules was liable for the debt, because the discharge was fraudulently obtained; but the discharge would have all its legal effects, in like manner as if no imposition had been practiced on the judge by whom it was granted.</p>
<p>The judgment rendered in his favour may not shield the fraudulent debtor from an original claim, but it is believed that no case can be adduced, where an act, which is the legal consequence of a judgment, has in itself created a new responsibility, even with respect to the party <span class="star-pagination">*308</span> himself, much less with respect to third persons, who do not participate in the fraud.</p>
<p>It would seem, then, upon general principles, that a debtor who has departed from the prison-rules under the authority of a judgment of discharge, granted in due form by a competent tribunal, has not committed an escape even to charge himself, much less a third person. Such a discharge might not be permitted to protect him from the original debt, even if the case had not been particularly provided for by statute; but the act of departing from the rules, after being thus discharged, could not charge him with a new responsibility to which he was not before liable, much less will it impose on his security a liability for the debt. Departing from the rules, after being discharged in due course of law, is not a breach of the condition of his bond.</p>
<p>This opinion receives great additional strength from those arguments, drawn from the objects and provisions of the act, which have been forcibly urged from the bar.</p>
<p>The objects of the act unquestionably are, not to increase the security of the creditor, but to relieve the debtor from close imprisonment in the confined jails of the country, and to consult his health, by giving him the benefit of fresh air. But as this indulgence would furnish the means of escaping from the custody of the officer, and thereby deprive the creditor of his person, it was thought necessary to guard against the danger which the indulgence itself created, not to guard against dangers totally unconnected with this indulgence. Security, therefore, ought, in reason, to be required against a departure from the rules without a lawful authority so to do, because the means of such departure were furnished by being allowed the use of the rules; but security against a fraud in obtaining such authority need not be required, because the means of practising that fraud are not facilitated by granting the rules. They may be used by a debtor in close jail, as successfully as by a debtor admitted to the rules.</p>
<p>It is also a material circumstance in the construction of the act, that ample provision is made for the very case. <span class="star-pagination">*309</span> A new capias may be awarded to take the person of the debtor. This remedy is not allowed in the case of an escape; and it is strong evidence that the legislature did not contemplate a departure from the rules, under a certificate issued by proper authority, as an escape; that the remedy given the creditor is competent to a redress of the injury, replaces him in the situation in which he was before it was committed, and is not founded on the idea that there has been an escape.</p>
<p>The argument founded on the provisions respecting the property of the debtor, also bear strongly on the case. They confirm the opinion, that a departure from the rules, under a certificate of discharge granted by a proper tribunal, ought not to be considered as an escape. So, too, does that provision of the act which requires notice to the creditor and not to the security.</p>
<p>Without reviewing the various additional arguments which have been suggested at the bar, the court is of opinion, that upon general principles, strengthened by a particular consideration of the act itself, a departure from the rules under such an authority as is stated in the proceedings, is not an escape which can charge the security in the bond for keeping the prison-rules, although that authority was obtained by a fraudulent representation on the part of the debtor, neither the magistrates nor the security having participated in that fraud.</p>
<p>There is error, therefore, in the instruction given to the jury, as stated in the third bill of exceptions, for which the judgment is to be reversed, and the cause remanded for further trial.</p>
<p>Judgment reversed.</p>
<p>PATERSON, J. As to the third exception, which embraces the main point in the cause, my opinion differs from the opinion of the majority of the court, and accords with the direction given by the court below. The condition of the bond is, "that Simms do well and truly keep himself within the prison-rules, and thence not to depart until he shall be discharged by due course of law, or pay the sum of 1,285 dollars and 45 cents, to George Slacum, <span class="star-pagination">*310</span> assignee," &amp;c. The act that will not exonerate the principal, will not exonerate the surety, from the obligation which they have entered into; for the surety stands on the same floor as the principal, and assumes the like character of responsibility, in regard to the terms specified in the condition of the bond. The benefit of the act of insolvency, if obtained by fraud or perjury on the part of Simms, will be unavailing, and his going beyond the limits of the prison, in consequence or under colour of a discharge, thus procured, will be an invalid and unwarrantable departure. Fraud infects the decision; and the legal principle is, that the fraudulent person shall not be suffered to protect himself by his own fraudulent act. If he should, then a judgment, which is laid in fraud, will, as in the present case, operate to the extinction of a legal, pre-existing obligation or contract. But a discharge, fraudulently obtained, is of no virtue Â— of no operation; and is, in truth and in law, no discharge; it has neither legal effect, nor even legal existence as to the party himself, and the surety, who stands in his shoes. If the judgment be of no avail as to the principal, it will be of no avail as to the surety; it cannot be ineffectual as to the one, and operative as to the other. The discharge must be legal to be valid, and to exonerate the surety from the special condition of the bond. The judgment itself is a fraud on the law; and I can discern no difference between the debtor's going beyond the prison-bounds voluntarily, or under colour of a judgment so obtained; except, that the latter is a case of deeper die, and less excusable in a legal and moral view than the former.</p>
<p>Although Simms is liable to be imprisoned by virtue of a new process, yet he may have gone out of the jurisdiction of the court; or if not, Slacum will be deprived of the benefit of the bond which Simms and Wise executed.</p>
<p>The sheriff stands on different ground; for he is exonerated from all liability, by an express provision in the statute. Besides, if the justices have jurisdiction of the subject, and should not exceed their jurisdiction, it is not incumbent on the sheriff to examine into the regularity, fairness, and validity of their proceedings and judgment; he looks at the instrument of discharge, which, emanating <span class="star-pagination">*311</span> from a competent authority, it is his duty to obey. But though the discharge may excuse the sheriff, as an officer of the court, it will not excuse the party, nor his surety. As to them, it is inoperative, and of no legal efficacy.</p>

That upon that suit judgment was rendered, by the court of Hustings, for Dunlap against Harris, from which judgment he appealed to the Dumfries district court, where the judgment of the court of Hustings was reversed,<a class="footnote" href="#fn-s" id="fn-s_ref">*</a> and Dunlap appealed from the judgment of the district court, to the court of appeals, where the judgment of the district court was affirmed.</p>

<p class="indent">The defendant, on the trial of the present suit, also offered evidence to prove, that the said John Dunlap, on the 19th of April, 1798, also commenced suit against Towers, upon his indorsement of the same note, which suit is still pending in the court below. That the said John Dunlap is the same Dunlap whose name is mentioned at the head of the bill of parcels aforesaid, and who is still living.</p>

<p class="indent">Whereupon, the defendant prayed the court to instruct the jury, that upon proof of these circumstances, the plaintiff could not recover, in this action, for goods sold and delivered; and that, from the bill and receipt given as aforesaid, the transaction must be considered as a joint contract. Which instruction the court refused to give, as prayed, but directed the jury, that the bill of parcels, before mentioned, is evidence (but not conclusive) of a joint contract of sale for the rum and sugar; and that the plaintiff may explain the transaction by parol, or other evidence, to prove that he was the sole owner of the sugar, and that the said Dunlap was the sole owner of the rum, and that the contract for the sale of the sugar was made with the plaintiff in his own right, and that the contract for the sale of the rum was made with him as agent for Dunlap. But if the plaintiff should produce no such explanatory evidence, he could not maintain the present action.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p8">
<span class="num">8</span>
<p class="indent">And the court further instructed the jury, that if they should be satisfied, that the contract of sale was made with the plaintiff alone, and that part of the goods was the sole property of the plaintiff, and that the residue was the sole property of Dunlap; and that the plaintiff had authority from Dunlap to sell such residue; then the plaintiff had a right to recover judgment in this action against the defendant, for the whole amount of the goods so sold and delivered; and <i>that the other facts stated are not sufficient to bar the plaintiff</i>.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p9">
<span class="num">9</span>
<p class="indent">The 2d bill of exceptions in the present cause, stated, that the plaintiff produced a witness, who proved, that the sale of the goods was made in the store of Dunlap, where the goods were deposited; that he never knew Dunlap to claim any title to the sugar, nor the plaintiff to the rum; and that, previous to the sale, Dunlap claimed the rum as his separate property, and the plaintiff claimed the sugar as his separate property; and that Dunlap requested the plaintiff to sell the rum with the plaintiff's sugar. Whereupon, the plaintiff prayed the court to instruct the jury, that the evidence so offered was not competent to contradict or explain the purport of the bill of parcels and receipt, or to show that the plaintiff sold part of the goods as his separate property, and the residue as agent of Dunlap; and that it did not amount to proof of such several property and agency, as could enable the plaintiff to recover, in this action, for the whole of the goods sold.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p10">
<span class="num">10</span>

<p class="indent">2d. Whether, under the other circumstances of the case, the plaintiff could recover in this action?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>C. Lee</i>, and <i>Jones</i>, for plaintiff in error.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p16">
<span class="num">16</span>
<p class="indent">1. The bill of parcels is <i>written evidence</i>, purporting a joint contract, and cannot be contradicted by parol.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p17">
<span class="num">17</span>
<p class="indent">The action ought to have been joint. The bill of exceptions does not state any evidence from which the jury could infer, that part of the goods was the sole property of one, and the residue the sole property of the other. The circumstances offered to prove that fact were too slight to justify the inference, and the court ought to have instructed the jury to that effect.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p18">
<span class="num">18</span>
<p class="indent">2. The contract which arose on the sale of the goods has been changed to a special contract, to pay on a certain condition: viz. if the plaintiff shall use due diligence to get the money on the note, and shall not succeed. If the plaintiff negotiates the note, he receives its value; he is paid for the goods sold; he has received satisfaction, and can never resort to the defendant, until the note is returned to the plaintiff, and he has taken it up, and offered to return it to the defendant. Whatever would prevent the plaintiff from recovering against the defendant on the note, would equally prevent him from recovering on the contract for goods sold and delivered. The present suit was commenced while suits were depending on this very note, by Dunlap against the present defendant, and by Dunlap against Towers. The defendant cannot, at the same time, be answerable upon the note, and upon the original contract of sale.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p19">
<span class="num">19</span>
<p class="indent">The order which the court made, that the plaintiff should deliver up to the defendant, the note which had been filed in the case of Dunlap v. Harris, did not aid the judgment. The court had no authority to make such an order; the note was the property of Dunlap, and not of the plaintiff. But the note was of no use to the defendant. It was barred by the act of limitations, and that by the conduct of the plaintiff.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p20">
<span class="num">20</span>
<p class="indent">In the case of <i>Kearslake</i> v. <i>Morgan</i>, 5 <i>T. R.</i> 513, it is admitted by the counsel on both sides, that if a negotiable note, given for a prior simple contract debt, be indorsed over by the plaintiff, and is outstanding, the plaintiff cannot recover upon the original contract. In the present case, it must be presumed that the plaintiff received value for the note when he passed it to Dunlap, and it does not appear that he has ever been obliged to refund.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p21">
<span class="num">21</span>
<p class="indent"><i>Swann, E. J. Lee</i>, and <i>Simms</i>, contra. It does not appear that the note was not returned. But this court, in the case of <i>Clarke &amp; Young, ante, vol.</i> 1.<i>p.</i> 181, had decided, that it is not necessary, in such a case, to return it. So in the case of <i>Puckford</i> v. <i>Maxwell</i>, 6 <i>T. R.</i> 53, the court said, that 'in cases of this kind, if the bill, which is given in payment, do not turn out to be productive, it is not that which it purports to be, and which the party receiving it expects it to be, and, therefore, he may consider it as a nullity, and act as if no such bill had been given at all.' The same point is also decided in 1. <i>Esp. Rep.</i> 5, and 7 <i>T. R.</i> 64, <i>Owenson</i> v. <i>Morse</i>.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p22">
<span class="num">22</span>
<p class="indent">The question of negligence does not arise in this case. The reason of the admission in the case of <i>Kearslake</i> v. <i>Morgan</i>, that if the note was outstanding, the plaintiff could not recover upon the original cause of action, is, that the defendant would be liable to be <i>sued</i> upon it. The words are, '<i>if he may be sued upon it by a third person</i>.' But here the record itself shows that Harris could not be sued upon it by a third person, being only liable to the present plaintiff, who was his immediate indorsee, that point having been decided in the court of appeals in Virginia, upon this very note. As, therefore, Harris is liable upon the note to the present plaintiff only, and, as he will not be liable to <i>him</i> on the note, in case he recovers in the present action, it is the same thing as if the note had been taken up by the plaintiff, and ready to be delivered to the defendant.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p23">
<span class="num">23</span>
<p class="indent"><i>Jones</i>, in reply, admitted, that modern decisions have laid down the law broadly, that if the note or bill is not honoured, it is of no avail; but it is otherwise, if the note or bill be negotiated; it is then a payment until returned.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p24">
<span class="num">24</span>
<p class="indent">In the case of <i>Young &amp; Clarke</i>, the plaintiff had not negotiated the bill, and the parties answerable to Clarke were insolvent.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p25">
<span class="num">25</span>
<p class="indent">The liability of the defendant to a suit by a third person, on the note, is not the only ground of the opinion in <i>Kearslake</i> v. <i>Morgan</i>. Another ground is, that the defendant may have the benefit of the note against the parties answerable to him.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p26">

<p class="indent">This case comes up on two exceptions taken to opinions given in the circuit court.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p29">
<span class="num">29</span>
<p class="indent">The plaintiff in the court below had sold to the defendant in that court, certain goods, wares and merchandize, of which he had given him a bill, headed with the words, 'Mr. Theophilus Harris, bought of Dunlap &amp; Johnston,' &amp;c. At the foot of this bill of parcels, was the following receipt: 'Received, Messrs. Clingman and Magaw's note for the above sum, payable to the order of John Towers or order, indorsed by John Towers and Theophilus Harris, payable 2d April, 1798, when paid, received in full.'</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p30">
<span class="num">30</span>
<p class="indent">This note was indorsed in blank by the defendant in error, and a suit was instituted upon it by Dunlap against Harris, in which suit he ultimately failed, it being the law of Virginia, that on a note, an action by the indorsee can only be maintained against the drawer, or his immediate indorsor.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p31">
<span class="num">31</span>
<p class="indent">The defendant below objected,</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p32">
<span class="num">32</span>
<p class="indent">1st. That the bill of parcels was conclusive evidence of joint property in the goods sold and delivered, and, therefore, that the action was not maintainable in the name of Johnston alone.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p33">
<span class="num">33</span>
<p class="indent">2d. That no action was maintainable on the original contract, the plaintiff below having indorsed the note mentioned in the receipt, and not having re-acquired any property in it, so as to be able to restore it to Harris.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p34">
<span class="num">34</span>
<p class="indent">No <i>laches</i> are imputed, or are imputable to the holder of the note.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p35">
<span class="num">35</span>
<p class="indent">Both these points were decided against the defendant below, and a judgment was rendered against him, from which he has appealed to this court.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p36">
<span class="num">36</span>
<p class="indent">On the first point the court is of opinion, that there is no error. The written memorandum was not the contract, and was only given to show to what object the receipt at its foot applied. It is not, therefore, a bar to a disclosure of the real fact; it is not conclusive evidence of joint ownership in the property sold, and of a joint sale, but will admit of explanation. The court, therefore, did not err in allowing explanatory evidence to go to the jury, nor in allowing the jury to judge of the weight of that evidence.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p37">
<span class="num">37</span>
<p class="indent">On the 2d exception, the material point to be decided is, whether an action can be maintained on an original contract for goods sold and delivered, by a person who has received a note as a conditional payment, and has passed away that note.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p38">
<span class="num">38</span>
<p class="indent">Upon principle, it would appear that such an action could not be maintained. The indorsement of the note passes the property in it to another, and is evidence that it was sold for a valuable consideration.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p39">
<span class="num">39</span>
<p class="indent">If, after such indorsement, the seller of the goods could maintain an action on the original contract, he would receive double satisfaction.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p40">
<span class="num">40</span>
<p class="indent">The case cited from 5<i>th Term Reports</i>, appears to be precisely in point. The distinction taken by the counsel for the appellee, that in this case Harris can never be sued on the note, is not so substantial as it is ingenious. Harris has a right to the note, in order to have his recourse against his indorsee, and Johnston has not a right to obtain satisfaction for the goods from Harris, while he is in possession of the satisfaction received from Dunlap. In the case quoted from <i>Durnford &amp; East</i>, the liability of the defendant to an action from the actual holder of the note, is not the sole ground on which a disability to sue on the original contract was placed. That disability was also occasioned by the obvious injustice, of allowing to the same person a double satisfaction, and of withholding from the debtor, who had paid for the note before he could indorse it, and who would be compelled, by the judgment, to pay for the goods, on account of which he had parted with it, the right of resorting to his indorsor. But, if it was indispensable to show, that <i>Dunlap</i> has a remedy against Harris, it is supposed, that the holder of a note may incontestibly sue a remote indorsor in chancery, and compel payment of it.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p41">
<span class="num">41</span>
<p class="indent">The case of <i>Young &amp; Clarke</i>, decided in this court, does not apply, because, in that case, the plaintiff below had not parted with his property in the note.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p42">
<span class="num">42</span>
<p class="indent">The court does not think that the order (made after the judgment was rendered) for the rendition of the note to the defendant below, can correct the error committed in misdirecting the jury.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p43">
<span class="num">43</span>
<p class="indent">The judgment is to be reversed, for error in directing the jury that the action was maintainable on the original contract, after the note received as conditional payment had been indorsed.</p>
</div>
<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote" id="fn-s">
<a class="footnote" href="#fn-s_ref">*</a>
<p> It was understood and admitted by the counsel on both sides, that the judgment was reversed because the court was of opinion, that, in Virginia, the holder of an indorsed promissory note, payable to order, cannot strike out an intermediate blank indorsement, and fill up the blank indorsement of a remote indorsor, with an order to pay the money to himself; and that the holder cannot maintain an action against any of the parties to the note, but his own immediate indorsor, or the maker of the note.</p>
</div>
<div class="footnote" id="fn-s-s">
<a class="footnote" href="#fn-s-s_ref">**</a>
<p> The record does not state the whole order of the court upon the motion for a new trial. The court, upon further argument and consideration, being doubtful whether the plaintiff could support this action, until he had got back the note from Dunlap, informed the plaintiff's counsel, that they would grant a new trial, unless the plaintiff would get that note, and return it to the defendant, and also obtain a release from Dunlap to Harris, of all right of action for the rum sold.</p>

<p class="indent">ERROR to the circuit court of the district of Columbia, upon a judgment in favour of the defendants, upon a general demurrer to their plea, which (after <i>oyer</i> of the plaintiff's letters testamentary) stated, that the defendants' testator, at the time of making the promises, &amp;c. and from thence, always, until his death, resided in the town of Alexandria, in the county of Alexandria, in the district of Columbia, and that the defendants have always resided in the same town, and that the plaintiffs have not obtained probat of the said letters testamentary, at any place within the district of Columbia, or the United States of America.</p>

<p class="indent">There is nothing in the laws of Virginia, which requires that letters testamentary should be there taken out upon a foreign will, provided they have been taken out in the country where the testator lived and died.

<span class="num">8</span>
<p class="indent">The case of <i>Fenwick</i> v. <i>Sears, ante, vol.</i> 1. <i>p.</i> 259, was that of an administrator who derives his whole authority from the laws of the place; it therefore cannot decide the present case, which is that of an executor who derives his whole authority from the will of his testator. That case, too, was decided under the peculiar laws of Maryland, which differ from those of Virginia upon this subject. <i>By the law of Maryland</i>, 1798, <i>ch.</i> 101, Â§ 4, no alien can be an executor or administrator.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p9">
<span class="num">9</span>
<p class="indent">But it is said, that the rights of creditors require that the executor should give security for the faithful administration of the estate. But this would be of no avail, if the executor, after giving security, should choose to return to England. For, according to the decision of the court of appeals of Virginia, in the case of <i>Baylor's executors</i>, a creditor cannot maintain an action against the sureties of an executor, until he has proved his debt by an action and judgment against the executor, and proved a <i>devastavit</i> also, by a suit. But he can never get a judgment against an executor, who is not found in the state; and, consequently, can never have judgment against the surety. But if an executor be absent, the creditor may, in chancery, attach the assets. A voluntary payment to an executor, without letters testamentary, in Virginia, is good. Why, then, should not the executor be permitted to sue?</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p10">
<span class="num">10</span>
<p class="indent">If no purpose of justice is to be answered by refusing the right to sue; and, if it is not refused by the positive laws of Virginia, a strong argument may be drawn from the inconvenience of obliging an executor to procure letters testamentary in every state in the union, and, perhaps, for very trifling debts.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p11">
<span class="num">11</span>
<p class="indent"><i>Swann</i>, contra. The case of <i>Fenwick</i> v. <i>Sears</i>, has settled the question, as to a foreign administrator. In what does that differ from the case of a foreign executor? It is said, that the latter derives his authority from the will, which is an universal title. But the authority under the will is inchoate, until completed by the probat, and is limited to very few acts. It is certain, that an executor, before probat, cannot obtain a judgment. The ordinary in England, and the court in Virginia, may refuse an executor, who is under a disability; for example, an alien enemy; an infant under seventeen; an ideot, &amp; c. Until, therefore, he is received, his capacity to act is not decided by the only competent tribunal.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p12">
<span class="num">12</span>
<p class="indent">In England, the ordinary cannot require security from an executor, 2 <i>Bac. Ab.</i> 376, 377; it can only be done by the court of chancery considering him as a trustee, when there is good ground to apprehend his wasting the estate. In Virginia, the interest of creditors, legatees and distributees, is attended to. Yet their interest might be destroyed, if the executor was permitted to receive money, or give an acquittance before he had given security. It is, therefore, questionable, whether an executor, in Virginia, can do any valid act, until he has qualified himself according to law.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p13">
<span class="num">13</span>
<p class="indent">It is also doubtful whether the assets can be attached, 3 <i>Wilson</i>, 297; for that would invert the order of administration. If they cannot, a foreign executor might, by his attorney, withdraw all the assets, and leave the creditors without remedy. A judgment-creditor here would have a preference. But if he sues in England upon a judgment of this country, his claim is reduced to a simple contract.</p>

Security ought not to be required here, if not required in England; and if taken in England, it ought not to be required here. (See <i>Target's</i> opinion upon the <i>Dutchess of Kingston's</i> will, in <i>collectanea juridica</i>.) [323]</p>

<p class="indent">MARSHALL, Ch. J. delivered the opinion of the court.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p20">
<span class="num">20</span>
<p class="indent">The question in this case is, whether the executor of a person who dies in a foreign country, can maintain an action in this, by virtue of letters testamentary, granted to him in his own country.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p21">
<span class="num">21</span>
<p class="indent">It is contended, that this case differs from that of an administrator, which was formerly decided in this court, because an administrator derives his power over the estate of his intestate, from the grant of the administration; but an executor derives it from the will of his testator, which has invested him with his whole personal estate, wherever it may be.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p22">
<span class="num">22</span>
<p class="indent">This distinction does certainly exist; but the consequences deduced from it, do not seem to follow. If an executor derived from the will of his testator, a power to maintain a suit, and obtain a judgment for a debt due to his testator, it would seem reasonable that he should exercise that power, wherever the authority of the will was acknowledged; but if he maintains the suit by virtue of his letters testamentary, he can only sue in courts to which the power of those letters extends. It is not, and cannot be denied, that he sues by virtue of his letters testamentary; and consequently, in this particular, he comes within the principle which was decided by the court, in the case of an administrator.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p23">
<span class="num">23</span>
<p class="indent">All rights to personal property are admitted to be regulated by the laws of the country in which the testator lived; but the suits for those rights must be governed by the laws of that country in which the tribunal is placed. No man can sue in the courts of any country, whatever his rights may be, unless in conformity with the rules prescribed by the laws of that country.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p24">
<span class="num">24</span>
<p class="indent">The court can perceive the inconvenience which may often result from this principle, but it is an inconvenience for which no remedy is within the reach of this tribunal.</p>

<p class="indent">Negro London brought an action of assault and battery against Scott, to try his right to freedom. His claim was grounded upon the act of assembly of Virginia, of the 17th December, 1792, <i>P. P.</i> 186; the 2<i>d section</i> of which is in these words: 'Slaves which shall hereafter be brought into this commonwealth, and kept therein one whole year together, or so long at different times as shall amount to one year, shall be free.'</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p3">
<span class="num">3</span>
<p class="indent">The 3<i>d section</i> imposes a penalty upon every person importing slaves contrary to the act.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p4">
<span class="num">4</span>
<p class="indent">The 4<i>th section</i> is in these words: 'Provided, that nothing in this act contained, shall be construed to extend to those who may incline to remove from any of the United States, and become citizens of this, if, within sixty days <i>after such removal</i>, he or she shall take the following oath, before some justice of the peace of this commonwealth: 'I, A. B. do swear, that my removal into the state of Virginia was with no intent of evading the laws for preventing the further importation of slaves, <i>nor have I brought with me any slaves</i> with an intention of selling them, nor have any of the slaves which I have brought with me, been imported from Africa, or any of the West-India islands, since the first day of November, one thousand seven hundred and seventy-eight. So help me God.'</p>

<p class="indent">'Nor to any person claiming slaves by descent, marriage or devise; nor to any citizens of this commonwealth being now the actual owners of slaves within any of the United States, and removing such hither; nor to travellers or others making a transient stay, and bringing slaves for necessary attendance, and carrying them out again.'</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p6">
<span class="num">6</span>
<p class="indent">The defendant below took a bill of exceptions, which stated, in substance, the following facts:</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p7">
<span class="num">7</span>
<p class="indent">The defendant's father, <i>claiming to own the plaintiff as his slave</i>, brought him from Maryland into Alexandria, in July, 1802, without the knowledge or consent of the defendant, and hired him out in Alexandria until his death, which happened about Christmas in the same year. The plaintiff has continued to reside in Alexandria until the present time, except about three weeks in April, 1803. The defendant's father never took the oath required by the 4th section of the act. The defendant, in March, 1803, got possession of the plaintiff, and in April following, being then a resident of Maryland, but intending to remove to Alexandria, hired him out in Alexandria, claiming him as his slave, under a bill of sale from Thomas Contee, dated the 3d of September, 1800. The defendant came from Maryland in June, 1803, and on the 5th of July next following, took the oath prescribed by the 4th section of the act. Whereupon, the court instructed the jury, that if they should be of opinion, from the evidence, that the <i>defendant's father</i> brought the plaintiff from the state of Maryland into the county of Alexandria in the year 1802, <i>and exercised acts of ownership over the plaintiff, and hired him out as his slave</i>, and that the plaintiff has been kept in the county of Alexandria one whole year, or so long at different times as amount to a whole year, from the importation to the bringing of the action, and that no other oath was made than that which the defendant has offered in evidence as aforesaid, then the plaintiff is entitled to his freedom, <i>although the jury should be satisfied that he was the property of the defendant at the time he was so brought into the town of Alexandria</i>.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p8">
<span class="num">8</span>
<p class="indent"><i>E. J. Lee</i>, for the plaintiff in error. At the time the plaintiff in error took the oath, the negro had not been kept a year in the county of Alexandria; the forfeiture had not accrued; the oath was taken within sixty days after the removal of his owner. The importation by the father, without the knowledge or consent of his son, the owner, did not oblige the latter to take the oath within sixty days after such importation. The act is penal, and is, therefore, to be construed strictly. No prosecution against the son, for the penalty under the third section of the act, could have been maintained, upon such an importation by the father. The oath by the son would have been a good defence. The act does not say it shall be taken within sixty days after the importation of the slave, but within sixty days after the removal of the owner.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p9">
<span class="num">9</span>
<p class="indent">The opinion of the court below was, that the oath ought to have been taken within sixty days after the removal of the negro.<a class="footnote" href="#fn-s" id="fn-s_ref">*</a></p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p10">
<span class="num">10</span>
<p class="indent"><i>C. Lee</i>, contra. The general rule is, that a slave imported shall be free. Is the present case within the exception?</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p11">
<span class="num">11</span>
<p class="indent">The father, being in possession of the slave, claiming title and exercising authority as owner, brought him from Maryland into Alexandria. If if he did so without authority from the son, and if the son was the true owner, and if the slave was lost by the negligence, or in consequence of the act of the father, he is liable to the son. The father, therefore, was a person to whom the effects of the 2d section would extend, and to save himself from those effects, it was his duty to have taken the oath prescribed by the 4th section.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p12">
<span class="num">12</span>
<p class="indent">But it is clearly to be inferred from the 4th section taken together with the words of the oath, that the oath will protect the owner's title, only to such slaves as he shall <i>bring with him</i> when he comes to reside in Virginia. The words are, that nothing in the act shall extend to him who may incline to remove, if, within sixty days after '<i>such removal</i>,' he shall make oath that he has not '<i>brought with him any slaves</i>,' with an intention of selling them. It is not meant to say, that the slave must come in at the same instant with the owner, but it must be all part of one transaction. The <i>son</i> never <i>brought</i> the slave into Alexandria. He was not brought with the intent of residing here with the son.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p13">
<span class="num">13</span>
<p class="indent">Suppose the son had never come to reside in Alexandria, and the slave had been kept by the father, in Alexandria, more than a year, what could prevent the slave from obtaining his freedom? Could it be objected, that the father was not the true owner, and that the slave was kept there without the knowledge and consent of the son? Again, suppose the son had not come till after the slave had been kept in Alexandria a year by the father, and the son should then, within sixty days after his removal, take the oath, would that destroy the slave's right to freedom? If it would not, it must be because the son could not connect the importation of the slave, with his own removal. Why could he not connect an importation made <i>thirteen months</i> before his removal, as well as an importation made <i>eleven months</i> before his removal? Is it because a right to freedom had vested in the slave before the removal of the son? That cannot be; because the proviso says, that <i>nothing</i> in the act contained, shall extend to those who may incline to remove, if, within sixty days after <i>such removal</i>, they will take the oath. The word <i>nothing</i> refers as well to the year's residence, as to the first importation of the slave. It might be said, therefore, that the son did <i>incline</i> to remove; and within sixty days after <i>such removal</i>, did take the oath, and, therefore, he is not to be affected by the year's residence. The length to which this argument may be carried, shows its sophistry. It leads to the entire destruction of the 2d section of the act; for if the true owner may come, and make oath after one year, he may after fifty. The proviso, therefore, must be limited to an importation of the slave <i>with his owner</i>. Upon this construction, it will read thus: 'Provided that nothing in this act shall extend to those who shall remove <i>with their slaves</i>, and who shall, within sixty days after such removal, take the oath.'</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p14">
<span class="num">14</span>
<p class="indent">But the son did not remove <i>with his slave</i>, and, therefore, is not within the benefit of the proviso.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p15">
<span class="num">15</span>
<p class="indent"><i>Jones</i>, in reply. A slave does not, under this act, gain his freedom, unless he was brought in by his <i>true owner</i>. The acquisition of freedom by the slave, is a part of the penalty upon the owner, for violating the law. The freedom can only be acquired in a case where the owner is liable to the penalty of 200 dollars, under the 3d section.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p16">
<span class="num">16</span>
<p class="indent">When the owner and the slave do not come in at the same time, the sixty days begin to run from the time of the removal of the master. If the owner comes before the slave has resided one year in Virginia, it is sufficient.</p>

<p class="indent">MARSHALL, Ch. J. delivered the opinion of the court.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p18">
<span class="num">18</span>
<p class="indent">This case arises under a clause, in an act of the Virginia assembly, giving freedom to slaves who shall be brought thereafter into that state, and kept therein one whole year together, or so long at different times as shall amount to one year; and under a proviso of the same act, that it shall not extend to any person who may incline to remove from any of the United States, and become citizens of this, if, within sixty days after such removal, he shall take an oath which is prescribed in the act.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p19">
<span class="num">19</span>
<p class="indent">The negro London was brought from Maryland into Alexandria, where he was hired out, in the year 1802; some months after which, his master, the plaintiff in error, also removed into Alexandria, and within the year from the time the negro was brought in, and alse within the sixty days from the time the plaintiff in error removed to Alexandria, the oath prescribed by the law was taken.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p20">
<span class="num">20</span>
<p class="indent">No right to freedom having vested in London at the time this oath was taken, the question is, has it brought the plaintiff within the proviso of the act?</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p21">
<span class="num">21</span>
<p class="indent">That the plaintiff is within the letter of the proviso, is unquestionable. He is a person who inclined to remove from one of the United States, into Virginia, who actually did remove, and who took the requisite oath within the limited time.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p22">
<span class="num">22</span>
<p class="indent">But it is contended, in behalf of the defendant in error, that the acts of bringing the negro into the state, and of removing into it, must be concomitant, in order to bring the case within the proviso: Or in other words, that the owner must be a person 'inclining to remove into the state,' at the time the slave was brought in. This inaccuracy of construction seems to be founded on the idea, that the penalty of forfeiting the property, accrues on bringing the slave into the state, whereas, it attaches on his continuance in the state for twelve months. Till such continuance has taken place, the offence has not been committed. If then, all the acts which bring a person within the proviso, are performed before the right to freedom is vested, and before the provisions of the act have been infracted, it seems to the court, that the rights of the party remain unaffected by the act.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p23">
<span class="num">23</span>
<p class="indent">If London had been ordered to Maryland for a day, and then brought with his master into Alexandria, the construction of his counsel would be satisfied; and it seems strange, where the letter of a law has not been violated, that such an unimportant circumstance should affect its spirit.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p24">
<span class="num">24</span>
<p class="indent">Unless this mode be admitted, of coming within the proviso, a person inclining to remove into Virginia, whose slaves had preceded him, though not for one year, could not bring himself within, or avoid the forfeiture, although permitting them to come into that state was no offence; a construction of the act which the court cannot think consistent with its spirit or letter.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p25">
<span class="num">25</span>
<p class="indent">This court is, therefore, of opinion, that the circuit court erred in directing the jury that, under the circumstances stated, the plaintiff below was entitled to his freedom, and doth reverse the judgment rendered by the circuit court, and remand the cause for further proceedings.</p>
</div>

<p> The opinion of the court below seems to have been misunderstood by the counsel. The grounds upon which that court decided, are believed to be, not that the <i>son</i> was bound to take the oath within sixty days after the removal of the slave by the father, but that the <i>father</i> ought to have taken the oath within sixty days after <i>his</i> removal with the slave. The act does not require the oath to be taken by the person who has the absolute property of the slave, but by him who brings a slave into the state. The words of the oath are, 'nor have I brought <i>with me any</i> slaves with an intention of selling them.' The <i>son</i> might safely take the oath, and sell the slave immediately, for he did <i>not</i> bring the slave with him. The son would not have been liable to the penalty of 200 dollars under the 3d section, because he did <i>not</i> import the slave: but the <i>father</i> would, because he <i>did</i> import him.</p>
<p>The right to freedom which the slave acquires is not a mere penalty on the owner, but an independent right, not to be controuled by its consequences. The object of the act was to discourage, and gradually to abolish <i>slawery;</i> or, at least, to prevent its increase. Two means were adopted by the legislature. One was the prevention of further importations; the other was the emancipation of such as should be imported contrary to the act. This emancipation was not a <i>penalty</i> intended solely to <i>prevent</i> importation, but a <i>specific remedy</i> for the evil <i>after it had happened</i>. The penalty of 200 dollars, under the 3d section, was the <i>preventive</i> means, and the emancipation, under the 2d section, was the <i>remedial</i> means of accomplishing the object of the legislature. The evil was not the importation of freemen, but of <i>slaves</i>. To make slaves free was, therefore, as direct an accomplishment of their object, as to prevent their importation. The act could not intend that the right to freedom, given by the 2d section, should depend upon a title litigated between two persons, each claiming to be the owner. The words are, 'Slaves which shall hereafter be <i>brought</i> into this commonwealth'â€”not by their <i>owners</i>, but by any person claiming and exercising authority over them. If a stranger should take a slave from Maryland, claiming title, and bring him into Virginia, and keep him there a year, the slave must, under the 2d section of the act, be free. And the remedy of the true owner must be against the wrong doer, in the same manner as against a man who should, without authority, take his slave from Maryland, and in attempting to cross the Potowmack, the slave should be drowned. So, in this case, if the father, without authority from the son, brought the slave from Maryland into Alexandria, and the slave thereby gains his freedom, by the negligence of the father, the father is liable to the son. The right of the slave to his freedom does not depend upon the crime of the person who may in law be adjudged to be the true owner. It is sufficient for the slave to show that the person, in whose <i>possession</i>, and under whose <i>controul</i> he was, and who <i>claimed</i> and <i>exercised</i> over him the authority of an owner, has violated the law, and done the act which, by law, confers upon him his freedom. The consequential damage to the true owner cannot affect the slave. <i>He</i> was not the cause of the injury. The true owner must look to the author of the injury, against whom the laws have provided him a remedy.</p>

<p class="indent">ERROR to the circuit court of the district of Columbia, in an action of trespass <i>vi et armis</i>, for entering the plaintiff's house, and taking away his goods. The defendant justified as collector of militia fines. The plaintiff replied, that at the time when, &amp;c. he was one of the United States justices of the peace, for the county of Alexandria. This replication, upon a general demurrer, was, by a majority of the court below, adjudged bad; whereupon the plaintiff sued out a writ of error, and the questions made on the argument were,</p>
<p class="indent">1. Whether a justice of the peace, for the county of Alexandria, was liable to do militia duty? and</p>
<p class="indent">2. Whether an action of trespass will lie against the officer who makes distress, for a fine assessed upon a justice of the peace by a court martial?</p>
<p class="indent"><i>C. Lee</i>, for the plaintiff in error. This case depends upon the act of congress of <i>March</i> 3<i>d</i>, 1803, entitled 'an act, more effectually to provide for the organization of the militia of the district of Columbia,' <i>vol.</i> 6, <i>p.</i> 237.</p>
<p class="indent">The 6th section says, 'that the commanding officers of companies, shall enrol every able bodied white male, between the ages of eighteen and forty-five years, (<i>except such as are exempt from military duty, by the laws of the United States</i>) resident within his district.'</p>
<p class="indent">The act of congress of the 8<i>th of May</i>, 1792, <i>vol.</i> 2, <i>p.</i> 93, Â§ 2, exempts from militia duty, 'The Vice-President of the United States; <i>the officers, judicial and executive, of the government of the United States;</i> the members of both houses of congress, and their respective officers; all custom-house officers, with their clerks; all post-officers, and stage-drivers, who are employed in the care and conveyance of the mail of the post-office of the United States; all ferrymen, employed at any ferry on the post-road; all inspectors of exports; all pilots; all mariners actually employed in the sea-service of any citizen or merchant within the United States; and all persons who now are, or may hereafter be, exempted by the laws of the respective states.'</p>
<p class="indent">This act applies not only to such officers as then existed, but to all such as might thereafter be created.</p>
<p class="indent">If the plaintiff is an officer, judicial or executive, of the government of the United States, he is exempted.</p>
<p class="indent">In <i>Marbury's case, ante, vol.</i> 1, <i>p.</i> 168, this court decided, that a justice of the peace, for the district of Columbia, was an officer, and that he became such as soon as the commission was signed, sealed, and ready to be delivered. If the commission, therefore, is a criterion, to decide who is an officer, we are at a loss to conceive what objection can be taken.</p>
<p class="indent">The justices of the peace for the district of Columbia, are appointed by the president of the United States, by and with the advice and consent of the senate, and are commissioned by the president. Their powers and duties are prescribed by the act of congress, 'concerning the district of Columbia, <i>vol.</i> 5, <i>p.</i> 271, Â§ 11. Whether those powers are judicial or executive, or both, is immaterial.</p>
<p class="indent"><i>Jones</i>, contra.</p>
<p class="indent">1. A justice of the peace, in the district of Columbia, is not a <i>judicial</i> officer of the <i>government</i> of the United States.</p>
<p class="indent">By the act of congress, those appointed for the county of Alexandria, are to exercise the same powers and duties as justices of the peace in Virginia. The expression in the act of 1792, 'officers judicial of the government of the United States,' means only the judges of the supreme and inferior courts of the United States. Justices of the peace in the states are not considered as judicial officers. By the constitution of Massachusetts, the judicial officers are to hold their offices during good behaviour, and yet the commissions of justices of the peace are limited to seven years. So the constitution of the United States says, that the judges, both of the supreme and inferior courts, shall hold their offices during good behaviour; but by the act of congress, the justices of the peace in the district of Columbia, are to hold their offices only for five years. These justices, therefore, are either not judges, or the constitution has, in this respect, been violated. It is plain, however, that congress did not consider then as judges. A sheriff sometimes acts as a judicial officer in holding elections; and some of the officers in the executive departments, exercise judicial functions in many cases, but they are not, therefore, judges. An act of congress may give judicial powers to certain officers, but they are not, therefore, judges.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p1">
<span class="num">1</span>
<p class="indent">2. He is not an executive officer 'of the <i>government</i> of the United States.' This description was intended, by the act of 1792, to comprehend only the officers of the superior departments, or those which strictly constitute the government of the United States, in its limited sense. This is to be inferred, because the act goes on to enumerate by name, all the inferior officers which it meant to exempt. Why <i>enumerate</i>, if the general description comprehended the whole?</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p2">
<span class="num">2</span>
<p class="indent">3. The circuit court of the district of Columbia has not jurisdiction of this question. The question who is to be enrolled in the militia, and the assessment of the fines, are matters submitted exclusively to the courts martial, which are courts of peculiar and extraordinary jurisdiction, specially appointed for that purpose, by the act of congress, <i>vol.</i> 6, <i>p.</i> 244, Â§ 8. The words are, the 'presiding officer shall lay before the said court (the battalion court of inquiry) all the delinquencies as directed by law, whereupon, they shall proceed <i>to hear and determine</i>.' There is no provision for revising the decisions of those courts martial.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p3">
<span class="num">3</span>
<p class="indent">They are final and conclusive, like those of an ecclesiastical court, or a court of admiralty.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p4">
<span class="num">4</span>
<p class="indent">If they have jurisdiction, and especially if they have exclusive and final jurisdiction in the case, the officer who executes their orders is justified. He cannot be considered as a trespasser.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p5">
<span class="num">5</span>
<p class="indent"><i>C. Lee</i>, in reply. There can be no doubt but the plaintiff is an officer. There can be as little that he is an officer judicial or executive, or both; and if he is not an officer of the government of the United States, he is not the officer of any other government. There is no distinction between an officer of the United States, and an officer of the <i>government</i> of the United States. An officer appointed by the president of the United States, to an office created by a law of the United States, and exercising his authority in the name of the United States, must be as much an officer of the government of the United states, as any other officer in the United States.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p6">
<span class="num">6</span>
<p class="indent">The reason by enumerating other officers by name, was, because it might, perhaps, be doubted, whether they would come under the general description of officers judicial and executive.</p>

<span class="num">8</span>
<p class="indent">Whenever a peculiar limited jurisdiction is given to certain persons, and they exceed it, not only their officers, but they themselves are liable to an action.

<p class="indent">In this case two points have been made by the plaintiff in error.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p12">
<span class="num">12</span>
<p class="indent">1st. That a justice of the peace, in the district of Columbia, is, by the laws of the United States, exempt from militia duty.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p13">
<span class="num">13</span>
<p class="indent">2d. That an action of trespass lies against the officer who makes distress, in order to satisfy a fine assessed upon a justice of the peace, by a court-martial.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p14">
<span class="num">14</span>
<p class="indent">1. Is a justice of the peace exempt from militia duty?</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p15">
<span class="num">15</span>
<p class="indent">The militia law of the district refers to the general law of the United States, and adopts the enumeration there made, of persons who have this privilege. That enumeration commences with 'the Vice-President of the United States, and the officers judicial and executive of the government of the United States.'</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p16">
<span class="num">16</span>
<p class="indent">It is contended by the plaintiff, and denied by the defendant, that a justice of the peace, within the district, is either a judicial or an executive officer of the government, in the sense in which those terms are used in the law.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p17">
<span class="num">17</span>
<p class="indent">It has been decided in this court, that a justice of the peace is an officer; nor can it be conceived, that the affirmative of this proposition, was it now undecided, could be controverted. Under the sanction of a law, he is appointed, by the president, by and with the advice and consent of the senate, and receives his commission from the president. We know not by what terms an officer can be defined, which would not embrace this description of persons. If he is an officer, he must be an officer under the government of the United States. Deriving all his authority from the legislature and president of the United States, he certainly is not the officer of any other government.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p18">
<span class="num">18</span>
<p class="indent">But it is contended, that he is not an officer in the sense of the militia law; that the meaning of the words 'judicial and executive officers of the government,' must be restricted to the officers immediately employed in the high judicial and executive departments; and, in support of this construction, the particular enumeration which follows those words, is relied on; an enumeration which, it is said, would have been useless, had the legislature used the words in the extended sense contended for by the plaintiff. A distinction has also been attempted between an officer of the United States, and an officer of the <i>government</i> of the United States, confining the latter more especially to those officers who are considered as belonging to the high departments; but, in this distinction, there does not appear to the court to be a solid difference. They are terms which may be used indifferently to express the same idea.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p19">
<span class="num">19</span>
<p class="indent">If a justice of the peace is an officer of the government of the United States, he must be either a judicial or an executive officer. In fact, his powers, as defined by law, seem partly judicial, and partly executive. He is, then, within the letter of the exemption, and of course must be considered as comprehended within its proper construction, unless there be something in the act which requires a contrary interpretation. The enumeration which follows this general description of officers, is urged as furnishing the guide which shall lead us to the more limited construction. But to this argument, it has very properly been answered, by the counsel for the plaintiff, that the long enumeration of characters exempted from militia duty which follows, presents only <i>one</i> description of persons; custom-house officers, and those who hold a commission from the President, or are appointed by him; and of these, by far the greater number do not hold such commission. The argument, therefore, not being supported by the fact, is inapplicable to the case.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p20">
<span class="num">20</span>
<p class="indent">The law furnishing no justification for a departure from the plain and obvious import of the words, the court must, in conformity with that import, declare that a justice of the peace, within the district of Columbia, is exempt from the performance of militia duty.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p21">
<span class="num">21</span>
<p class="indent">It follows, from this opinion, that a court martial has no jurisdiction over a justice of the peace, as a militiaman; he could never be legally enrolled: and it is a principle, that a decision of such a tribunal, in a case clearly without its jurisdiction, cannot protect the officer who executes it. The court and the officer are all trespassers.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p22">
<span class="num">22</span>
<p class="indent">The judgment is reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings.</p>

<h2>
<span class="star-pagination">*349</span> February 22.</h2>
<p>MARSHALL, Ch. J. delivered the opinion of the court.</p>
<p>This action is brought to recover money, received by the defendants, for a ship sold by them as the assignees of Aquila Brown, a bankrupt: which ship is considered, in this cause, as having been liable to forfeiture, under the "Act for registering and recording ships or vessels." It is founded on the idea that, at the time of sale, the ship was the property of the United States, in virtue of the act of forfeiture which had been committed, and of the proceedings of the United States in consequence of that act.</p>
<p>It appears that in 1801, Aquila Brown, jun. then carrying on trade in his own name, in Baltimore, obtained a register for the Anthony Mangin, as his sole property; having first taken the oath which the law requires, to enable him to obtain such register. He afterwards became a bankrupt, and the Anthony Mangin passed, with his other effects, to his assignees, who sold her for the money now claimed by the United States. After <span class="star-pagination">*350</span> this sale, facts were discovered, inducing the opinion that a certain Harman Henry Hackman, a foreigner, was part owner of the vessel, a circumstance within the knowledge of Aquila Brown; and upon this ground she was seized and libelled in the court of admiralty. By the sentence of that court, the libel was adjudged not to be supported, and was dismissed. It is agreed, and is so stated in the reasoning of the judge, which accompanied his opinion, that this sentence was not intended to decide the question of forfeiture; but was founded on the alienation of the vessel before the forfeiture was claimed. Acquiescing in this decision, the United States brought the present action. At the trial, the judge instructed the jury that this action was not maintainable, although they should be of opinion that the fact alleged in the oath, which was taken to obtain the register, was untrue within the knowledge of the person taking the oath. To this instruction an exception was taken; and upon that, among other points, the cause comes into this court.</p>
<p>The words of the act under which the right of the United States accrues are: "And in case any of the matters of fact in the said oath or affirmation alleged, which shall be within the knowledge of the party so swearing, or affirming, shall not be true, there shall be a forfeiture of the ship or vessel, together with her tackle, furniture, and apparel, in respect to which the same shall have been made, or of the value thereof, to be recovered with costs of suit, of the person by whom such oath or affirmation shall have been made."</p>
<p>The question made at the bar is, whether, by virtue of this act, the absolute property in the ship or vessel, vests in the United States, either in fact or in contemplation of law, on the taking of the false oath; or remains in the owners until the United States shall perform some act, manifesting their election to take the ship and not the value.</p>
<p>So far as respects this question, the effect of the sentence in the court of admiralty is put out of the case, for the court has not decided what the effect of that sentence will be.</p>
<p>It has been proved, that in all forfeitures accruing at common law, nothing vests in the government until <span class="star-pagination">*351</span> some legal step shall be taken for the assertion of its right, after which, for many purposes, the doctrine of relation carries back the title to the commission of the offence; but the distinction, taken by the counsel for the United States, between forfeitures at common law, and those accruing under a statute, is certainly a sound one. Where a forfeiture is given by a statute, the rules of the common law may be dispensed with, and the thing forfeited may either vest immediately, or on the performance of some particular act, shall be the will of the legislature. This must depend upon the construction of the statute.</p>
<p>The cases cited from 5th Mod. and 5th Durnford &amp; East, are certainly strong cases. Whether they can be reconciled to the general principles of English law, need not be considered, because the present inquiry respects the construction of an act of Congress, containing words which vary essentially from those used in the acts of the British parliament, on which those decisions were made.</p>
<p>The question, therefore, does the ship vest absolutely in the United States, so as to make it their property, whether such be the choice of the government or not, or may they elect to reject the ship and proceed for its value, must be decided by the particular words of the act.</p>
<p>The words taken according to their natural import, certainly indicate that an alternative is presented to the United States. "There shall be a forfeiture of the ship, or of the value thereof, to be recovered with costs of suit, of the person by whom such oath shall have been made."</p>
<p>Had a special action on the case been brought against the person, by whom the oath was made, stating circumstances on which a forfeiture would arise, and averring an election on the part of the United States, to claim the value, it would be a very bold use of the power of construction which is placed in a court of justice, to say, that such an action could not be maintained, because the vessel itself was vested in the government, and the value was only given in the event of the vessel being withdrawn from its grasp.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*352</span> In addition to the obvious and natural import of the words used by the legislature, the opinion, that an alternative is given to the government, derives some strength from the consideration, that the forfeitures are claimed from distinct persons. If the ship be forfeited she is claimed from all the owners. In an action for the Anthony Mangin, Harman Henry Hackman could not have defended himself by averring his interest in the vessel, and that only the share of Brown was forfeited; but in an action against Hackman, for the value, the declaration, or information, must have averred that he was the person who took the false oath, and proof that it was taken by his partner would not have supported that averment. They are, then, distinct forfeitures, claimed from different persons. The ship, from the owners; the value from the particular owner who has taken the false oath.</p>
<p>The United States are entitled to both, or to only one of them. A right to both has not, and certainly cannot, be asserted. If there be a right only to one, the government may elect to take either; but till the election be made, the title to the one is perfectly equal to the title to the other.</p>
<p>It seems to be of the very nature of a right to elect one of two things, that actual ownership is not acquired in either, until it be elected; and if the penalty of an offence, be not the positive forfeiture of a particular thing, but one of two things, at the choice of the person claiming the forfeiture, it would seem to be altering, materially, the situation in which that person is placed, to say, that either is vested in him before he makes that choice. If both are vested in him, it is not an election which to take, but which to reject; it is not a forfeiture of one of two things, but a forfeiture of two things, of which one only can be retained.</p>
<p>That the legislature may pass such an act, is certain; but that the one under consideration, is such an act, is not admitted by the court.</p>
<p>If the property in the vessel was actually vested in the United States by the commission of the offence, then the judgment of a court, condemning the vessel, <span class="star-pagination">*353</span> or declaring it to belong to the government, would, in fact, do nothing more than ascertain that the offence had been committed; it would not vest the thing more completely in the government, in point of right, than it was vested by the commission of the offence. If, notwithstanding the complete ownership of the vessel, which the argument supposes in the government immediately upon the act of forfeiture, and in virtue of that act, a suit for the value might have been maintained, it would seem to follow that a judgment declaring the vessel to be the property of the United States, would not bar an action for the value, provided the benefit of that judgment had not been received by the United States. Â— The real principle on which an action for the value can be maintained would seem to be that the ship itself did not belong to the United States in consequence of the false oath, but in consequence of the election to take the ship. If this election be not made, and the government shall elect the value, then the property of the vessel remains in the original owners, and is no obstacle to a suit for the value. But if this opinion be mistaken; if the property in the ship be immediately invested in the government, notwithstanding which the value may be claimed, the court cannot distinctly perceive why the same action might not be maintained, notwithstanding the declaration of a court that the property was in the United States, provided the benefit of their judgment was not obtained. In this view of the case, if the court of admiralty had decreed in favor of the United States, and the Anthony Mangin had been destroyed before the benefit of that judgment had been received, the person who had taken the false oath, might still have been sued for the value. This would never be contended; and yet if the absolute ownership of the vessel by the United States does not preclude a right to sue for the value before a judgment be rendered, there is some difficulty in discerning when it will preclude that right. In fact, the idea that one of two things is actually vested in government by an act to which forfeiture is attached, seems incompatible with the idea of a right to elect which of two things shall vest.</p>
<p>It seems, then, to be the necessary construction of the act of congress that the United States acquired no <span class="star-pagination">*354</span> property in the Anthony Mangin until they elected to pursue that part of the alternative given by the statute. Of consequence, the money for which that vessel was sold, was not, at the time, received for the use of the United States; but for the use of the creditors of the bankrupt.</p>
<p>To decide finally on the propriety of supporting the claim of the United States, as made in this action, under that branch of the statute which forfeits the vessel, another question still remains to be investigated. Has the doctrine of relation such an influence upon this case, that an election subsequent to the sale shall carry back the title of the United States to the commission of the act of forfeiture, so as by this fiction of law to make them the real owners of the vessel at the time of sale, and consequently of the money for which she was sold?</p>
<p>Without a critical examination of the doctrine of relation, it would seem to be a necessary part of that doctrine, that the title to a thing which is to relate back to some former time, must exist against the thing itself, not against some other thing which the claimant may wish to consider as its substitute. To carry back the title to the Anthony Mangin to the act of forfeiture, the title to the Anthony Mangin must have an actual existence. If no such title exists, then the right to elect the vessel is lost, and the statute has not forfeited the money for which she was sold in lieu of her. Suppose, instead of being sold by the defendants, she had been exchanged by Aquila Brown himself for another ship, would that other ship have been forfeitable by the doctrine of relation in lieu of the Anthony Mangin? Â— Clearly not; for the statute gives no such forfeiture. The forfeiture attaches to the thing itself, not to any article for which the thing may be exchanged.</p>
<p>The court will not inquire whether an action on the case against Grundy &amp; Thornburgh, for money had and received to the use of the United States, be a proper action in which to establish a forfeiture for a fact committed by Aquila Brown. But some objections to it may be stated which deserve consideration. It certainly gives no notice of the nature of the claim, a circumstance <span class="star-pagination">*355</span> with which, in a case like this, the ordinary rules of justice ought not to dispense. It asserts a claim founded on a crime yet remaining to be proved, not against the person who has committed that crime, or against him who possesses the thing which is liable for it, but against those who, though the assignees of the effects, are not the assignees of the torts committed by the bankrupt. It may change the nature of the defence.</p>
<p>The court suggests these difficulties as probably constituting objections to the action, without deciding on them. The points previously determined show that it is not maintainable in this case, under that alternative of the statute which subjects the vessel to forfeiture.</p>
<p>It remains to be inquired whether it can be maintained under the provision which gives a right to sue for the value.</p>
<p>Upon this part of the case no doubt was ever entertained. Not only must the declaration specially set forth the facts on which the right of the United States accrued, and the law which gives their title, but the action must be brought against the person who has committed the offence. Discarding those words which relate to other objects, and reading those only on which the claim to the value is founded, the statute enacts that "in case any of the matters of fact in the said oath alleged which shall be within the knowledge of the party so swearing, shall not be true, there shall be a forfeiture of the value of the vessel, in respect to which the same shall have been made, to be recovered, with costs of suit, of the person by whom such oath shall have been made." It certainly requires no commentary on these words to prove that an action for the value can only be supported against the person who has taken the oath.</p>
<p>It being the opinion of the court that this action is not maintainable under any proof offered by the plaintiffs, it was deemed unnecessary to inquire whether the other exceptions in the record be well or ill founded. Â— <span class="star-pagination">*356</span> Without declaring any opinion respecting them, the judgment of the circuit court is affirmed.</p>
<p>Judgment affirmed.<sup>[*]</sup></p>
<h2>NOTES</h2>
<p>[*]  The opinion of Judge Winchester, in the case of the United States v. the Anthony Mangin, Norman, claimant, referred to in the argument, was as follows:
</p>
<p>The libel is grounded on the statute, for enrolling and registering ships and vessels.</p>
<p>The proceeding being in rem, all the world become parties to the sentence, as far as the right of property is involved; and of course, all persons any wise interested in the property in question, are admissible to claim and defend their interests.</p>
<p>The libel states the cause of action, with all the averments necessary to support the affirmative allegation, that a forfeiture has accrued.</p>
<p>The only claimant intervening in this cause, is T.W. Norman, who alleges himself to be a purchaser bona fide, for a valuable consideration, ignorant of any cause of forfeiture existing at the time of the purchase; and under such purchase, i.e. bona fide, and for valuable consideration, claiming the property as exonerated from the cause of forfeiture alleged, even if the facts stated to sustain the same be true, which he in no wise admits.</p>
<p>On these proceedings, several questions of law have been raised and argued by the counsel; and as the great point in the cause does not appear to have ever received, either in this country or Great Britain, any direct judicial determination, I have, with great diligence, examined into the questions, which, from the breaking the cause, I saw must necessarily be involved in the determination.</p>
<p>The opinion which I am now to give, though the result of more than usual investigation, is delivered with the diffidence which will ever attend the determination of an inferior court, upon a new, great, and important legal question, and which will probably receive, as it ought, the ultimate judgment of the supreme court.</p>
<p>It is necessary to keep in different views, the questions of fact, in issue, the questions of law arising from those facts, and the parties between whom they arise.</p>
<p>It is to be distinctly remembered, that A. Brown, whose wilful perjury is alleged to sustain the forfeiture sued for, is no party to this suit; neither are his assignees, in any shape, parties to this suit, to be directly affected by the judgment. Every consideration, therefore, which would support a prosecution against the actual offender, to recover the penalty of his wilful crime, or which might be alleged against those who stand in his situation, as privies in law quo ad the forfeiture, must be laid out of the case. The only parties to this suit are, the United States and the informant, as libellants, and T.W. Norman, as claimant of the ship.</p>
<p>I think it peculiarly necessary to confine my opinion to the state of facts, and the questions of law applying to the parties in court, because it is not necessary for me to decide, whether the assignees of A. Brown are clothed with any of the essential characters of a fair purchaser, or have, so far as relates to the property, any privilege or exemption which Brown himself would not have had; and the question de bona fide emptoris, does arise directly upon captain Norman's claim, and will determine this case. To that I shall, therefore, immediately proceed.</p>
<p>No seizure was made, or libel filed against the ship, until after Brown's bankruptcy, and a sale by his assignees to the claimant, who is admitted to be an innocent purchaser for a valuable consideration; nor until after he had obtained a new register in his own name, upon that purchase.</p>
<p>It is argued by the libellants' counsel, that Brown was not competent to pass any property to his assignees, nor they to any purchaser under them, as the forfeiture relates back to vest the property from the time of the false oath, and that the claim of the libellants is paramount to that of the claimant.</p>
<p>The defendant's counsel argue in support of his claim, that the relation back to the time of the offence, is never admitted to overreach rights intermediately acquired by third persons.</p>
<p>In commenting upon the case from 1 D. and E. 252, when the argument was first opened, Mr. Martin pressed very strongly the dictum of Lord Kenyon, that if the relation back to the time of an offence was admitted as to the property, it would, in every case, equally relate to the profits intermediately acquired. If the reason assigned was true, it certainly furnished one of the strongest cases for applying the argument ab inconvenienti, and as such I was forcibly struck with it when mentioned.</p>
<p>The manner in which Lord Kenyon is reported to have made this observation plainly shows it to be the declaration of a sudden impression, and which, though correct as applied to some special cases, is not so in the latitude reported, either at common law, the civil law, or in equity supported by policy.</p>
<p>1. At common law, even as to the guilty party, no attainder whatsoever has relation, as to the mesne profits of land, but only from the time of the attainder. 3 Bac. 272. Co. Lit. 290. (b.) 118. (a.)</p>
<p>2. By the civil law, and the rules of equity adopted from that code, a subsequent possessor is not only, not in a worse situation than those from whom he derives his possession, but even in cases where the original possessor might be bound to restore profit, a bona fide possessor is exempt from any such obligation; as in the case of a bona fide purchaser. Bona fide emptor non dubie percipiendo fructus etiam ex re aliena, interim suos faciat, non tantum eos qui diligentia et opera ejus proveniunt, sed omnes; quia quod ad fructus attinet loco domini est. Zouch 2. J.C. 213.</p>
<p>3. It would not be equitable or just in the abstract, to permit a legal owner to lay by, to avail himself of the ignorance of an innocent holder. And the same considerations of policy, which in England permit the offender and his family to enjoy the profits of lands forfeited for treason, which is a strong and acknowledged case of relation to the offence, least the land should be uncultivated, and the public interest thereby suffer, applies conclusively to every case where it may be doubtful whether the relation is to the offence, or only to the time of conviction.</p>
<p>As this reason against relation does not appear to have the force it carried at first view, we must have recourse,</p>
<p>1st. To the principles of decision in analogous cases; in their application, always having regard, (as was justly argued by Mr. Harper, on the motion to produce Brown's examination before the commissioners) "that a relation back shall never be admitted to injure the rights of third persons, nor to protect or favour wrong." And</p>
<p>2d. To the statute under which the forfeiture is claimed in this cause.</p>
<p>The adjudged cases on this subject, are six classes of offences, which incur a forfeiture of real estate; 2 B.C. 267, and seventeen which produce a forfeiture of personal property; 2 B.C. 421. In this numerous classification, the principle which governs each description of cases does not materially differ. I have, therefore, selected only, 1st. The cases of outlawry, and attainder of crimes; and, (as illustrative of these cases)</p>
<p>2d. Waived goods.</p>
<p>3d. Relation of executions at common law, and since the statute of Charles, and,</p>
<p>4th. (As involving the general doctrine of this case, and to explain the case of Roberts v. Withered, cited by Mr. Harper, from 5 Mod. 193. Salk. 223.) A case of villainage which governed that decision.</p>
<p>1. Attainder, or conviction of crimes, and outlawry.</p>
<p>Of this description there are two classes, which are adjudged to have relation to the time of the offence committed, and overreach all intermediate alienations Â— treason and felo de se. The case of treason, in which the forfeiture as to land relates to the time of the offence committed, depends upon feudal principles. As the land could not be aliened by the tenant voluntarily, it would be preposterous to admit that to be done, through the medium of a crime, which could not be done by a lawful act; and the power to sell, introduced by subsequent statutes, is construed as applying only to lawful alienations. The reason assigned in some books, that it shall relate to the offence, "because the indictment contains the year and day when it was done," is by no means true or satisfactory, since that would apply equally to personal property, which, the same books admit, is only affected from the time of the conviction; and the time charged is traversable, even in the case of land, by third persons claiming an interest therein, 5 Bac. 228. H.H.P.C. 261, 262. 3 Bac. 271. Plow. 488. 8 Co. 170. H.H.P.C. 264, 270. 3 Inst. 230.</p>
<p>It is a proposition universally true, that the forfeiture, upon an attainder of treason, relates but to the conviction as to chattels, unless the case of the offender killed in resisting, or flight, form an exception, which may well be doubted. Indeed, says Lord Coke, it hath always been holden, that any one indicted of treason or felony, may, bona fide, sell any of his chattels, real or personal, 3 Bac. 271, Perk. 29. 8 Rep. 171. Skinner, 357, Jones v. Ashhurst. 4 Com. Dig. Forfeiture, B. 4. 2 Inst. 48.</p>
<p>In the case of a felo de se, it is stated, that the forfeiture has relation to the time of the mortal wound given, so that all intermediate alienations are avoided, 3 Bac. 272. This is the only case I have ever discovered, in which the doctrine of relation has been so far extended. If the principle of that determination is bound, and it is applicable to other cases, it is a drag-net indeed. It may, perhaps, most correctly be considered as a case sui generis, and neither for the reasons which are assigned to maintain it, nor the doctrine it supports, applicable to other cases.</p>
<p>Those who are curious on this subject, will be amused with the argument of Chief Justice Dyer, on the drowning of Sir J. Hales, and will, probably, be as much convinced by the reasoning of the Chief Justice, as by the logic of the grave-digger in Hamlet, to prove that the drowning of Ophelia was se defendendo. Plow. 262.</p>
<p>Outlawry subjects the party to forfeitures, which are well known to depend upon the nature of the suit on which they are prosecuted. Without inquiring when an office is necessary, or may be dispensed with by the crown, I shall mention one case, where, even after an outlawry, (of which purchasers might always have notice, as it is a matter of record) a fair purchaser was protected, even against the crown. It is from Hardress, 101, The Attorney-General v. Freeman. A was outlawed, and afterwards made a lease of his lands, and afterwards, these lands, among others, were found by inquisition; and this case was pleaded in bar, to bind the king before the inquisition. The court held that a lease, or other estate made by the party after outlawry, and before an inquisition taken, will prevent the king's title, if it be made bona fide, and upon good consideration; but if it be in trust for the party only, it will not be a bar; but that no conveyance whatsoever, made after the inquisition, will take away or discharge the king's title, 5 Bac. 564. Salk. 395. Carth. 442.</p>
<p>These cases are strong to show the general protection afforded by law to fair purchasers, even where the forfeiture is in rem, and the offender is not actually divested of his possession, the necessity of which is directly affirmed in the second description of cases to which I have referred, viz.</p>
<p>2. Waived goods.</p>
<p>"As to waived goods, these belong to the king, and are in him without any office, for the property is in nobody. They may belong in like manner to the lord of the manor by grant, but not by prescription," 5 Bac. 517. 5 Co. 109.</p>
<p>The general principle of these cases is conformable to that quoted by Mr. Harper from 12 Mod. 92, to show, that an offence like that charged against Brown, divested the property out of him, and left it, as it were, in abeyance until suit, which vested the property by relation from the act of forfeiture.</p>
<p>A position of greater comprehension, or which, as a general one, should embrace the libellants' case, could scarcely be imagined. Waived goods are in the king without office; that is, even without seizure, the purpose of which, as to legal title to the king, is answered by the office; the property is, as it were, in abeyance; yet this case, so completely applicable in its general principles, contains the strongest possible illustration of the doctrine, that a title by forfeiture, in the case of a personal chattel, begins from suit, seizure, or conviction; and has no relation back; for "the owner may at any time retake the goods waived, if they are not seized by the king, or the lord of the manor; for the lord's property begins from the seizure," 5 Bac. 517. Kitchen, 82.</p>
<p>This case is conclusive against Mr. Hollingsworth's argument, that this question is a question of property only, since it proves that property only begins from the seizure, which cannot be lawfully made to affect an intermediately vested right of a third person.</p>
<p>3. The relation of executions at common law, and since the statute Â— considering this case as one between the government and the claimant, from analogy to cases of the King's precedency in execution.</p>
<p>By the statute of 33 H. 8, c. 9. it is enacted, that if any suit be commenced or taken Â— or any process awarded for the recovery of any of the King's debts, then the same suit, or process, shall be preferred before any person or persons.</p>
<p>And as to the King's execution of goods, the same relates to the time of awarding thereof, which is the teste of the writ; as it was in the case of a common person at common law. 2. Bac. 734.</p>
<p>Now to apply this doctrine to the case before the court, and even admitting to this libel the same extent of relation as is admitted at common law upon the King's execution against personal chattels, and as to real and personal by the above recited statute, will it overreach the sale to Captain Norman?</p>
<p>It is generally agreed that an execution, executed though posterior to the time to which the King's extent relates, bars the King's priority Â— and in the case of Lechmere v. Thorowgood, 3 Mod. 236. Comb. 123, it was holden that if the King's extent be sued out posterior to a judgment recovered by the subject, and writ of execution thereon delivered to the sheriff, though not executed, the King shall be postponed Â— for the property of the goods is changed by the subject's execution.</p>
<p>Here then we advance one step farther in restricting the doctrine of relation, as it applies to individual interests. It is presumed that the principles of relation upon executions since the statute, are too familiar to require any reference to adjudged cases.</p>
<p>The case of Roberts &amp; Withered, as reported by Salkeld, and copied by Bacon, is in these words: "By the act of navigation, 12 Car. 2, cap. 18, certain goods are prohibited to be imported here, under pain of forfeiting them, one part to the King, another to him or them that will inform, seize, or sue for the same." It was adjudged that in this case the subject may bring detinue for such goods; as the lord may have replevin for the goods of his villain distrained; for the bringing of the action vests a property in the plaintiff. When this case was first referred to by Mr. Harper, I considered, as I believe he and the other counsel did, that it came nearer to the case before the court, than any which occurred in their researches. On a careful examination of that case, I now think it will be found, not to bear on the point now to be decided.</p>
<p>In the first case it may be observed, that the case as reported does not afford any ground to presume that any other person than he who unlawfully imported the goods was interested in that suit; but on the contrary it is presumable that it was a suit against the original importer. In that case, the question of relation could not have arisen, since it was utterly unimportant to the plaintiff and to the defendant, whether the plaintiff recovered by a title which related to his writ, or to the time of the importation. And further it is to be remarked, that the question in that case seems to have been only upon the form of action. It was detinue which is founded on property; and all that that case decides is, that in a case of specific forfeiture, the bringing of a suit vests a property in the plaintiff sufficient to sustain that form of action; for the case to which it is likened, and on which the decision rests, is express to show it does not relate to the interests of others; for says the book, "in this case the subject may bring detinue for such goods Â— as the lord may have replevin for the goods of his villain," which case, as I will show, goes not only to the form of action, but to the full length of this case. I will read that case. [Vide Littleton, section 177, with Lord Coke's comment thereon.] So in this case the ship was liable to forfeiture and might have been specifically recovered from Brown by the government, or any prosecutor under its laws, before a bona fide alienation by him; but if they have waited until such alienation by him; and a third person has honestly bought and paid for the property, they may be answered in the language of Littleton, "that it shall be adjudged their folly that they did not enter when the offender was in possession;" for according to Lord Coke, before such seizure they had neither jus in re, nor jus ad rem, but only a right to sue, which I understood to be Lord Coke's possibility above referred to. From all these cases and principles I infer that the relation of the forfeiture to the time of the offence, in cases of treason and felony, especially by self-murder, is peculiar to those cases; that in cases of forfeiture of chattels, the relation is only to the time of conviction Â— that the forfeiture to which a party is subjected, by statute, of a personal chattel, must be construed with relation to the continuance of his ownership in that chattel at the time of conviction; and cannot be prosecuted in rem to affect a bona fide purchaser for a valuable consideration; and this construction I think not only warranted by the statute on which this suit is founded, and which speaks of a recovery of the value of the ship, but also by sound legal principles. The value can only be recovered against the actual offender, and never from a bona fide holder; for against the offender it is the value at the time of the offence; even against a mala fide holder it is only of the thing, be the value of that thing greater or less. If any holder bona fide was liable because of his possession, he would not be the less so after he had parted with his possession; but he might be made answerable for the value of the thing in the same manner as if the possession continue with him; but even where he was not strictly a bona fide holder, the remedy is lost if his possession is gone. And it is but just, when two remedies are given to punish an offence, one of which shows a plain intent of the legislature, that it shall follow the offender personally, or in his personal interests, so to construe the other remedies as not to permit them to be extended to involve others who are wholly innocent, in the same degree of punishment as would attach to the responsible offender.</p>
<p>The argument, that Brown, by his false-swearing, subjected the ship to forfeiture de facto, and that no alienation by him could vest a better title in the vendee than the vendor possessed; and that as he held the ship subject to forfeiture, so any holder under him, or through him, must take subject to that forfeiture, is certainly a strong one.</p>
<p>The general principle is undoubtedly true, that a derivative title cannot be better than the original from which it is derived; but it is only true as a general principle; and the exceptions to its operation are those on which I rely to warrant my construction of the statute in providing for a recovery of the value of the ship, as well as to show that in some instances he who has no title at all may yet transfer a valid one to personal chattels.</p>
<p>Robbery can give no title to goods, and upon conviction, there is a judgment of restitution, according to the statute, which fixes the remedy against any person in possession at the time of the conviction; and this is by the express provision of positive law. Yet the owner of goods stolen, who has prosecuted the thief to conviction, cannot recover the value of his goods from a person who has purchased and sold them again, even with notice of the theft, before conviction. And if the owner of goods loses them by a fraud, and not a felony, and afterwards convicts the offender, he is not entitled to restitution, or to retain them against a person Â— e.g. a pawn-broker, who has fairly acquired a new right of property in them.</p>
<p>If, therefore, he who hath no title at all, may in some cases, nevertheless, give a legal right, a fortiori he who holds by a title defeasible only within a limited time, (for by the statute of limitation, the prosecution, in cases like the present, must be within three years) may transfer a good title to a fair purchaser for a valuable consideration.</p>
<p>The language of Blackstone is very emphatic: "the right of proprietors of personal chattels is preserved from being divested, only so far as is consistent with that other necessary policy, that purchasers bona fide, in a fair, open, and regular manner, should not be, afterwards, put to difficulties by reason of the previous knavery of the seller."</p>
<p>The statute provides, that in case of a wilful false oath in any of the matters required, previous to the obtaining of the registry, "there shall be a forfeiture of the ship or vessel, together with her tackle, apparel and furniture, in respect to which, the same shall have been made, or the value thereof to be recovered," &amp;c.</p>
<p>It seems to me, to be the plain and just construction of this statute, that the wilful false swearing does not ex directo produce a forfeiture of the ship. The forfeiture is alternative, either of the ship, or the value of the ship, at the election of the government or persons suing; but not of both the ship and the value.</p>
<p>If the government had recovered the value from Brown, there would have been an end of proceeding against the ship. And if the offence charged against Brown, only produces a specific forfeiture by a subsequent election, the argument is cogent, that the relation consequent upon that election, should be restricted by the general rule, that it shall not overreach an antecedent equity; and conclusive, that Brown's title was not forfeited de facto, but forfeitable only, and, therefore, within the principles of the cases of villainage, and waived goods, before relied on by me, and expressly by Blackstone, 2 Com. 421.</p>
<p>Further, the forfeiture is of the ship or the value. I have construed this clause somewhat differently from all the counsel, and though this circumstance produces doubts of its correctness, yet as it has weight with me, and minds of less comprehension may sometimes embrace truths, which may escape superior understandings, I think it my duty to mention it. It is this. That the ship is not liable to forfeiture in the hands of any holder, other than the persons false-swearing, in any case but where such holder would be liable to a suit for the value.</p>
<p>The words, that there shall be a forfeiture of the ship, &amp;c. or of the value thereof, to be recovered, with the costs of suit, of the person by whom such oath or affirmation shall have been made, plainly show the intent of the legislature, that the penalty and punishment should attach to the offender only. "To be recovered of the person," both grammatically and legally relate to the object to be recovered, to wit, the ship, or the value thereof; and to the person from whom, and from whom only, the one or the other is to be recovered.</p>
<p>The guilt of false-swearing forfeits only such interests as the offender possessed; for by the express provision of the 16th section of this statute, the rights of an innocent and unoffending owner are exempt from forfeiture; and the words of the statute which connect the recovery with the forfeiture in this case, exclude the idea of any recovery from an innocent holder. Expressio unius est exclusio alterius.</p>
<p>If the ship is forfeited by the sole act of the false-swearing, then she is equally forfeited, notwithstanding there may have been fifty fair transfers in public market. Every particular sale would be a particular conversion, and every one through whose hands she may have passed, might be sued for the value of the price; but the statute says, that the value shall only be recovered of the offender himself. A party having fairly obtained and fairly lost, or departed with his possession, would not, in such case, be liable for the thing or its value. 3 Com. Dig. 359. 2 T.R. 750. If not liable when his possession has honestly ceased, neither can he be made so when it honestly continues, since his own act cannot vary his responsibility.</p>
<p>Does reason or policy require a different construction?</p>
<p>The government prohibits an act under a penalty against the party offending. They say, We, for this, forfeit the thing in respect to which you have sworn falsely, if it continues in existence, and is yours; but if lost, or destroyed, or other persons innocently acquire new rights in that thing, your guilt shall still be punished; if annihilated, if sold, pay the value; if you have fraudulently impaired the thing, pay the value. The one or the other shall be recovered of you, of you the guilty party. But this prohibition contains no threat of punishment against an innocent holder.</p>
<p>No inconvenience arises from this construction. A purchaser can only look to the face of the documents, to the records of title which the law requires for this species of property. The knowledge of the cause of forfeiture rests generally in the bosom of the offender; and the law can never require of a purchaser to examine into the secrets of the heart.</p>
<p>It is more the interest and policy of government to increase its wealth and strength by the employment of its ships in trade and commerce, than to augment its revenues by forfeitures. It therefore wisely protects the interests of fair ship-holders from forfeiture for the crimes of others, while it carefully provides for the punishment of fraudulent contraventions of its laws. Protection is not, by this construction, afforded to guilt or fraud; it is only a shield for innocence.</p>
<p>The remedy remains, as it ought, against him who committed the offence. Government cannot be deprived of its forfeiture by any fraudulent alienation. Such a sale would be void. Skinner, 357, Jones v. Ashhurst. 3 Co. Twine's case. 2 Bl. Com. 421.</p>
<p>The possession is legally, and to effectuate the statutory provision, still in the vendor. Indeed, all the reasoning on this subject is contained in two axioms of the civil law, to which this court may be allowed to refer. In rem actione tenetur qui dolo desiit possidere. Zouch, Elem. 197. Et aliquando, quod fieri non debet, factum valet; firmum et probum quod sit bona fide, improbatur autews quod sit mala fide vel dolo. Zouch, Elem. 41.</p>
<p>If a contrary construction prevails, government may have greater security for a few specific penalties; but it is at the expense of the interests of commerce, and the security of all ship-holders.</p>
<p>I do therefore order and decree, that the libel in this case filed shall stand dismissed, and that the ship, &amp;c. be restored to the claimant.</p>
<p>But as the case involved questions of great difficulty, upon which eminent counsel have differed in opinion, and judges may differ, and it was proper, in every view of the case, to put those questions in a course of legal adjudication, I shall certify probable cause of seizure, and decree restitution, without costs.</p>

<p></p>
<h2>
<span class="star-pagination">*439</span> February 26.</h2>
<p>MARSHALL, C.J. delivered the opinion of the court.</p>
<p>The court has endeavoured to bestow on this cause, the attention to which it is alike entitled, by its own importance, by the situation of one of the parties, who is a stranger to our language and our laws, and by the ability and zeal with which it has been argued at the bar.</p>
<p>The action claims from the defendant, the value of three cargoes of tobacco, purchased by him as the agent of the plaintiffs, which were captured on a voyage to Europe, and condemned as prize. The foundation of the claim is, that he deviated from the instructions which were given for the government of his conduct, and is, therefore, liable for the loss which has been sustained.</p>
<p>That an agent is bound to pursue the orders of his principals, and is answerable for any injury consequent on his departing from them, however fair may have been his motives for such departure, is a plain principle of law which has not been drawn into question; and the only inquiry in this case is, has the defendant obeyed or deviated from his instructions? The circuit court was of opinion that they sanctioned his conduct, and it is the propriety of that opinion which is now to be reviewed in this court.</p>
<p>It depends on the true construction of the letter of the 27th of January, 1798, written by Bernardo Lacosta, on behalf of the plaintiffs, of which Juan Alonzo Menendez Conde was the bearer, and on the testimony which is stated in the bills of exceptions.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*440</span> This letter introduces Menendez as the agent of the plaintiffs, who were principally concerned in the importation of tobacco into Spain, and declares a confidence that the defendant will embrace the business as his own, and execute it with his wonted attention.</p>
<p>After some general observations which relate to the proposed transaction, and which seem to be founded on the idea that the defendant and Menendez are to be associated in the business, the letter becomes more definite. The writer says, "with this the said Mr. Menendez takes an order for 20,000 quintals (of tobacco) to be shipped for this place in seven or eight vessels, and in not less than six, under which condition the insurance will be made here. You will take care to seek captains of fidelity, American born, and that all the crews conform to the most rigorous ordinances. For greater clearness the shipments (las expediciones) will be made according to the following formalities: 1st. You will lade the vessels in your own name, stating that they are on your own account and risk as an American citizen, and consign them," &amp;c.</p>
<p>This instruction is followed by ten others, which seem principally designed to conceal the real character of the cargoes, and to facilitate their escape from cruisers.</p>
<p>At the close of these instructions, the following words are added: "I refer you to that which the bearer will communicate to you verbally, respecting this business, who is sent on purpose to superintend the shipment (va solo para presenciar la expedicion) and you will, upon the whole, act for the advantage of the interested, taking care to keep this business a secret, in order to prevent a rise in your market, and its being known that it is for foreigners, but always that it is on your own account as an American citizen."</p>
<p>In the execution of this commission, the defendant shipped two cargoes, the one on board a Danish and the other on board a Moorish vessel, each of which was captured and condemned as prize, the one by the French, and the other by the English.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*441</span> These shipments were made with the full approbation of Menendez, and it is in proof that American vessels were not, at the time, to be procured.</p>
<p>Before the order was completed, the government of the United States, adopted such measures, for repelling the hostile aggressions of France, as to justify an opinion, that open and declared war between the two nations, would soon take place. Under the impression of these measures, Mr. Menendez considered the American name as no longer affording a neutral character to the cargo, and directed it to be shipped on account and risk of Charles Longhy, of Genoa, who was a correspondent of the plaintiffs. These instructions were complied with.</p>
<p>The tobacco so shipped, which came safe, was received without complaint; but a large quantity, shipped in the Henrietta, was captured by a British cruiser, carried into Halifax, and there condemned as prize.</p>
<p>For the price of these three cargoes this action is brought. The inquiry respecting the two first, will rest, both on the instructions given to the defendant, and on the power of Menendez: that respecting the last, rests solely on the power of Menendez.</p>
<p>It is alleged, that the orders under which the defendant acted, enjoined him to employ only American vessels and that in employing those of other neutral powers, he violated these orders. But there is certainly not one syllable in the letter, which contains any instruction to the defendant, relative to the employment of vessels, or which confines the transportation of the tobacco to be purchased, to American vessels. The court thinks it a fair construction of the letter, that full powers, in this respect, were confided to Menendez, and that Barry might counsel with him, but was to comply with his directions. Menendez is declared to be the agent of the plaintiffs, and the full extent of this term is not limited in any part of the letter. He brings with him an order for 20,000 quintals, to be shipped in six, seven, or eight vessels, under which condition the insurance is to be made in Spain.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*442</span> These are not instructions to Barry; they are communications to him of the instructions given to Menendez, so far as was necessary for his understanding the views of the plaintiffs, and facilitating those views, under the authority of Menendez. The order, of which Menendez was the bearer, was for himself, and the degree of aid expected from Barry, is described in the letter. Barry might have been unable, or unwilling to undertake the business. In any event of that kind, the enterprise was not, certainly, at an end; but Menendez might obtain other assistance. From the nature of the case, therefore, as well as from the expression of the letter, the order was in the possession and power of Menendez, the agent, to whom directions relative to the shipment of the tobacco, in a certain number of vessels, had been given, and who is declared to have been sent to America, for the purpose of superintending those shipments. Having made this explanation of the business confided to Menendez, the letter adds, "you will take care to seek captains of fidelity, American born," &amp;c. Those inquiries, Barry, an American merchant, could make, much more successfully, than Menendez, a foreigner, and, therefore, was directed to make them. But respecting the character of the vessel to be employed, no agency, on the part of Barry, was necessary, further than to comply with such directions as he might receive, and no directions respecting the vessels to be employed, were given him, because those directions were given to Menendez. The instructions to Barry, to seek for American captains, are founded not upon instructions to employ American vessels, which were given to him, for none such were given, but upon the instructions which were given to Menendez. They are founded on the idea, that American vessels would be employed; but as circumstances might render the employment of them ineligible, it was reasonable to suppose that some discretion would be allowed to Menendez in this respect; accordingly, the private instructions, as stated in the bill of exceptions, only directed him to employ neutral vessels.</p>
<p>The idea that the power on this subject was completely in Menendez, and not in Barry, is confirmed, by observing that in the extended and minute rules, which are, for greater clearness, laid down for his government respecting the transportation of the tobacco, not one syllable <span class="star-pagination">*443</span> is said concerning the character of the vessels in which it was to be shipped, a direction which would certainly not have been omitted, had the subject not been confided to the general agent. It is also apparent, from the letters in the bill of exceptions, that the subject was so understood by both Menendez and Barry. When to these circumstances it is added, that American vessels were sought for at the time, and could not be obtained, it seems to the court perfectly clear, that with respect to the tobacco shipped in the Moorish and Danish vessels, the conduct of the defendant being sanctioned by Menendez, was free from all exception.</p>
<p>The claim for the cargo of the Henrietta, stands on stronger ground, because the defendant was explicitly instructed to lade the vessels in his own name, stating that the cargoes were shipped on his own account and risk. On this part of the case, the defendant must seek for a justification in the full powers of Menendez, to vary the orders given to him. These orders have been said to be free from all obscurity, and in themselves they unquestionably are so. Barry could not have doubted the positiveness of his instructions, to ship the tobacco as his own property. The defence he sets up is, that he was justified in conforming to the directions of Menendez, varying those instructions.</p>
<p>An examination of this defence, leads to a still more critical investigation of the letter of the 27th of January.</p>
<p>It has been already observed, that Menendez is stated in the letter, introducing him o Barry, to be the agent of the plaintiffs, and the bearer of their orders for the tobacco, which was to be purchased. As it was not unreasonable to expect that a person, crossing the Atlantic in this character, would have some discretionary power to change instructions with a change in circumstances, so as to be enabled to adapt his conduct to those circumstances, ready faith would be given to all expressions which would convey this idea; and if no such power was intended, no expressions ought to have been used, which could excite and cherish the idea.</p>
<p>The rules stated to Mr. Barry, as those by which his conduct would be governed, are declared to relate to the <span class="star-pagination">*444</span> part he was expected to take in the "expedicion," which the court translate transportation, or conveyance of the tobacco to Europe. One of these being, that the tobacco was to be shipped in his own name, it follows that this part of the subject was included in the Spanish term "expedicion." All these rules conclude with a reference to verbal communications, to be made by the agent himself, who is expressly declared to go to the United States for the sole purpose of attending to this very part of the transaction, "va solo para presenciar la expedicion." This reference to the verbal communications of Menendez, unqualified by any restriction whatever, is a declaration of complete confidence, placed at least in his veracity, by the plaintiffs, and is a full authority given by them to Barry, to credit the representations which he should make. How else is it to be understood? What right could Barry have to say to those who had referred him to the verbal communications which their agent should make to him on a particular subject, that he did not believe those communications?</p>
<p>It is argued, that although no limitation is expressed to the credit which Barry was to give to the representations of Menendez, yet it must be necessarily understood, that he could not change those things which were expressly directed; that the verbal communications referred to, were to be conformable to, not subversive of, the written instructions; that on the idea of a power to alter the written instructions, it was useless to give them, and was only necessary to send out Menendez with a full authority to govern the whole transaction.</p>
<p>But in the course of human affairs, it is not unusual for a principal to give, in detail, his ideas of the line of conduct to be observed by his agent, and yet to allow a departure from that line of conduct, under particular circumstances.</p>
<p>It would not have been extraordinary, had these rules, for the conduct of Barry, been followed by a declaration, that in a total change of circumstances, as in the event of America's becoming a belligerent, he was to ship the tobacco, not as American, but as neutral property. Had Barry been the sole agent, this right to exercise his discretion, if intended to be placed in him, would have <span class="star-pagination">*445</span> been mentioned in his letter. But Barry was neither the sole nor the principal agent. He was known to the plaintiffs only by recommendation, and while he was employed, because an American merchant could make the proposed purchases to greater advantage, and because an American name was required to cover the property. Menendez was the confidential agent, known to and trusted by the plaintiffs, who brought with him the order for the purchases, and came on purpose to attend to the conveyance of the tobacco to Europe. In the instructions to Menendez, therefore, would any discretion relative to the transportation of the tobacco be found, and it was enough that Barry was referred to his verbal communications.</p>
<p>The words which follow the reference to the verbal communications of Menendez, though not those which decide the opinion of the court, are not absolutely unimportant: they are, "and you will, upon the whole, act for the advantage of the parties interested." To what do these words, "upon the whole," refer? Unquestionably to the verbal communications as well as to the written instructions. They were both to regulate the conduct of the defendant. The caution which follows these words, is understood by the counsel for the plaintiffs, to limit their extent, and to direct, that in acting for the advantage of the interested, he was yet to keep secret, that the tobacco belonged to foreigners.</p>
<p>There is, unquestionably great force in this observations and if the justification of Barry rested solely on the power given him in this clause, to act for the best, it would be doubtful how far it would avail him. The court, however, considers those words principally applying to the purchases, and as indicative of an expectation that a state of things would remain, in which the tobacco was to retain the character of American property, rather than as limiting the powers of Menendez over this part of the subject, in the event of such a revolution as would make America a belligerent. The court forbears to make a critical examination of the words, because its opinion is formed on the character in which Menendez came to America, as stated in the letter introducing him to Barry. That letter warranted the belief that he was the principal <span class="star-pagination">*446</span> and confidential agent of the plaintiffs; that he had particular instructions for the government of his conduct, and that Barry was to receive and trust his verbal communications, especially on the subject of expediting the tobacco to Spain. It is impossible to read the letters from Menendez to Barry, which form a part of the bill of exceptions, without feeling a conviction that this was the understanding of the parties. He approves the conduct of the defendant, in the stile of a man whose approbation gave a sanction to it, and when he directs the shipments to be made in the name of Charles Longhy, of Genoa, he says, "if you act conformably to what I have here mentioned, as to further shipments, I, from this moment, approve thereof, and that it may appear, and to save you from any accident that may occur, as also, that such has been with my knowledge and approbation, you are to keep this letter in your possession, in order, that at no time whatever, you should be chargeable with the consequences." Such was the opinion which the confidential agent of the plaintiffs, in possession of their private instructions, entertained of his own powers.</p>
<p>He was not mistaken in their extent; at least, the defendant had no right to believe him mistaken. On his arrival, he declared to Barry, that he was in possession of private instructions, distinct from those which were contained in the letter of the 27th of January. He produced those instructions. The chief clerk of Barry read so much of them as related to vessels, and they did not require that the shipments should be made in American, but in neutral vessels; and in the letter of Menendez to the chief clerk, dated on the 14th June, and accompanying that of the same date, addressed to the defendant, directing him to ship the tobacco as the property of Charles Longhy, of Genoa, he says, referring to a copy of his private instructions, "you will see that I am expressly ordered to make the shipments in neutral vessels, and that the property shall appear as that of a neutral subject." What right had he to suspect that the confidential agent of the plaintiffs, to whose verbal communications they referred him, had forged instructions which he produced as those of his principals?</p>
<p>The counsel for the plaintiffs, question the existence of these private instructions, and demand their production. <span class="star-pagination">*447</span> But how were they to be authenticated? Only by Menendez himself. Are not then their contents to be proved by the declarations of Menendez, by his stating them, and by the chief clerk of Barry, who read a part of them?</p>
<p>To the court, it appears, that in such a case as this, the proof respecting them is as ample and satisfactory as ought to be required.</p>
<p>After taking this extensive view of the case, of the powers of Menendez, and of the confidence the defendant was bound to repose in him, it only remains briefly to observe, that the directions he gave were not such as to awaken suspicion.</p>
<p>On the 14th June, 1798, when these instructions were given, America had ceased to be a neutral power. War, it is true, was not formally declared, but it had commenced in fact, and hostilities were authorised by that department of the government which is invested with the power of making war. In such a state of things, the course which prudence would have dictated to the plaintiffs, had they been themselves in the United States, certainly was to cover the tobacco as neutral, not as American property, and when their agent, possessing private instructions, directed the property to be shipped as neutral, not as American, the defendant would have been culpable in thwarting him.</p>
<p>It is scarcely necessary to add, that Menendez stated himself to be, and probably was, something more than an agent. He declared himself to be interested in the cargoes. This declaration, under all the circumstances of the case, was not to be discredited. Upon that, however, the judgment of the court is not founded. The letter of the 27th January, represented him as the principal and confidential agent of the plaintiffs, whose verbal communications were to be trusted. He declared himself to possess particular instructions respecting a transaction which he came to superintend, and under those instructions he gave orders which the defendant has obeyed. The court is of opinion, that in so doing, the defendant is justifiable, and no error has been committed in the court below, in so instructing the jury.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*448</span> Upon the other part of the exceptions, the price given for the tobacco, it is unnecessary to say more, than that there is no error in the opinion of the court.</p>

<center></center>
<p>Breckinridge, attorney general, in behalf of the United States.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*407</span> JOHNSON, J.</p>
<p>This is an amicable suit, instituted to try the question, whether the defendant, lately collector of the port of Petersburgh, was, after the 30th day of June, 1800, entitled to retain three per centum on the amount of sums received by him after that time, upon bonds for duties taken between that period and the last day of March, 1799.</p>
<p>The claim of the defendant is founded upon the act of March 2d, 1799, "to establish the compensations of the officers employed in the collection of the duties," &amp;c. And the opposition, on behalf of the government, is founded on the act of May 10th, 1800, supplementary to the one before mentioned.</p>
<p>The whole difficulty results from the vague signification of some of the expressions made use of in the latter act; which, so far as may be material to the present decision, are contained in the following extract from the 2d section: "That in lieu of the commissions heretofore allowed by law, there shall, from and after the 30th day of June next, be allowed to the collectors for the districts of Alexandria, Petersburgh and Richmond, respectively, two and a half per centum on all monies which shall be collected and received by them," "for and on account of the duties arising on goods, wares and merchandise, imported into the United States, and on the tonnage of ships and vessels."</p>
<p>On behalf of the United States it is contended, that the rights of the collectors of duties, with regard to their compensation, are absolutely submitted to the will of congress; that congress has uniformly increased or diminished that compensation, as circumstances suggested the expediency of such a measure, without regarding any supposed limitation of their right to do <span class="star-pagination">*408</span> so, imposed by the claims of their officers; that it has been the uniform policy of the government to apportion the commission to the actual receipt of money; and, therefore, whatever may have been the proportion of their labour or responsibility, their right to compensation was not consummated before the actual receipt of the duties, and the amount of their commission remained liable to be increased or diminished at the will of congress; that in passing their act of May 10th, 1800, they had a right to give it a retroactive operation; and the latter words of the 2d section, "arising on goods imported," will bear, and ought to receive such a construction.</p>
<p>At the same time that I admit the correctness of the prefatory observations of the attorney-general, my mind is led to adopt a conclusion unfavorable to the construction which he contends for.</p>
<p>The rights of the collectors of duties, as to their compensation, are certainly submitted to the justice and honour of the country that employs them, until consummated by the actual receipt of the sums bonded in their respective offices; but where an individual has performed certain services, under the influence of a prospect of a certain emolument, that confidence which it is the interest of every government to cherish in the minds of her citizens, a confidence which experience leaves no room to distrust in our own, would lead to a conclusion, that it could not have been the intention of the legislature to defeat a reasonable expectation of her officer, suggested by her own laws. Unless, therefore, the words are too imperious to admit of a different construction, it will be gratifying to the court to be able to vindicate the justice of the government, by restricting the words of the law to a future operation.</p>
<p>That it is the policy of the United States in granting compensations to her revenue officers, to limit the consummation of their right to the actual receipts of money, is evident from a view of all her acts on that subject. But it is observable, that every end of that policy is answered in this case, because the claim of the defendant is founded upon the actual receipt of money <span class="star-pagination">*409</span> arising upon bonds taken while the compensation was at three per cent. His claim has no relation to the amount bonded, but to the amount actually received upon the bonds taken prior to the last act.</p>
<p>Upon considering the question, therefore, upon the construction of the act, I confine myself to the single inquiry, how far the government has exercised its power, in reducing the compensation to the defendant, from three to two and a half per cent?</p>
<p>The words of the act, "arising on goods imported," although in themselves very indefinite in point of time, will receive a precise signification in this respect, by supplying the words "heretofore," to give them a past, or "hereafter," to give them a future signification. If it be necessary that the court should make an election between these words, in order to complete the sense, its choice will be immediately determined by recurring to two well known rules of construction, viz. that it ought to be consistent with the suggestions of natural justice, and that the words should be taken most strongly "contra proferentem."</p>
<p>But there are other considerations, which will lead to a conclusion, without supplying any supposed deficiency in the wording of the sentence. There is nothing, either in the terms made use of, or in the professed object of the law, necessarily retrospective; but the general intention of the act, as well as the signification of the word arising, both point to a future operation. Besides which, where it can be shown that a government has once adopted a certain rule of justice for its conduct, it is fair to infer, that in legislating afterwards upon the same subject, it intended to pursue the same rule, unless the contrary shall be clearly expressed; and in the act of March 3d, 1797, which varies the compensation of the revenue officers, in several particulars, that alteration is expressly restricted to take effect only with regard to future importations. I am of opinion, that the defendant shall have judgment.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*410</span> WASHINGTON, J. The point submitted by the circuit court of Virginia to this court is, whether the defendant, as collector, was restricted to a commission of two and a half per cent on any, or all of the monies collected and received by him, after the 30th June, 1800, on account of bonds previously taken for duties arising on goods, &amp;c. imported into the United States.</p>
<p>The solution of this question must depend upon another: does the 2d section of the act of the 10th of May, 1800, extend to duties which arose upon goods imported before, and received after, the 30th of June in that year, or is it to be restricted to duties arising on goods which should be imported after that period?</p>
<p>I am strongly inclined to the opinion, that every part of this section is future, and that a literal construction will render it entirely prospective upon the whole subject. The time at which the substitution of two and a half for three per cent is to take place, as well as that of collection and receipt, are certainly future, and there is, I think, as little doubt that those receipts can only apply to duties which should arise after the same period, the word arising being clearly future in relation to the time specified in the section. The word imported, though past in relation to the duties which were to arise on the goods imported, may, nevertheless, be future in relation to the period when the charge of commissions was to take effect, and I think it ought to be so construed in this case, because the duties arise either immediately upon the importation of the goods, or upon the performance of some acts which, in contemplation of law, are immediately to follow the importation.</p>
<p>This construction is, I think, considerably strengthened by a reference to former laws upon the same subject.</p>
<p>The act of March, 1797, is plain and express upon this point, by fixing the commissions allowed by that law to monies received on goods imported after the last day of that month. The 2d section of the act of March, 1799, was obviously intended to increase the commissions <span class="star-pagination">*411</span> of some collectors, and to vary the relative compensations which had been allowed to the several collectors by the former law; but there is no reason to believe that it was intended to change the objects for which this compensation to the collectors generally was to be allowed. Yet this law does not, in express terms, confine the commissions to duties arising on goods imported after the specified day, as had been done in the preceding act, but is worded, in this respect, precisely like the law immediately under consideration.</p>
<p>It is hardly to be imagined, that over and above the increase of commissions allowed by the last law for services after the 31st of March, to be wholly rendered, the legislature intended to increase the commissions allowed by the act of 1797, for services which had been in part performed before the 31st of March, 1799, without an expectation of such increase, and where nothing remained to be done but to receive the money. Yet this would be the case, if the increase be not restricted to goods imported after the specified day. The change of expression in the latter law, I take to be perfectly accidental; and, in construing one of them by the other, both being in pari materia, I feel myself constrained to read the latter as if it had been expressed thus: "That after the last day of March, 1799, there shall be the following commissions allowed on all monies received by the collectors respectively, on account of duties arising on goods, &amp;c. imported into the United States, after that day," &amp;c.</p>
<p>The 2d section of the act of 1795 was clearly intended to diminish the compensation of some, and to increase that of other collectors, and can, with as little reason as in the former case, be construed to change the objects for which this compensation was allowed. Such a construction would have the effect of raising the compensation of some collectors, and depressing that of others, for services partly performed at the same time, and in some instances, where those which remained to be done, in order to consummate the right to the commissions, were transferred from the collectors to the banks. This would, I think, be unreasonable, <span class="star-pagination">*412</span> and, in the instances of diminished commissions, would be unjust.</p>
<p>That the services performed preparatory to the collection or receipt of the duties, were considered, by the legislature, as equal, at least, to the receiving of the money, is proved by the 4th section of the law of 1799, which provides, that whenever any collector should die, or resign, the commissions to which he would have been entitled on the receipt of all duties by him bonded, shall be equally divided between the collector resigning, or the legal representatives of the deceased collector, and his successor, whose duty it is made to collect the same.</p>
<p>I cannot, therefore, consent to such an interpretation of this law, as to give it a retrospective operation, so as to deprive an officer of a compensation previously allowed by law, for services admitted by the legislature to deserve compensation, and to be in their nature severable, from the ultimate act of the money being received or collected, provided those acts are in reality performed.</p>
<p>My opinion is, that the defendant is entitled to three per cent on all monies collected and received by him, after the 30th June, 1800, on account of bonds previously taken, for duties arising on goods imported into the United States.</p>
<p>PATERSON, J. The basis of this action is, the statute of congress, of the 10th of May, 1800; and the question is, whether the defendant is restricted to a commission of two and a half per cent, on monies collected and received after the 30th of June, 1800, by virtue of revenue bonds, executed previously to that date. The words of the statute are, "that in lieu of the commission, heretofore allowed by law, there shall, from and after the 30th of June next, be allowed to the collectors of Alexandria, Petersburgh, and Richmond, respectively, two and a half per cent, on all monies which shall be collected and received by them, for and on account of the duties arising on goods, wares, and merchandise, imported into the United States, and on the <span class="star-pagination">*413</span> tonnage of ships and vessels." The defendant was late collector of the customs, for the district of Petersburgh, in the state of Virginia. Words in a statute ought not to have a retrospective operation, unless they are so clear, strong, and imperative, that no other meaning can be annexed to them, or unless the intention of the legislature cannot be otherwise satisfied. This rule ought especially to be adhered to, when such a construction will alter the pre-existing situation of parties, or will affect or interfere with their antecedent rights, services, and remuneration; which is so obviously improper, that nothing ought to uphold and vindicate the interpretation, but the unequivocal and inflexible import of the terms, and the manifest intention of the legislature. The word "arising" refers to the present time or time to come, but cannot, with any propriety, relate to time past, and embrace former transactions. As to the word "imported," it may comprehend the past or future, or both, according to the subject matter, and the words with which it is associated. Thus the word "arising," coupled with the words "on goods imported," shows, that the whole clause has a future bearing and aspect, and will not justly admit of a retroactive construction. According to this view of the subject, the commission of two and a half per cent, is to be restricted to monies received by the collector of Petersburgh, on account of the duties arising on goods, wares, and merchandise, which shall be imported after the 30th of June, when the act went into operation. To fortify the foregoing construction, it may be added, that the words of a statute, if dubious, ought, in cases of the present kind, to be taken most strongly against the law makers.</p>
<p>CUSHING, J. The question referred to this court by the circuit court is, whether the defendant, as collector, by the act of the 10th of May, 1800, was restricted to a commission of two and a half per cent, on any or all of the monies collected and received by him, after the 30th June, 1800, on account of bonds previously taken for duties arising on goods, wares, and merchandise, imported into the United States?</p>
<p>There was a prior act of congress entitling the defendant to three per cent, on all monies received on account <span class="star-pagination">*414</span> of duties arising on goods imported into the United States, within his district; which act was in full force during the time those duties arose, and until the subsequent act in question of the 10th of May, 1800, was to come into operation, which was the 30th of June following; and the question is upon bonds previously taken for duties arising on goods imported before the 30th of June. Upon this question I am of opinion, that the collector has a right to the three per cent allowed by the former law, on all monies secured by bonds previously taken as aforesaid, for duties arising on goods imported before the 30th of June, 1800; and that he is not restricted by the latter law to two and a half per cent. And that the general and true intent of the latter law was to make a new allowance in lieu of the former only on duties arising on goods imported after the last law came into operation, and not to have a retrospective effect, to divest vested rights of the collector; it being unreasonable, in my opinion, to give the law a construction, which would have such a retrospective effect, unless it contained express words to that purpose.</p>
<p>Whether the words "from and after the 30th of June," are in the beginning, middle, or end of the sentence, the meaning, in this respect, appears to me the same Â— to give the collector a new allowance on goods imported after that time.</p>
<p>When the former duties were secured by bond, the laws, I think, consider them, as far as regards the collector's allowance, as collected and received; the principal services being already done by securing the duties by bond.</p>
<p>MARSHALL, C.J. being one of the judges whose opinions were opposed in the court below, did not sit at this hearing.</p>

<p class="indent">Upon the trial, the jury found both the issues of fact for the defendant, and the plaintiff took two bills of exceptions.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p9">
<span class="num">9</span>
<p class="indent">1. The first stated, that the defendant offered in evidence, the deposition of Patrick Cavan, tending to prove, that <i>wheat</i>, to the amount of 166<i>l</i>. 8<i>s</i>. 10<i>d</i>. had been delivered by the obligor to the plaintiff, on account of the bond, and sundry debts due to Kirk and Moffett, had been assigned to the plaintiff in full discharge of the bond; and that the plaintiff had indulged some of the debtors until the debts were barred by the statute of limitations. That notice was given to the plaintiff's attorney, that the deposition would be taken on the 8th of August, 1801, and if not taken in one day, that the commissioners would adjourn from <i>day to day</i> until it should be finished, and that he agreed that it might be taken on that day, whether he attended or not; but did not assent or object to its being taken on any other day. That the commissioners, to whom the dedimus was directed, met on the 8th of August, 1801, and adjourned to Monday the 10th, and from the 10th to the 11th, from the 11th to the 12th, and from the 12th to the 19th, when the deposition was taken. That the plaintiff's attorney did not attend on the 8th, or any of the other days, and had no notice of the several adjournments.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p10">
<span class="num">10</span>
<p class="indent">That the defendant also offered to prove by Archibald M'Lain, that the plaintiff's attorney, after the deposition was taken, read it, but did not then object to its being read in evidence; and that the said Patrick Cavan died before the trial. To the reading of this deposition, the plaintiff objected, but the court suffered it to be read.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p11">
<span class="num">11</span>
<p class="indent">2. The 2d bill of exceptions stated, that the plaintiff prayed the court to instruct the jury, that the defendant was not entitled, on the plea of payment, to discount the bonds and notes assigned to the plaintiff, as mentioned in the deposition of Cavan, unless it should appear to the jury that the same had been collected by the plaintiff; which instruction the court refused to give, but directed the jury, that the deposition was competent evidence to be offered in proof of a discount on the plea of payment.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p12">
<span class="num">12</span>
<p class="indent"><i>E. J. Lee</i>, for the plaintiff in error, contended.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p13">
<span class="num">13</span>
<p class="indent">1. That the deposition was irregularly taken, inasmuch as a notice to take a deposition on the 8th, is not notice to take it on the 19th; and although notice was given, that if the deposition was not taken on the 8th, the commissioners would adjourn from <i>day to day</i>, yet in this case, they adjourned over from the 12th to the 19th, without giving new notice. Besides, the notice in this case is to the attorney <i>at law</i>, and not to an attorney <i>in fact</i>. If it be said, that an attorney at law may bind his client, by an agreement relative to any matter in the proceedings, or trial of a cause, yet, the assent of the attorney only went to the taking the deposition on the 8th of August, and not on any subsequent day.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p14">
<span class="num">14</span>
<p class="indent">2. It was not competent for the defendant to prove that assent, by the testimony of Archibald M'Lain, who was his guardian of record, and answerable for costs.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p15">
<span class="num">15</span>
<p class="indent">3. The matter contained in the deposition, was not competent evidence upon either of the issues. It certainly was not evidence of a release under seal; and the assignment would not be a payment, unless it produced the money to the plaintiff. If any thing but money is relied upon as satisfaction of a bond, it must be pleaded by way of accord and satisfaction, and not as payment. One bond cannot be pleaded in discharge of another, <i>a fortiori</i> cannot an <i>assignment</i> of a bond. 1 <i>Burr.</i> 9, <i>Rhodes</i> v. <i>Barnes</i>.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Simms</i>, for the defendant.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p17">
<span class="num">17</span>
<p class="indent">1. If the plaintiff had not notice of the time of taking the deposition, it was his own fault, or that of his attorney. The attorney, having received and acknowledged notice for the 8th of August, was bound to attend; and if he had attended, he would, of course, have had notice of the adjournment. This want of notice, therefore, is to be attributed to his own negligence. But if the notice was insufficient, the court, under the circumstances of the case, did not err in admitting the deposition. When the plaintiff's attorney read the deposition, he did not object. By his silence he lulled the defendant into security, at a time, when, if the objection had been made, he might have corrected the mistake, by giving new notice, and taking the deposition <i>de novo</i>. But instead of that, he concealed his objection until the deponent was dead, and when he knew that the defendant would totally lose the benefit of his testimony. In such a case the court will say, that the silence of the attorney, when he read the deposition, was a waiver of the notice.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p18">
<span class="num">18</span>
<p class="indent">2. As to the second objection, that Archibald M'Lain was not a competent witness, because he was the guardian of the defendant. It does appear upon the record, that the witness was the same Archibald M'Lain, who was the guardian. And besides, it appears, that before the trial the defendant himself was of age, and had leave to appear by attorney.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p19">
<span class="num">19</span>
<p class="indent">3. As to the objection, that the matter of the deposition was not competent evidence on the issues. The court did not say it was complete proof of payment, but that it was matter proper to be left to the jury upon the plea of payment, and from which a payment might be inferred.</p>
</div>
<p class="center"><i>March</i> 1.</p>
<div class="num" id="p20">
<span class="num">20</span>
<p class="indent">MARSHALL, Ch. J. delivered the opinion of the court to the following effect:</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p21">
<span class="num">21</span>
<p class="indent">This case comes up on two bills of exceptions.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p22">
<span class="num">22</span>
<p class="indent">1st. As to the notice of taking the deposition; and,</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p23">
<span class="num">23</span>
<p class="indent">2. As to its applicability.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p24">
<span class="num">24</span>
<p class="indent">1. As to the notice. There are two modes of taking depositions under the act of Congress. By the first, notice in certain cases is not necessary, but the forms prescribed must be strictly pursued. This deposition is not taken under that part of the act. By a subsequent part of the section, depositions may be taken by <i>dedimus potestatem</i>, according to common usage. The laws of Virginia, therefore, are to be referred to on the subject of notice. Those laws do not authorise notice to an attorney <i>at law</i>. The word <i>attorney</i>, in the act of assembly, means attorney <i>in fact</i>. An attorney at law is not compellable to receive notice; but he may consent to receive, or he may waive it, and shall not afterwards be permitted to object the want of it. But this deposition was not taken agreeably to the notice received. The commissioners did not adjourn from <i>day to day</i>, but passed over the intermediate time between the 12th and the 19th of August.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p25">
<span class="num">25</span>
<p class="indent">This circumstance, however, is not, by the court, deemed fatal, under the particular circumstances of this case, though without those circumstances it might, perhaps, be so considered. The agreement, that the deposition might be taken, whether the attorney were present or absent; his subsequent examination of the deposition, without objecting to the want of notice, and the death of the witness, were sufficient grounds for the defendant to believe, that the objection would be waived.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p26">
<span class="num">26</span>
<p class="indent">2. The objection to the competency of M'Lain, is totally unfounded, as it does not appear, upon the record, that he was the guardian; and especially, as the defendant became of full age, before the trial.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p27">
<span class="num">27</span>
<p class="indent">3. The objection to the applicability of the deposition, is also void of foundation. For, although it was not conclusive evidence, it was still admissible.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p28">
<span class="num">28</span>
<p class="indent">The court is, therefore, of opinion, that there is no error in the judgment below.</p>

<p>In this case each party has appealed from the sentence of the circuit court. Maley complains of that sentence because it subjects him to damages and costs for the value of the Mercator and her cargo, first captured by him, and afterwards taken out of his possession by a British privateer, and because, also, some items are admitted into the account, taken for the purpose of ascertaining the sum, for which he is liable, which ought to be excluded from it. Shattuck complains of the sentence because he was not allowed by the circuit court, all the items contained in the report, to the whole of which, he thinks himself entitled.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*488</span> In discussing the right of Shattuck to compensation for the Mercator and her cargo, the first question which presents itself is, was that vessel and cargo really his property?</p>
<p>Without reciting the various documents filed in the cause, it will be admitted that they demonstrate the affirmative of this question, unless the court be precluded from looking into them by the sentence in Jamaica, condemning the ship and cargo as lawful prize.</p>
<p>On the conclusiveness of the sentence of a foreign court of admiralty, it is not intended now to decide. Â— For the present, therefore, such sentence will be considered as conclusive, to the same extent which is allowed to it in the courts of Great Britain. But, in those courts, it has never been supposed to evidence more than its own correctness; it has consequently never been supposed to establish any particular fact, without which the sentence may have been rightly pronounced. If then, in the present case, the Mercator, with her cargo, may have been condemned as prize, although in fact they were both known to be the property of a neutral, the sentence of condemnation does not negative the averment that they both belonged to Jared Shattuck.</p>
<p>It is well known that a vessel libelled as enemy's property is condemned as prize, if she act in such manner as to forfeit the protection to which she is entitled by her neutral character. If, for example, a search be resisted, or an attempt be made to enter a blockaded port, the laws of war, as exercised by belligerents, authorise a condemnation as enemy's property, however clearly it may be proved that the vessel is, in truth, the vessel of a friend. Of consequence, this sentence, being only conclusive as to its own correctness, leaves the fact of real title open to investigation. This positive impediment to inquiry being removed, no doubt upon the subject can be entertained.</p>
<p>It being proved that the Mercator and her cargo belonged to Jared Shattuck, who, though born in the United States, had removed to the island of St. Thomas, <span class="star-pagination">*489</span> and had acquired all the commercial rights of his domicil before the occurrence of those circumstances which occasioned the acts of congress, under which this seizure is alleged to have been made, the case of the Charming Betsey determines that the vessel and cargo were not liable to forfeiture under those acts.</p>
<p>It remains, then, to inquire whether the Mercator appeared under such circumstances of suspicion as to justify her seizure.</p>
<p>On this point, too, the authority of the Charming Betsey appears to be decisive. In each case the vessel was built in America, and had been recently sold to a person born in the United States, who had become a Danish burgher before the rupture between this country and France; and both cases present the same circumstances of suspicion, derived from the practice of the island to cover American as Danish property. Â— The points of dissimilitude are, that in the Charming Betsey the captain and crew were of a description to give greater suspicion than the captain and crew of the Mercator; and in the Charming Betsey was found a proces verbal, which stated facts unfavourable to that vessel, whereas no similar paper was found in the Mercator. The only circumstance of suspicion attending the Mercator, which did not belong to the Charming Betsey, is that she was bound to Port-au-Prince, and was taken entering the port of Jacmel. This circumstance appears to be sufficiently accounted for, but if it was not, the court can perceive in it no evidence of her being American property which can weigh against the testimony offered by the papers that she was Danish. The documents on this point which were thought decisive in the case of the Charming Betsey, exist in this case also. The information of the captain, uncontradicted by any of his crew, in this case, as in that, is corroborated and confirmed by the documents on board the vessel.</p>
<p>The only paper, the absence of which could be important, was an authenticated burgher's brief proving the captain to have been a Danish subject. How far <span class="star-pagination">*490</span> the absence of this paper might have justified a suspicion in a belligerent that she was enemy-property, so as to excuse from damages for capture and detention, according to the usages of belligerents, the court will not undertake to determine; but it was a casualty which is not sufficient to justify a suspicion that the vessel was American. The burgher's brief is stated to have been in possession of the captain; but is supposed not to have been produced, and consequently it could have no influence on lieutenant Maley. However this may be, no inquiry respecting it was made, and he does not appear to have suggested any difficulty on that ground.</p>
<p>Unquestionably lieutenant Maley had a right to stop and to search the Mercator, and to exercise his judgment on the propriety of detaining her; but, in the exercise of that judgment, he appears to have come to a decision not warranted by the testimony presented to him. The circumstances of suspicion arising in the case, were not sufficiently strong to justify the seizure which was made.</p>
<p>But it is obvious, that lieutenant Maley suspected the Mercator to be a French, not an American vessel.</p>
<p>In his answer he says, that he mistook the captain for a Frenchman; in his letter of instructions, he speaks of the vessel as a prize; and in the protest of the American prize-master, she is denominated "a French prize." From these circumstances combined, it is supposed to be sufficiently apparent, that the mistake committed by lieutenant Maley, was in supposing the Mercator to be a French vessel liable to capture under the laws of the United States.</p>
<p>The argument of the attorney general, that lieutenant Maley is not liable for this loss, because it was produced by a superior force, which it was not in his power to resist, would have great weight, if the circumstances under which the Mercator appeared had been such as to justify her seizure. But the court is not of that opinion, and consequently that argument loses its application to this case.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*491</span> Neither is it conceived that the failure of Shattuck to appeal in time, destroys his claim on lieutenant Maley. He had certainly a right to abandon if he chose to do so, and to resort to the captor for damages.</p>
<p>In the opinion given in the circuit court, that the libellant was entitled to compensation for the Mercator and her cargo, this court can perceive no error: but in so much of the report of the commissioners appointed to adjust the account as is affirmed, some unimportant inaccuracies appear.</p>
<p>In its circumstances, this case so strongly resembles that of the Charming Betsey, that the court will be governed by the rule there laid down. In pursuance of that rule, the rejection of the premium for insurance, that premium not having been paid, is approved; but the rejection of the claim for outfits of the vessel, and the necessary advance to the crew is disapproved. Â— Although the general terms used in the case of the Charming Betsey would seem to exclude this item from the account, yet the particular question was not under the consideration of the court, and it is conceived to stand on the same principles with the premium of insurance if actually paid, which was expressly allowed. But this claim is nearly balanced by two items in the account which were admitted, as this court thinks, improperly.</p>
<p>One is the charge of 540 dollars for the expense of soliciting compensation from the United States. The court can perceive no reason for charging this expense to lieutenant Maley.</p>
<p>The other is the charge of 326 dollars and twelve cents, the account of Ross and Hall, for expenses in England.</p>
<p>Had the appeal been prosecuted in time by Shattuck, it is scarcely possible to doubt, but that the sentence of the court, in Jamaica, would have been reversed, in which case it would have been reasonable, that the expense of the prosecution should have been paid by Lieutenant Maley. But as it was not prosecuted in time, in consequence of which, the proceeds of the vessel and <span class="star-pagination">*492</span> cargo were lost, it is not conceived, that lieutenant Maley ought to be charged with the costs of a subsequent ineffectual attempt, not made at his instance, to repair the original neglect.</p>
<p>What may be the claim of Shattuck, on the government of the United States, for this sum, is not for this court to inquire; but his claim against lieutenant Maley is not admitted.</p>
<p>This court affirms so much of the sentence of the circuit court, as awards compensation for the Mercator and her cargo, to the libellant, and approves of the sentence on the report of the commissioners, except as to that part which rejects the claim for advances for the outfits of the vessel, and the wages of the crew, and which admits the charges of 540 dollars, on account of the expenses attending the application to the government of the United States, and of 326 dollars and twelve cents, on account of expenses attendant on the ineffectual attempt which was made to prosecute an appeal in England. In these respects, the account is to be reformed, for which purpose, so much of the sentence of the circuit court, as respects this part of the subject, is reversed, and the case is remanded to the circuit court to be further proceeded in, as to justice shall appertain.</p>

<p><span class="star-pagination">*368</span> E.J. Lee, for the plaintiffs in error.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*372</span> A voyage may be changed by taking on board a consignment to a different port; and the consignment will be evidence of the change. Or it may be changed by varying the plan of the adventure before the commencement of the risk; but a deviation takes place in the execution of the original plan. Therefore, an intention to alter the voyage will destroy the contract. Millar, 431.</p>
<p>To vary in the smallest particular from the original plan of the voyage, constitutes an alteration. Millar, 392.</p>
<p>In the present case the plan of the voyage was fixed by the policy, and on the 10th of August the vessel had actually cleared out with an intent to pursue it; after which, she discharged her ballast, and took in 30 hogsheads of sugar, to be delivered in Baltimore. This not only altered the original plan of the voyage, but increased the risk of capture, by increasing the value of the prize.</p>
<p>The case of Stot v. Vaughan, cited in Marshall, 232, 4 Williams' cases, 296, determined by Lord Kenyon, is in favour of the underwriters upon this point.</p>
<p>The case of Kewley v. Ryan, 2 H. Bl. 343, is the only one which has the appearance of opposition. But that case will be found to be unlike the present, in the following particulars:</p>
<p>1. In Kewley &amp; Ryan the vessel sailed from Grenada for Liverpool, which was the voyage insured, but with an intention to touch at Cork, which was in the usual course from Grenada to Liverpool. But, in the present case, the vessel sailed for Baltimore, with an intention to come round to Alexandria from Baltimore, which is not in the course from Kingston to Alexandria.</p>
<p>2. In Kewley v. Ryan the vessel intended only to touch at Cork; but, in the case at bar, the vessel sailed on a trading voyage for Baltimore. Stitt v. Wardell, 2 Esp. Rep. 610.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*373</span> 3. The Eliza altered the plan of the original adventure, by taking in sugar for Baltimore; but in Kewley v. Ryan it does not appear that the original plan was changed.</p>
<p>4. The risk was increased by taking the cargo for Baltimore, but the intention of touching at Cork did not increase the risk.</p>
<p>Independent of these differences between the two cases, it is very questionable whether the determination in Kewley v. Ryan is correct upon principle. It establishes a doctrine which enables the insured to defraud underwriters, by making the evidence of intention to vary the voyage, depend upon the single testimony of the master, which is apt to bend to the interest of his employers. It too often happens, that insurance cases depend upon the same kind of testimony.</p>
<p>The case of Kewley v. Ryan is also in principle contradicted by that of Middlewood v. Blakes, 7 T.R. 162. Marshall, 406, note (b.)</p>
<p>2d. The 2d point is, that if the plaintiffs are entitled to recover any thing, they can recover only for a partial loss; for if an actual total loss has happened, it has arisen from the negligence and misconduct of the plaintiffs, or their agents, in not doing the best in their power for all concerned.</p>
<p>The consideration of this question will involve that of the right of the plaintiffs to abandon at the time they offered to abandon; which is the 3d point in the cause.</p>
<p>In many instances the practice of abandoning has been extended too far. The insured should in no case be permitted to abandon, where the effects insured, or the greater part of them, still exist and are in the power of the insured.</p>
<p>The general rule is, that the insured may abandon in all cases where, by means of any of the perils insured against, the voyage is totally lost, or not worth pursuing, or where the thing insured is so damaged as to be of <span class="star-pagination">*374</span> little or no value to the owner, or where the salvage is very high, or where what is saved is of less value than the freight, or where further expense is necessary, and the insurer will not undertake, at all events, to pay that expense.</p>
<p>These principles are declared in the following cases: <span class="citation no-link"><span class="volume">2</span> <span class="reporter">Bur.</span> <span class="page">683</span></span>, Goss v. Withers. <span class="citation no-link"><span class="volume">2</span> <span class="reporter">Bur.</span> <span class="page">1198</span></span>, Hamilton v. Mendez. 7 T.R. 421, Aguilar v. Rodgers. 1 Dall. Rep. 11, Story v. Strettell. Park. 165. 4 Williams' cases, 373, 376.</p>
<p>The capture or arrest of a vessel, or any detention, is prima facie a total loss, and immediately upon the capture, or at any time while the capture continues, the insured may abandon, and give notice, and thereby entitle himself to claim as for a total loss. But this must be done while the insured knows of the continuance of the capture, and not after he has information of the recovery or safety of the vessel. M`Master v. Shoolbred, 1 Esp. Rep. 237. Marshall, 494, 501.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the recapture does not necessarily deprive the insured of the right to abandon. For, if in consequence of the capture, the voyage is lost, or not worth pursuing, if the salvage be very high, or if further expense be necessary, and the insurer will not undertake to pay that expense, the insured may abandon. Therefore the rule is, that if the thing insured be recovered before any loss is paid, the insured is entitled to claim as for a total or partial loss, according to the situation of the case at the time when he makes his claim. For there is no vested right to a total loss until the insured elects to abandon.</p>
<p>There are two cases which will be cited for the defendants in error. Pringle v. Hartley, 3 Atk. 195, and Goss v. Withers, <span class="citation no-link"><span class="volume">2</span> <span class="reporter">Bur.</span> <span class="page">683</span></span>, neither of which is like the present.</p>
<p>In the case of Pringle v. Hartley, the salvage amounted to a moiety of the value of the vessel insured; and there was no person present to give security or answer for that moiety.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*375</span> The case of Goss v. Withers was an insurance on the ship and goods. One fourth of the goods were thrown overboard to preserve the vessel and the residue of the cargo. After this the vessel was captured by the French. The master, mate and all the sailors, except an apprentice boy and a landsman, were taken out and sent to France. The ship remained eight days in the hands of the French, and was retaken by a British privateer, and on the 18th of January was carried into port for adjudication. Immediate notice was given and an offer to abandon.</p>
<p>But before her capture, the ship, in a storm, was separated from her convoy, and disabled for proceeding on her voyage, without going into port to refit. The residue of her cargo was spoiled while she was refitting, after the offer to abandon, and before she could be refitted. The salvage was a moiety; the master and mariners were prisoners; the charter-party dissolved; the freight, except for the goods saved, was lost; and the voyage was not worth pursuing.</p>
<p>But the situation of the Eliza was very different. She sailed from Jamaica on the 17th of August, was captured on the 22d, recaptured in less than three days, and on the 26th was brought into Kingston, the very port from which she had sailed only nine days before, and where the agents of the insured were. The salvage was only one eighth, and the coffee on board, belonging to the plaintiffs, would have been more than sufficient in value to pay the whole salvage, and all the charges and costs, which did not exceed 909 dollars, even when attended with the costs of the libel, sale and commissions.</p>
<p>If they had rated the vessel at 3,800 dollars, the sum insured, yet the salvage would have been only 475 dollars.</p>
<p>The point decided in Goss and Withers was, that a title to restitution cannot take away a vested right to abandon, if the vessel be unfit to perform the voyage.</p>
<p>There is nothing in the record which shows that, at the time of the recapture, the Eliza was unfit to perform the voyage.</p>
<p>The abandonment of a vessel is an extreme remedy, which the insured has in his power, but which he ought <span class="star-pagination">*376</span> not to be permitted to use, when he has another remedy which will completely indemnify him for the injury he has actually sustained.</p>
<p>This case, we contend, ought to be decided upon the principles which governed that of Hamilton v. Mendez, <span class="citation no-link"><span class="volume">2</span> <span class="reporter">Bur.</span> <span class="page">1198</span></span>. There the ship was captured on the 6th of May, by a French privateer, and all her hands, excepting two, were taken out. On the 23d she was recaptured by a British ship of war, and sent into a British port, where she arrived on the 6th of June. As soon as the insured heard of the capture, he wrote and offered to abandon to the underwriters. They refused to receive the abandonment, but offered to pay the salvage, and all the losses and charges which the insured had sustained by the capture. The question was, whether, on the 26th June, the insured had a right to abandon and recover as for a total loss. The court decided, that he had no right to abandon, and that he could recover as for a partial loss only. The principle of that case is, that if the voyage be only temporarily interrupted, the property, upon the recapture, returns to the owner pledged to the recaptor for the amount of salvage. This doctrine is also stated in the case of Mills v. Fletcher, Doug. 219, and Thellusson v. Fletcher, 1 Esp. Rep. 73.</p>
<p>The actual loss which the insured sustained, was not a total loss, until rendered so by their own negligence or misconduct, or that of their agents. It only amounted to 909 dollars, including salvage. Even if the vessel had been valued at the price insured, viz. 3,800 dollars, the salvage (which by Stat. 33 Geo. 3, c. 66, cannot exceed one eighth) would have amounted only to 475 dollars, which added to the other expenses, would not have exceeded 1,000 dollars.</p>
<p>This sum ought to have been paid by the agents of the insured, who had in their possession funds of their principal, out of which it might have been paid. But it does not appear that they made any effort, or offer to pay it, or to prevent the sale; or any proposition to ascertain the value of the vessel, otherwise than by a sale. They did not do the best in their power for all concerned, but calmly stood by and saw the vessel sacrificed, when they had the power of preventing it.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*377</span> The insured, therefore, cannot, by abandonment, turn a partial into a total loss. Esp. Rep. 73.</p>
<p>It appears upon the record that the insured were anxious to sell the vessel, and this may account for the want of exertion on the part of their agents to prevent a sale, which would charge the underwriters with the full value of 3,800 dollars.</p>
<p>4th. The loss of the register was not equivalent to the loss of the vessel, and was not an event against which the insurance was made.</p>
<p>But the loss of the register might have been supplied by another document, such as a consular certificate, stating the circumstances attending the loss, which would have enabled the vessel to perform the voyage insured, 1 Rob. 184, The Betty Cathcart. 8 T.R. 198, Christie v. Secretan. The want of a register would not have occasioned a forfeiture of the vessel, but would only have subjected her to the inconvenience of being considered and treated as a foreign bottom.</p>
<p>5th. The not communicating to the underwriters the intention of going to Baltimore vacated the policy, as the risk was thereby increased. Marsh. 347. <span class="citation no-link"><span class="volume">3</span> <span class="reporter">Bur.</span> <span class="page">1909</span></span>, Carter v. Boehm. 1 W. Bl. 594, S.C. Millar, 450.</p>
<p>Simms &amp; Swann, contra. Contended, 1. That the voyage commenced was the voyage insured. 2. That the insured had a right to abandon and recover as for a total loss.</p>
<p>1. A policy of insurance, like every other written agreement, is to be construed according to the intention of the parties. The understanding in this case was that the underwriters should take all the risk of a voyage from Jamaica to Alexandria; and consequently they took the risk of the voyage from Jamaica to the Chesapeake Bay, through which a vessel must pass to arrive at Alexandria.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*378</span> We admit the intention to deviate after entering the Chesapeake, but we insist that the voyage and risk insured had commenced; and that the vessel was in the actual prosecution of that voyage when the loss happened. In such a case, although there was an intention to deviate, the insured had a right to abandon. Park, 314. Str. 1249, Foster v. Wilmer. Burns on Insurance, 107. 2 H. Bl. 343, Kewley v. Ryan. 2 New-York Term Rep. 274, Henshaw v. Marine Insurance Company.</p>
<p>In the case of Wooldridge v. Boydell, there was no intention of going at all to the place mentioned in the policy.</p>
<p>The only point in the case of Stitt v. Wardell, 2 Esp. Rep. 610, is the difference between touching and trading at a port. In that case there was an actual trading, but here was only an intention to trade.</p>
<p>In Beatson v. Haworth, 6 T.R. 531, the decision was merely that if the voyage described be to B and C, the vessel deviates by going to C first, and afterwards to B, although C be the nearest port.</p>
<p>In Way v. Modigliani, 2 T.R. 30, the real ground of the opinion of the court is, an actual deviation by the vessel having sailed for and stopped to fish on the Banks, instead of sailing directly from Newfoundland to England.</p>
<p>The opinion of Roccus, cited in a note to Marshall, 406, is contradicted by that of Emerigon, also cited in the same note Â— and the latter seems to be the better opinion.</p>
<p>If the alteration of the voyage takes place before the risk is commenced, it becomes a different voyage; but if after, then it is only a deviation. Millar, 117.</p>
<p>In the present case, the risk commenced at Jamaica, and before the alteration of the voyage was contemplated.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*379</span> It was to terminate at Alexandria. When the terminus a quo, and the terminus ad quem, are the same, the voyage is the same.</p>
<p>2. The loss itself, was, in fact, total, and unless the insured have been in fault, they ought to recover for a total loss.</p>
<p>The loss of the register alone was sufficient to defeat the whole voyage, and if the vessel had sailed without it, and had been lost, the underwriters would have been discharged by that very fact of the vessel sailing without proper documents. It would so increase the risk of loss by seizure and condemnation, as to vacate the policy. If she had been found sailing without a register, she would have been considered by the British laws as an alien vessel, and if found trading from a British colony, would have been liable to condemnation. Â— Reeve on Ship. 46, 379, 429. Bryan &amp; Co. were not the general agents of the defendants in error. Their authority ceased when the vessel was dispatched and had sailed from Jamaica for Alexandria. They were not authorized to sacrifice the property of the insured in their hands, if they had any, to raise money to pay the salvage and expenses. It is true, the master had an implied authority to do what was fit and proper for the benefit of all concerned; but he was not authorised to send out the vessel without a register, and she could never get a new one unless her owners (the insured) should change their domicil. No document could supply the place of that which itself never could have been obtained, and to which the party was not entitled.</p>
<p>The exception is to the refusal of the court to give the instruction prayed. This instruction would have been improper for two reasons.</p>
<p>1. It would have been conclusive of the whole cause, and no such instruction can be given, unless all the evidence is stated, and unless the bill of exceptions avers it to be the whole evidence. This bill of exceptions does not contain the whole evidence, nor such an averment.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*380</span> 2. The instruction prayed involves the decision of a fact, which the jury only were competent to find, viz. whether the damage amounted to more than half the value of the thing insured. Mills v. Fletcher, Doug. 230. This fact is not stated in the bill of exceptions, nor any other fact from which the court can infer it. It contains no evidence that the master had funds to pay the salvage and charges.</p>
<p>The evidence shows the loss to be actually total. The information of the capture, recapture, libel for salvage, and sale to a stranger, all came to the insured at the same time; and there is no evidence of fraud or collusion. The only allegation is, that the master did not do every thing in his power to prevent a total loss. But this allegation is unsupported by evidence. Even if, by a sacrifice of the cargo, he had raised money enough to pay the salvage, expenses, costs, charges and repairs, he must have obtained a new crew, and then could not have sailed without a register.</p>
<p>The voyage was completely destroyed; and, upon an abandonment, which the insured had a right to make, relief would have been refused to the underwriters, even in equity. 3 Atk. 195, Pringle v. Hartley. Marshall, 485.</p>
<p>C. Lee, in reply. There are two bills of exceptions to the opinion of the court.</p>
<p>1st. To the instruction given in favour of the plaintiff below, that there was no deviation from the voyage insured, and that the voyage insured was actually commenced.</p>
<p>2d. To the refusal of the court to instruct the jury, that if the facts stated in that bill of exceptions, should be proved to their satisfaction, they ought not to find a verdict for a total, but at most for a partial loss.</p>
<p>1. The voyage insured was a direct voyage from Kingston in Jamaica, to Alexandria in Virginia. But the voyage commenced was a voyage from Kingston to Baltimore, and from thence to Alexandria. Baltimore <span class="star-pagination">*381</span> not being in the direct course from Kingston to Alexandria, the voyage commenced was not a direct voyage from Kingston to Alexandria, and, therefore, was not the voyage insured. There can be no necessity of referring to authorities to show that, in a policy, a voyage from one place to another, always means a direct voyage in the usual course; because, upon this principle is founded the whole doctrine of deviation. But the cases of Beatson v. Haworth, 6 T.R. 531. Delaney v. Stoddert, 1 T.R. 22, and Middlewood v. Blakes, 7 T.R. 162, show with what strictness it has been maintained.</p>
<p>If the direct voyage was not commenced, the commencement of an indirect, circuitous voyage, will avail nothing. The voyage insured was not commenced, Doug. 16, Wooldridge v. Boydell. 2 T.R. 30, Way v. Modigliani. Even if the risk is diminished by the circuitous course, it is not a justification of the voyage, and will not support the policy. Millar, 377, 382.</p>
<p>The case of Kewley v. Ryan, 2 H. Bl. 343, is relied upon by the defendants in error. But the law of that case is doubted by Marshall, 232, who refers to the case of Stott v. Vaughan, decided in the king's bench, in 1794, and is opposed to the case of Wooldridge v. Boydell.</p>
<p>Kewley v. Ryan differs essentially from the present case. The intention in the former was only to touch at Cork, in the way to Liverpool. Whether Cork is not usually touched at in such voyages, does not appear; but no cargo was on board to be delivered at Cork. The only port of delivery was Liverpool.</p>
<p>In the present case, a considerable cargo was received on freight, deliverable at Baltimore. The intention, therefore, was not merely to touch, but to trade at Baltimore. It was one of the principal objects of the voyage. To touch at a port, differs essentially from delivering a cargo, and trading at a port. 2 N.Y. Term Rep. Williams v. Smith, refers to Stitt v. Wardell, decided by Lord Kenyon, in 1797, Marshall, 187. After clearing for Alexandria, to receive a cargo for <span class="star-pagination">*382</span> Baltimore, to be delivered there for trade, and to sail with intention to go to Baltimore first, was a complete alteration of the voyage insured.</p>
<p>The opinion in Kewley v. Ryan, if understood rightly, does not decide this case against the underwriters. The court says, "where the termini of the intended voyage are really the same as those described in the policy, it is to be considered as the same voyage."</p>
<p>The word termini does not mean merely the beginning and end of a thing, but all the limits; and, in regard to a voyage, it means also the intermediate ports of delivery for any part of the cargo.</p>
<p>In the present case the policy expresses but one port of delivery, the voyage commenced was to two; one of which was out of the course to that mentioned in the policy.</p>
<p>The case of Way v. Modigliani, was not decided on the ground of deviation, but expressly on the ground of non-inception. Upon this point, the opinion of Buller, J. is full.</p>
<p>Wooldridge v. Boydell was not decided on the fact, that there was no intention of sailing to the port mentioned in the policy, but upon the fact that the vessel had actually sailed for a different port.</p>
<p>The weight of the case of Kewley v. Ryan, therefore, is diminished.</p>
<p>1. Because it stands contradicted.</p>
<p>2. It differs essentially from the case before the court, and is not decisive.</p>
<p>3. It may be reconciled with the doctrine advanced in this case by the plaintiffs in error, and, if so understood, is in their favour.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*383</span> 4. If understood as the defendants in error contend it ought to be, it is not law.</p>
<p>2. The 2d bill of exceptions states a case, which would justify the instruction prayed by the defendants below.</p>
<p>Bryan &amp; Co. were the agents and correspondents of the owners Â— Patton also was an agent Â— having gone out in the vessel as supercargo, and the owners are answerable for their negligence.</p>
<p>On the 24th of September, Bell, the master, and Patton, the supercargo, by their protest, abandoned the vessel and cargo to the underwriters, when both were safe in the harbour of Kingston, liable only to a small salvage, and to some expenses; and, when the coffee belonging to the defendants in error, and then on board, was more than sufficient to pay all the demands against the vessel. There was no necessity of selling the vessel. Her value might have been ascertained in some other mode. Upon application to the court of admiralty, appraisers would have been appointed. But the agents neither attempted to agree with the recaptors for the amount of the salvage, nor applied to the court to appoint appraisers, but suffered the expenses to be increased unnecessarily, by the admiralty process, and by the commissions on the sale.</p>
<p>The agents of the owners ought to have done as much to increase the amount saved, as if no insurance had been made. It was their duty to do the best for all concerned. If they did not, and if by their negligence the loss has been converted from a partial to a total loss, the underwriters ought not to suffer. Their contract was a contract of indemnity against unavoidable loss, and the insured were bound to use the same care and diligence which a prudent man would use in securing his own property.</p>
<p>As to the loss of the register, it would not have been a cause of condemnation. The law cited from Reeves applies only to a vessel which never had a register, and <span class="star-pagination">*384</span> not to one whose register has been destroyed by accident.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>March 4.</h2>
<p>MARSHALL, Ch. J. did not sit in the trial of this cause.</p>
<p>The other judges, except CHASE, J. whose ill health prevented his attendance, gave their opinions seriatim.</p>
<p>JOHNSON, J. Upon the trial of this cause, in the court below, two grounds of defence were assumed by the plaintiffs in error.</p>
<p>1. That the policy had been avoided by a deviation from the voyage insured.</p>
<p>2. That if the insured were entitled to recover at all, it could only be for an average, not a total loss.</p>
<p>In the argument before this court, the first ground was varied, and the plaintiffs in error contended, "that the risk insured was never entered upon."</p>
<p>Without considering the propriety of entering upon the discussion of a question so materially different from that made in the bill of exception, I will only remark "that it was judicious in the counsel to abandon an opinion as inconsistent with natural reason, as it is with the established doctrine of the law of insurance. An intent to do an act, can never amount to the commission of the act itself. That an intended deviation will not vitiate a policy, and that the vessel remains covered by her insurance until she reaches the point of divergency, and actually turns off from the due course of the voyage insured, is a doctrine well understood among mercantile men, and has uniformly governed the decisions of the British courts from the case of Foster &amp; Wilmer to the present time.</p>
<p>The doctrine now insisted on by the plaintiffs in error, was probably suggested by some incorrect expressions attributed to Lord Mansfield in the case of Wooldridge <span class="star-pagination">*385</span> &amp; Boyde'l. It is said that the Judge in that case expressed an opinion, that "if a ship be insured from A to B, and before her departure the insured determine that she shall call at C, which is out of the usual course of the voyage from A to B, this is rather a different voyage than an intended deviation." This opinion was certainly in no wise material to the decision of that case, and is expressly contradicted by the case of Kewley &amp; Ryan, and a case, which I consider with much respect, decided in the State of New-York, between Henshaw and the Marine Insurance Company of New-York. We can only vindicate the accuracy of his Lordship's opinion in the case which he states by supposing, that his mind was intent upon those cases of intended deviation, in which a suppressio veri, or necessary increase of risk, are the grounds of decision.</p>
<p>The ordinary rule for ascertaining the identity of a voyage insured, is by adverting to the termini. A rule which is certainly correct as far at it extends, but in the rigid application of which, it is easy to conceive that cases may occur in which it would bear injuriously upon the insurer. If it has any defect, it is in not extending far enough the claim to indemnity, as the terminus ad quem may in many instances be relinquished without any possible increase of risk, or even without varying the risk, except only as to lessening its duration. I will instance the case of an insurance from America to St. Petersburg, when the vessel, in fact, is to terminate her voyage at Copenhagen; or the case of an insurance to Alexandria, in Virginia, when the vessel is to terminate her voyage at Georgetown, in Maryland.</p>
<p>Whether the risk insured against in this case, ever was incurred, I would test by the question, whether, if the Eliza had arrived in safety, or even had sailed for Europe, the insured might have legally demanded a return of the premium? I presume not. The insurance being at and from the port of Kingston, the risk commenced during her stay in port, and cannot be apportioned when thus blended, but was wholly and indefeasibly vested in the underwriters, although the vessel <span class="star-pagination">*386</span> had forfeited her policy by shaping her course for Europe the moment she had left the port of Kingston. In the case before us, she adhered to her ultimate destination, and the forfeiture of her insurance could not have been incurred until after entering the Chesapeake and actually bearing away farther eastward than was consistent with her course to the Potowmack.</p>
<p>2. With regard to the question, whether it be a case of total or average loss, a very few observations will suffice to satisfy the mind that the judgment below is correct.</p>
<p>If, under every combination of circumstances, the insured is bound to procure money at whatever interest, or to raise it at whatever sacrifice of property, to defray the disbursements for repairs, reshipping a crew, salvage, costs of suit, and every incidental expense, this will be shifting the loss from the insurer to the insured. Should it be admitted, that in the case before us, the insured were under any greater obligation to ransom and refit the vessel than the insurer, the circumstances in evidence are sufficient to excuse him. Unsuccessful attempts had been made to dispose of both vessel and cargo, and as to raising money on bottomry, who would have accepted the security of a vessel embarrassed by the loss of her register, to a degree, the extent of which could not possibly be foreseen; a bond for money to become due on the arrival of a vessel which perhaps might never be able to sail, or if she did sail without her necessary documents, would be exposed to innumerable hazards, and among them, the forfeiture of her insurance for that very cause.</p>
<p>It is true, that a case of capture and recapture, where the two events are communicated, before an election to abandon has been actually communicated to the underwriters, will not, of itself, sanction an abandonment. Â— Yet, it is equally true, that in case of capture, a recapture alone will not deprive the party of his right to abandon. The consequences of the capture and recapture, the effect produced upon the fate of the voyage, must govern the right of the parties. This effect is always a matter of evidence, and must rest much upon <span class="star-pagination">*387</span> the discretion of a jury. This doctrine is well illustrated in the cases of Pringle &amp; Hartley, and Goss &amp; Withers.</p>
<p>In the case before us, the information of the capture, recapture, and sale, was communicated in the same letter. The loss was then certainly total, and as the insurers cannot charge the insured with any premeditated design to involve the vessel in the difficulties which broke up the voyage, I think they ought to bear the loss.</p>
<p>Much has been said about the liability of the insured for the misconduct of his agents, but as all amounts to a charge that they did not make use of forced means to raise money for the release of the vessel, an obligation not incumbent upon them, it does not appear to me that the extent of the liability of the insured for the acts of the captain or supercargo, after the death-stroke is given to the voyage, need be considered.</p>
<p>WASHINGTON, J. There are but two questions in this cause, which I deem worthy of particular consideration; for the last exception is, to the refusal of the court to give an opinion upon a matter of fact, and for which no foundation was laid by the evidence spread upon the record, even if it had been proper for the court, in such a case, to give an answer to the question propounded. I, also, lay out of the case, the award mentioned in the declaration, not only because no breach is assigned which applies to it, but because no opinion was asked of, or given by, the court respecting it.</p>
<p>The first subject which claims attention is, whether, upon the facts stated in the second bill of exceptions, the court below was right in the direction given to the jury, that there was no deviation, at the time of capture, from the voyage insured, and that the voyage insured was actually commenced. The facts, material to the decision of this point, are, that the Eliza cleared out at Kingston, for Alexandria, and a bill of lading was signed by the master, to deliver her cargo at Alexandria. That after her <span class="star-pagination">*388</span> clearances were obtained, she took in a cargo for Baltimore, and bills of lading were signed for delivering the same at that port. That the captain sailed from Kingston, with an intention, previously formed, of proceeding first to Baltimore, and there landing part of her cargo, and then to go to Alexandria, but she was captured before her arrival at the dividing point, between Baltimore and Alexandria.</p>
<p>It is admitted, that this is not a case of deviation, because the intention formed at Kingston, before the voyage commenced, of going first to Baltimore, was never carried into execution. The only question then is, whether the voyage described in the policy was changed or not? As to this, there is no difference of opinion at the bar, respecting the legal effect of an alteration of the voyage, on the contract of indemnity; it is, and must be conceded, that the policy never attached. But the difficulty is in determining what circumstances do, in point of law, constitute such an alteration as will avoid the policy.</p>
<p>The criticisms of the counsel for the plaintiffs in error, upon the rule contended for by the defendants, ought not, in my opinion, to avail them, if that rule be firmly established by uniform decisions: for in questions which respect the rights of property, it is better to adhere to principles once fixed, though, originally, they might not have been perfectly free from all objection, than to unsettle the law, in order to render it more consistent with the dictates of sound reason.</p>
<p>The first case we meet with, upon this subject, is that of Carter v. The Royal Exchange Assurance Company, which is cited in Foster v. Wilmer, decided in the 19 Geo. 2. The former was an insurance on a ship from Honduras to London, and the latter on a ship from Carolina to Lisbon, and at and from thence to Bristol. In both, a cargo was taken in to be delivered at an intermediate port; but the loss having happened before the ship had arrived at the dividing point, the insurers were held liable, upon the ground that nothing more was intended than a deviation, which, not being carried into execution, did not avoid the policy.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*389</span> The case of Wooldridge v. Boydell, is next in point of time. This was an insurance on a ship, at and from Maryland to Cadiz. She cleared for Falmouth, and a bond was given to land the whole cargo in Britain. No evidence was given that the vessel was bound to Cadiz; she was taken before she came to the dividing point. At the trial of this cause, Lord Mansfield told the jury, that if they thought the voyage intended, was to Cadiz, they were to find for the assured; but if there was no design to go to that port, then they were to find for the defendant, and the ground upon which the court decided the motion for a new trial was, that there never was an intention to go to Cadiz. But it is plain, that if Cadiz had been intended as the ultimate port of destination, the clearing out for an intermediate port, with an intention to land the cargo there, would not have been considered as any thing more than an intended deviation.</p>
<p>Way and Modigliani was decided in 1787, and was an insurance at and from the 20th October, 1786, from Newfoundland to Falmouth, with liberty to touch at Ireland. She sailed on the 1st of October, from Newfoundland, went to the Banks and fished till the 7th, and then sailed for England, and was lost on the 20th. The reasons assigned for the decision of this case, give it the appearance of an authority unfavourable to the doctrine laid down in the above cases. But the weight of it is greatly diminished, if it be not destroyed, by the following considerations: 1st. That as there was a clear deviation, it was unnecessary to decide the other point that the policy did not attach; and, 2d. That this latter opinion seems to have been entertained only by one of the court, and even this judge seems to have relied very much upon the fact, that the vessel sailed to the Banks. 3d. From what is said in Kewley &amp; Ryan, it would appear that the ship, when she left Newfoundland, did not sail for England, and of course the voyage insured never was commenced.</p>
<p>Kewley &amp; Ryan, decided in 1794, was a policy on goods from Genoa to Liverpool. The ship sailed on that voyage, but it was intended, as plainly appeared by the clearances, to touch at Cork. She was lost, however, before she arrived at the dividing point; and the decision conformed to those given in the preceding cases, the <span class="star-pagination">*390</span> termini of the intended voyage being really the same as those described in the policy.</p>
<p>The case of Stott &amp; Vaughan, decided at Nisi Prius, in 1794, before Lord Kenyon, seems opposed to the principles laid down in the preceding cases, and, if we have an accurate report of it, is inconsistent with the decisions of the same judge, in Kewley and Ryan, and other cases.</p>
<p>Murdoch and Potts, decided in 1795, was, in principle, as strong a case of a change of voyage, as that of Wooldridge and Boydell, but equally contributes to explain the general doctrine laid down in all the cases. For in this, the terminus ad quem was, most obviously, St. Domingo, where the freight insured was payable, or some port, other than Norfolk, where the ship was to cal for the sole purpose of receiving orders.</p>
<p>The last English case which I shall notice, is that of Middlewood and Blakes, decided in 1797. It was an insurance on the Arethusa, at and from London to Jamaica, for which place she cleared out; but the captain was bound by orders, to call at Cape St. Nicola Mole, in order to land stores there, pursuant to a charter-party. She was captured after she had passed the dividing point of three several courses to Jamaica, but before she had reached the subdividing point of the continuing course to Jamaica and that leading to the Mole. The whole court considered this as a case of deviation only, and Lawrence J. was so strongly impressed with the weight of former decisions, that, not attending to this obvious objection to the plaintiff's recovery, but considering the termini of the voyage intended to be the same with those mentioned in the policy, his first opinion inclined to the side of the plaintiff.</p>
<p>The case of Henshaw and The Marine Insurance Company, decided in the supreme court of New-York, confirms the principles of the above cases, and would command my respect were it opposed to them.</p>
<p>The rule, then, which I consider to be firmly established, by a long and uniform course of decisions, is, that if the ship sail from the port mentioned in the policy, with an intention to go to the port, or ports, also described <span class="star-pagination">*391</span> therein, a determination to call at an intermediate port, either with a view to land a cargo, for orders, or the like, is not such a change of the voyage as to prevent the policy from attaching, but is merely a case of deviation, if the intention be carried into execution, or be persisted in after the vessel has arrived at the dividing point.</p>
<p>The next question is, whether the court below, erred in refusing to instruct the jury, that if they believed the facts stated in the first bill of exceptions, they were to find an average and not a total loss? The defendants in error, contend, that by the capture and recapture of the vessel, under the various circumstances of loss of crew, inability to pay the salvage and expenses, loss of register, &amp;c. the voyage insured was completely defeated, and, therefore, the assured had a right to abandon and demand as for a total loss.</p>
<p>On the other side it is insisted, that the captain might, in a variety of ways, have prevented the sale of the vessel, and that if he had done the best in his power for the interests of all concerned, he might have liberated the vessel from the lien of the captors, and have performed his voyage in safety to Alexandria, without any other inconvenience than this temporary interruption, and the payment of salvage and expenses. If so, that it was not competent to the assured, under these circumstances, to convert a loss partial in its nature into a total one.</p>
<p>Whether the assured had a right to abandon, and recover as for a total loss, or not, was a question of law, dependent upon the point of fact, whether, upon the whole of the evidence, the voyage was broken up, and not worth pursuing; and in the consideration of this question, the jury would, of course, have inquired, amongst other matters, whether the captain had done what was best for the benefit of all concerned. The court might, with propriety, have stated the law arising upon this fact, which ever way the jury might find it, and indeed such would have been their duty, if a request to that effect had been made. But the court very correctly refused to give the direction as prayed, because, by doing so, they would have decided the important matter of fact, upon which the law was to arise, which was only proper for the determination of the jury. In the case of Mills <span class="star-pagination">*392</span> and Fletcher, which turned upon the question, whether the captain, by his conduct, had not made the loss a total one, Lord Mansfield would not decide whether the loss was total or not, but informed the jury, that they were to find as for a total loss, if they were satisfied that the captain had done what was best for the benefit of all concerned.</p>
<p>Upon the whole, then, I am of opinion, that the judgment ought to be affirmed.</p>
<p>PATERSON, J. This action was brought on a policy of insurance, which John and James H. Tucker, being British subjects, residents at Alexandria, had effected on the body of the sloop Eliza, her tackle, apparel, and furniture, to the value of 3,800 dollars, at and from Kingston, in the island of Jamaica, to Alexandria, in the state of Virginia. The policy bears date the 1st of September, 1801.</p>
<p>The first question to be considered is, whether the voyage, on which the sloop Eliza set out, was the same or a different voyage from the one insured? By the terms of the policy, it is stipulated, that the Eliza was to sail from Kingston to Alexandria; and it is stated in the bill of exceptions, that she did sail from Kingston, but with an intention to go first to Baltimore, and there deliver 20 hogsheads and 10 tierces of sugar, and then to proceed to Alexandria, which was the port of destination described in the policy. She cleared out at the custom-house in Kingston, on the 10th of August, 1801, for Alexandria, and the master signed a bill of lading to deliver her cargo at that place; after which he took in the sugar, to be delivered at Baltimore. It is contended on the part of the insurers, that the taking in the sugar, to be landed at Baltimore, constituted a different voyage from the one agreed upon, and vitiates the policy; or in other words, that the voyage which was the subject of the contract, was never commenced. From a review of the cases, which have been cited, the principle is established, that where the termini of a voyage are the same, an intention to touch at an intermediate port, though out of the direct course, and not mentioned in the policy, does not constitute a different voyage. In the present case the termini, or beginning and ending points of the intended <span class="star-pagination">*393</span> voyage, were precisely the same as those specified in the policy, to wit, from Kingston to Alexandria, and, in legal estimation, form one and the same voyage, notwithstanding the meditated deviation. The first reported case on this subject is Foster v. Wilmer, in 2 Str. 1249; in which Lee, C.J. held, that taking in salt to be delivered at Falmouth, a port not mentioned in the policy, before the vessel went to Bristol, to which place she was insured, was only an intention to deviate, and not a different voyage. And the chief justice, in delivering his opinion, mentioned the case of Carter v. The Royal Exchange Assurance Company, where the insurance was from Honduras to London, and a consignment to Amsterdam; a loss happened before she came to the dividing point between the two voyages, for which the insurer was held liable. The adjudication in Strange was in the 19 Geo. 2, and from that time down to the year 1794, we find no variation in the doctrine. A remarkable uniformity runs through the current of authorities on this subject. In Kewley v. Ryan, 2 H. Bl. 343, Trinity term, 1794, the principle is recognised; and in 2 New-York Term Rep. 274, Henshaw v. The Marine Insurance Company, February, 1805, it is fortified and considered as settled by the supreme court of that state. In a lapse of sixty years we find no alteration in the doctrine, which is sanctioned, and has become too deeply rooted and venerable by time, usage, and repeated adjudications, to be shaken and overturned at the present day. It has grown up into a clear, known, and certain rule, for the regulation of commercial negotiations, and is incorporated into the law merchant of the land. Where is the inconvenience, injustice, or danger of the rule? It operates in favour of the insurers, by a diminution of the risk, and not of the insured, who have the departure in contemplation; for if the vessel, after she has arrived at the point of separation, should deviate from the usual and direct road to her port of destination, the insurers would be entitled to the premium, and exonerated from responsibility. An intention to deviate, if it be not carried into effect, will not avoid the policy. There must be an actual deviation. The policy being "at and from," the risk commenced; there was also an actual inception of the voyage described; for the Eliza sailed from Kingston for Alexandria, was captured in a <span class="star-pagination">*394</span> direct course to the latter, before she reached the dividing point; and, therefore, the underwriters became liable for the loss.</p>
<p>The second point in the cause is, whether the insurers were liable for a total or a partial loss. And here a preliminary question presents itself. Was the abandonment made in proper time? When the Tuckers received information of the loss, it became incumbent on them to elect, whether they would abandon or not; and if they intended to abandon, it was incumbent on them to give notice of such intention to the underwriters. Our law has fixed no precise period, within which the abandonment shall be made, and notice of it shall be given to the insurers; but declares, that it shall be done within a reasonable time. In the case before us it appears, that John and James H. Tucker received information of the capture and recapture of the Eliza at the same time, in a letter from W. and B. Bryan and Co. dated on the 26th September, 1801; but it does not appear when the letter came to hand. On the 26th of November, 1801, the Tuckers offered to abandon the Eliza to the insurers, which offer was rejected. Can it, under these circumstances, be pretended, that the Tuckers were guilty of neglect, or that the abandonment was not made according to the settled rule? It was made within a reasonable time, and no neglect can justly be imputed to them. We must have some facts, whereon to build the charge of negligence, for it is not to be presumed; and the intervening period between the date of the letter and the time of abandonment, after making a due allowance for the passage of the letter, does not afford sufficient ground, on which to raise the imputation of neglect. This brings us to the great question in the cause, whether the insurers were liable for a total or an average loss. On the 22d August, 1801, the Eliza was captured by a Spanish armed schooner, in the usual course from Kingston to Baltimore and Alexandria, and a day or two afterwards was recaptured by a British sloop of war, and carried into Kingston on the 26th of the same month. The mere acts of capturing and recapturing are not of themselves sufficient to ascertain the nature and amount of the loss sustained. The loss may be total, though there is a recapture. Hamilton v. Mendez, <span class="citation no-link"><span class="volume">2</span> <span class="reporter">Bur.</span> <span class="page">1198</span></span>. Aguilar and others v. Rodgers, <span class="citation no-link"><span class="volume">7</span> <span class="reporter">Dall.</span> <span class="page"></span></span>&amp; E. 421. Whether the loss be partial or total, will depend upon the particular <span class="star-pagination">*395</span> circumstances of the case, which it becomes necessary to take into view. The Eliza was consigned to Bryan &amp; Co. at Kingston, who were authorised to dispose of her; they endeavoured to sell her, but without effect, and it is stated, that they could get no offer for her before she sailed from Kingston, nor since that time. Bryan &amp; Co. put on board 10 tierces of coffee, of the value of 1,000 dollars, belonging to the Tuckers, to be delivered at Alexandria; and when she was captured, all the seamen, except Bell, the ostensible master, and one man, were taken on board the Spanish schooner. The Eliza was navigated under a British register during the voyage; which register was lost by reason of the capture and recapture, and has never been found. After the recapture, the Eliza and her cargo were libelled in the vice-admiralty court for salvage; a claim was put in by Bryan &amp; Co. as agents for Eli Richards Patton, the real and navigating master and supercargo; and the sloop and cargo were adjudged to be lawful recaption on the high seas, and ordered to be restored, on paying to the recaptors one full eighth part of the value of the sloop and cargo for salvage, with full costs; and to ascertain the value it was further ordered, that the sloop and cargo should be forthwith sold by the claimants, unless the value should be otherwise agreed upon. The sloop was insured for 3,800 dollars, and sold for 915 dollars; the coffee sold for 1,000 dollars; and the costs, charges, and commissions, amounted to 909 dollars, which almost absorbed the sum for which the sloop was sold. It is not found, that the sloop had sustained no damage by the capture and recapture; and, considering the difference between 3,800 dollars, the value insured, and 909 dollars, the price for which she sold, the jury might, without other evidence, have presumed, that she had received considerable injury. From these facts taken together, the inference is rational and just, that the voyage was broke up and destroyed, and that the underwriters were liable for a total and not for an average loss. To repel this inference, and remove responsibility from the insurers, it has been urged in argument, that the agents for the Tuckers were guilty of gross neglect and misconduct. If Bryan &amp; Co. ceased to be agents after the sailing of the sloop, then <span class="star-pagination">*396</span> the captain became cloathed with an implied authority to do what was fit and right, and most conductive for the interest and benefit of all the concerned; and, therefore, whether the agency of Bryan &amp; Co. continued, or, being at an end, devolved by operation of law on the captain, is perfectly immaterial; for the question still recurs, whether the actual or implied agent had been guilty of fraud, negligence, or other improper conduct, which would exonerate the insurers. I am not able to discern any misconduct on the part of the agent, that would exculpate the underwriters, and prevent their being responsible for a total loss. And indeed, this was a point proper for the decision of the jury, agreeably to the case of Mills v. Fletcher, in Doug. 230; and, therefore, the exception taken to the opinion of the court was not well-founded. The sloop could not be sold at private sale, and, by reason of the capture and recapture, she might have sustained consideraole damage. To sell the coffee, which constituted the cargo for Alexandria, to satisfy the salvage and costs, would have been an imprudent measure; for the redemption would have absorbed the whole proceeds, and then she would have returned to Alexandria without a cargo, as the captain had no funds to purchase one; and besides, she must have sailed without a register, which would have exposed her to great and unnecessary danger. Prudence dictated the sale as a safe step, and most for the benefit of the concerned.</p>
<p>The error set forth in the third bill of exception is, that the court below refused to instruct the jury, that the loss of the register, by means of the capture and recapture, was not sufficient, in law, to defeat the voyage from Kingston to Alexandria, and might have been supplied by special documents. Though the register did not impart any physical ability to the sloop, in regard to her sailing; yet, it was a document which tended to communicate safety, as it designated her character, individually and nationally. It is a necessary paper, and operates as a national passport; for, without it, she might be seized as an unauthorised rover on the ocean, and in certain cases, would have been liable to confiscation. The register is a document <span class="star-pagination">*397</span> of such a special and important nature, that its loss cannot be fully made up by other official papers. It would have been a very imprudent step for the captain to have proceeded on his voyage without a register; if he had, he would have been justly charged with improvidence, negligence, and culpable misconduct.</p>
<p>CUSHING, J. I consider this as clearly a case of intentional, not actual deviation; but not as a case of non-inception of the voyage insured.</p>
<p>This is proved by a number of cases cited; and contradicted by none.</p>
<p>What a case of non-inception is, is shown by the case of Wooldridge v. Boydell, Douglass, 16, where the ship was insured from Maryland to Cadiz, having no intention at all of going there; but that is totally different from the present case, where the vessel was cleared out at Jamaica for Alexandria, with a cargo taken in for Alexandria, and intended to go there.</p>
<p>It is true sugars were taken in for Baltimore, and the captain intended going there first. That amounts only to an intent to deviate; but no deviation unless executed.</p>
<p>This is proved by divers authorities. Middlewood and Blakes, 7 T.R. p. 162, B.R. a ship insured at and from London to Jamaica, and the captain had orders (exactly like the case at the bar) to touch at Cape Nicola Mole, to land stores, pursuant to charter-party. Upon which, one of the judges (Lawrence) gave an opinion, that if the vessel had been captured before she came to the dividing point, between the northern and southern courses to Jamaica, the insurers would have been liable.</p>
<p>And the other judges agreeing with judge Lawrence, to lay the whole stress of the cause in favour of the insurer, upon the captain's not exercising his judgment at the time, upon which was the best and safest of the three courses, (whose judgment the insurers had a right to have the benefit of) but taking the northern course, merely in pursuance of orders, to land stores at Cape Nicola Mole. All this shows, that had the captain exercised <span class="star-pagination">*398</span> his judgment in going the northern course, as being the best and safest, the whole court would have held the insurer liable, as the vessel was captured before she came to the dividing point, between the course to the Cape and to Jamaica.</p>
<p>Another case, more direct and decisive, is Foster v. Wilmer, 2 Str. 1248, 9, where the ship was insured from Carolina to Lisbon and to Bristol, and the captain took in salt to deliver at Falmouth, before going to Bristol, repugnant to the specification of the policy, yet being captured before arriving at the dividing point between Falmouth and Bristol, the insurer was held liable, which seems exactly the present case.</p>
<p>The mere taking in goods for another port, does not, of itself, make a deviation. It may, however, if it materially vary the risk, and be a circumstance designedly concealed and suppressed, excuse the underwriters. In the present case it does not appear, materially, to vary the risk, any more than in taking in stores to land at Cape Nicola Mole, in the case of Middlewood and Blakes, varied the risk, which was not suggested by court or counsel, that it did; or the taking in salt to land at Falmouth, in the case of Foster and Wilmer. It did not delay the voyage in the present case; the vessel sailed with convoy as soon as it was ready, and was afterwards captured in the proper course, before deviating.</p>
<p>The award may be laid out of the case, for more reasons than one. I think it void for uncertainty.</p>
<p>As to the loss, whether total or average, the jury, who had the whole evidence before them, have, in effect, found a total loss, and the voyage broken up. It is not certified by the court, that the bill of exceptions contains the whole evidence; and as strong circumstances (I think conclusive ones) are stated, that show the voyage could not be safely pursued, or could not be pursued at all, in consequence of the loss of register and loss of hands by the capture, either of which, it does not appear, could be supplied, I think we are not warranted to overrule the verdict, or reverse the judgment.</p>
<p>Judgment affirmed.</p>

<center><h1>EX PARTE BURFORD</h1></center>
<center><p><b>Supreme Court of United States.</b></p></center>
<center></center>
<p>Hiort, for the petitioner</p>
<p>MARSHALL, Ch. J.</p>
<p>There is some obscurity in the act of congress, and some doubts were entertained by the court as to the construction of the constitution. The court, however, in favour of liberty, was willing to grant the habeas corpus. But the case of the United States v. Hamilton, 3 Dal. 17, is decisive. It was there determined that this court could grant a habeas corpus; therefore, let the writ issue, returnable immediately, together with a certiorari, as prayed.</p>
<p>Upon the return of the habeas corpus, and certiorari, it appeared, that on the 28th of December, 1805, Burford was committed to the jail of Alexandria county, by a warrant under the hands and seals of Jonah Thompson, and ten other justices of the peace for that county; which warrant was in the following words:</p>
<p>Alexandria County, ss.</p>
<p>Whereas John A. Burford, of the county aforesaid, shopkeeper, has been brought before a meeting of many of the justices of the peace for the said county, and by them was required to find sufficient sureties to be bound <span class="star-pagination">*450</span> with him in a recognizance, himself in the sum of four thousand dollars, and securities for the like sum, for his good behaviour towards the citizens of the United States, and their property; and whereas the said John A. Burford hath failed or refused to find such sureties; these are therefore in the name of the United States, to command you the said constables, forthwith to convey the said John A. Burford to the common jail of the said county, and to deliver him to the keeper thereof, together with this precept; and we do, in the name of the said United States, hereby command you, the said keeper, to receive the said John A. Burford into your custody, in the said jail, and him there safely keep, until he shall find such sureties as aforesaid, or be otherwise discharged by due course of law. Given under our hands and seals, this 28th day of December, 1805.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>To any constable, and the jailor of the county of Alexandria.</h2>
<p>On the 4th of January, 1806, the circuit court of the district of Columbia, sitting in the county of Washington, upon the petition of Burford, granted a habeas corpus, and upon the return, the marshal certified, in addition to the above warrant of commitment, that Burford was apprehended by warrant, under the hands and seals of Jonah Thompson, and thirteen other justices of the county of Alexandria, a copy of which he certifies to be on file in his office, and is as follows:</p>
<p>Alexandria County, ss.</p>
<p>The undersigned justices of the United States, assigned to keep the peace within the said county, to the marshal of the district, and all and singular the constables, and other officers of the said county, Greeting:</p>
<p>Forasmuch as we are given to understand, from the information, testimony and complaint of many credible persons, that John A. Burford, of the said county, shop-keeper, is not of good name and fame, nor of honest conversation, but an evil doer and disturber of the <span class="star-pagination">*451</span> peace of the United States, so that murder, homicide, strifes, discords, and other grievances and damages, amongst the citizens of the United States, concerning their bodies and property, are likely to arise thereby, Therefore, on the behalf of the United States, we command you, and every of you, that you omit not, by reason of any liberty within the county aforesaid, but that you attach, or one of you do attach, the body of the aforesaid John A. Burford, so that you have him before us, or other justices of the said county, as soon as he can be taken, to find and offer sufficient surety and mainprize for his good behaviour towards the said United States, and the citizens thereof, according to the form of the statute in such case made and provided.</p>
<p>And this you shall in no wise omit, on the peril that shall ensue thereon, and have you before us this precept. Given under our hands and seals, in the county aforesaid, this 21st day of December, 1805.</p>
<p>The circuit court, upon hearing, remanded the prisoner to jail, there to remain until he should enter into a recognizance for his good behaviour for one year, himself in the sum of 1,000 dollars, and sureties in the like sum.</p>
<p>Hiort, for the prisoner, contended, that the commitment was illegal, both under the constitution of Virginia, and that of the United States. It does not state a cause certain, supported by oath.</p>
<p>By the 10th article of the bill of rights, of Virginia, it is declared, that all warrants to seize any person whose offence is not particularly described, and supported by evidence, are grievous and oppressive, and ought not to be granted.</p>
<p>By the 6th article of the amendments to the constitution of the United States, it is declared, "that on warrants shall issue but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation."</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*452</span> By the 8th article it is declared, that in all criminal prosecutions, the prisoner shall enjoy the right to be informed of the nature and cause of his accusation, and to be confronted with the witnesses against him; and the 10th article declares, that excessive bail shall not be required.</p>
<p>In the present case, the marshal's return, so far as it stated the warrant upon which Burford was arrested and carried before the justices, was perfectly immaterial. He did not complain of that arrest, but of his commitment to prison. The question is, what authority has the jailor to detain him? To ascertain this, we must look to the warrant of commitment only. It is that only which can justify his detention. That warrant states no offence. It does not allege that he was convicted of any crime. It states merely that he had been brought before a meeting of many justices, who had required him to find sureties for his good behaviour. It does not charge him of their own knowledge, or suspicion, or upon the oath of any person whomsoever.</p>
<p>It does not allege that witnesses were examined in his presence, or any other matter whatever, which can be the ground of their order to find sureties. If the charge against him was malicious, or grounded on perjury, whom could he sue for the malicious prosecution? or whom could he indict for perjury?</p>
<p>There ought to have been a conviction of his being a person of ill fame. The fact ought to have been established by testimony, and the names of the witnesses stated. Boscawen on Convictions, 7, 8, 10, 16, 110. Salk. 181.</p>
<p>But the order was oppressive, inasmuch as it required sureties in the enormous sum of 4,000 dollars, for his good behaviour for life.</p>
<p>If the prisoner had broken jail, it would have been no escape, for the marshal is not answerable, unless a cause certain be contained in the warrant, 2 Inst. 52, 53, and the reason given by Blackstone, 1 Com. 137, why <span class="star-pagination">*453</span> the warrant must state the cause of commitment, is, that it may be examined into upon habeas corpus. And in vol. 4, p. 256, speaking of the power of a justice to require sureties for good behaviour, he says, "But if he commits a man for want of sureties, he must express the cause thereof with convenient certainty, and take care that such cause be a good one. Rudyard's case, 2 Vent. 22.</p>
<p>Swann, on the same side, was informed by the court, that he need not say any thing as to the original commitment by the justices, but might confine his observations to the re-commitment by the circuit court, upon the habeas corpus.</p>
<p>He observed, that the circuit court did not reverse nor annul the original proceeding by the magistrates. It only diminished the sum in which bail should be required, and limited its duration to one year. It passed no new judgment, but merely remanded the prisoner Â— it heard no evidence Â— it was not a proceeding de novo Â— it gave no judgment Â— it convicted the prisoner of no offence. He is, therefore, still detained under the authority of the warrant of the justices; and if that is defective, there is no just cause of detainer. But if the remanding by the circuit court is to be considered as a new commitment, it is still a commitment upon the old ground; and if that was illegal, the order of the circuit court has not cured its illegality.</p>
<p>The Judges of this court were unanimously of opinion, that the warrant of commitment was illegal, for want of stating some good cause certain, supported by oath. If the circuit court had proceeded de novo, perhaps it might have made a difference. But this court is of opinion, that that court has gone only upon the proceedings before the justices. It has gone so far as to correct two of the errors committed, but the rest remain. If the prisoner is really a person of ill fame, and ought to find sureties for his good behaviour, the justices may proceed de novo, and take care that their proceedings are regular.</p>
<p>The prisoner is discharged.</p>

<p class="date">February Term, 1806</p>
<div class="num" id="p1">
<span class="num">1</span>
<p class="indent">THIS was a case <i>certified</i> from the circuit court for the fifth circuit, and Virginia district, in chancery sitting, in which the opinions of the judges (<i>Marshall, Ch. J.</i> and <i>Griffin, district judge</i>) were opposed upon the following question:</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p2">
<span class="num">2</span>
<p class="indent">'Whether the act of assembly of Virginia for the limitation of actions pleaded by the defendant was, under all the circumstances stated, a bar to the plaintiff's demand founded on a promissory note given on the 21st day of August, 1773?'</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p3">
<span class="num">3</span>
<p class="indent">The certificate contained the following statement of facts agreed by the parties, viz.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p4">
<span class="num">4</span>
<p class="indent">That David Bell, the defendant's testator, had considerable <i>dealings</i> with the mercantile house of Alexander Spiers, John Bowman &amp; Co. (of which house the plaintiff was surviving partner) in the then colony of Virginia, <i>by their factors who resided in that colony</i>, and on the 14th of March, 1768, gave his bond to the company for 633l. 8s. 11d. 1-2, conditioned for the payment of 316l. 14s. 5d. 3-4 on demand. That he also became farther indebted in a balance of 121l. Os. 4d. 1-2, an open account for dealings afterwards had with the company by their said factors. That on the 21st of August, 1773, Henry Bell, the defendant, made his writing, or promissory note, under his hand, attested by two witnesses, in the following words, to wit: 'I do hereby acknowledge myself to stand as security to Messrs. Alexander Spiers, John Bowman, &amp; Co. of Glasgow, for the sum of four hundred and thirty seven pounds, fourteen shillings and ten-pence, current money of Virginia, being a debt due them by my father, David Bell. Given under my hand, this twenty-first day of August, one thousand seven hundred and seventy-three. I am not to pay the above till it is convenient.' That the said Alexander Spiers, John Bowman, &amp; Co. were, at that time, British subjects, merchants, residents in Glasgow, in the kingdom of Great Britain, and have never been resident within the limits of the then colony, now state of Virginia, and that James Hopkirk, the surviving partner, now is, and always has been from the time of his birth, a British subject, resident in the kingdom of Great Britain, and was never within the limits of the commonwealth of Virginia. That the company had a factor or factors resident in the commonwealth of Virginia on the 21st of August, 1773, when the note was given, and from that time to the commencement of the American war, viz. on or about the first of September, 1776. That the company had neither agent or factor in this country, authorized to collect their debts, from the commencement of the war in 1776, until the year 1784. That on or about the 10th of September, 1784, and ever since, an agent has resided in this commonwealth, authorized by power of attorney, generally to collect all debts due to the company in this commonwealth.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p5">
<span class="num">5</span>
<p class="indent">That by the fourth article of the definitive treaty of peace, between the United States and his Britannic majesty, made on the third of September, 1782, 'it is agreed, that creditors on either side, shall meet with no lawful impediment to the recovery of the full value, in sterling money, of all <i>bona fide</i> debts heretofore contracted.' And by the second article of the convention between his Britannic Majesty and the United States, made on the 8th of January, 1802, 'the said fourth article,' (of the treaty of peace) 'so far as respects its future operation, is recognised, confirmed, and declared to be binding and obligatory,' 'and the same shall be accordingly observed with punctuality and good faith, and so as that the said creditors shall hereafter meet with no lawful impediment to the recovery of the full value in sterling money, of their <i>bona fide</i> debts.'</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p6">
<span class="num">6</span>
<p class="indent">That by the acts of the Virginia assembly, passed on the ________ and the practice of the courts, British creditors, their agents, and factors, were prevented from suing with effect for their debts in the courts of this commonwealth, from the ____ day of April, 1774, until the year 1790â€”and that this suit was commenced on the 4th of Jan. 1803.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p7">
<span class="num">7</span>
<p class="indent">By the fourth section of the Virginia act of limitations, <i>p. p.</i> 107, actions upon the case on accounts are to be brought within five years after cause of action. By the twelfth section there is a saving of persons <i>beyond seas;</i> but by the thirteenth section it is provided, 'that all suits hereafter brought in the name or names of any person or persons residing beyond the seas, or out of this country, for the recovery of any debt due for goods <i>actually sold and delivered here, by his or their factor or factors</i>, shall be commenced and prosecuted within the time appointed and limited by this act for bringing the like suits, and not after, notwithstanding the saving herein before contained, to persons beyond the seas at the times their causes of action accrued.'</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p8">
<span class="num">8</span>
<p class="indent"><i>C. Lee</i>, for the plaintiff. The question is, whether the act of limitations, which had once begun to run, was an impediment removed by the treaty?</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p9">
<span class="num">9</span>
<p class="indent">This raises another question; did the treaty of peace repeal the laws of the several states which operated as legal impediments to the recovery of British debts, or was an act of each state necessary for that purpose?</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p10">
<span class="num">10</span>
<p class="indent">It may be conceded without injury to this case, that the act of limitations began to run against this claim before the warâ€”and that the <i>war</i> did not suspend its operation, but that it continued to run in the same manner as against a person who is in the country at the time the cause of action accrues, and who goes beyond seas before the limitation is completeâ€”or against a woman who was sole when the cause of action accrued, and who married within the five years.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p11">
<span class="num">11</span>
<p class="indent">The plea of limitations can defeat the remedy only. The debt remains. But if the bar had been complete, yet it was forever removed by the treaty. This was a <i>bona fide</i> debt, contracted before the treatyâ€”and the act of limitations is a legal impediment which it is endeavoured to oppose to its recovery. But the treaty says that the creditor shall meet with no legal impediment; and the constitution of the United States declares the treaty to be the <i>supreme</i> law of the land.â€”The act of limitations, therefore, must yield to the treaty.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p12">
<span class="num">12</span>
<p class="indent">In the case of <i>Ware</i> v. <i>Hylton</i>, 3 <i>Dal.</i> 199, this court, upon very solemn argument decided, that the treaty not only repealed all the state laws which operated as impediments, but nullified all acts done, and all rights acquired, under such laws, which tended to obstruct the creditor's right of recovery.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p13">
<span class="num">13</span>
<p class="indent">Similar adjudications were also made in the cases of <i>Hamilton</i> v. <i>Eaton</i>, in 1796, by <i>Ch. J. Ellsworth</i> and <i>Judge Sitgreaves</i>, in North Carolina. <i>Page</i> v. <i>Pendleton</i>, in 1793, by Chancellor Wythe, <i>Wythe's Reports</i>, 127; and by this court in <i>The State of Georgia</i> v. <i>Brailsford</i>, 3 <i>Dal.</i> 1.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p14">
<span class="num">14</span>
<p class="indent">The second article of the convention of 1802, between the United States and Great Britain, <i>Laws U. S. vol.</i> 6, <i>Appendix</i> 49, was produced by the difference of opinion at the board of commissioners for carrying into effect the sixth article of the treaty of 1794. The ideas of the United States, as to the effect of the treaty in removing all impediments arising from legislative acts, are expressed in the answer to <i>Cunningham's</i> claim, in page 51 of the printed report of the proceedings of the board.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p15">
<span class="num">15</span>
<p class="indent">The basis of the convention was the American construction of the sixth article of the treaty of 1794. A sum of 600,000l. sterling was stipulated to be paid by the United States for all losses under the sixth article of the treaty of 1794, and the creditors were to recover from their debtors whatever they could in the ordinary course of justice; all legislative impediments having been removed by the treaty of peace, which is recognised and confirmed by the convention.</p>

<div class="num" id="p17">
<span class="num">17</span>
<p class="indent">Upon the question, in this case referred to this court from the circuit court: it is considered by this court, that the said act of limitations is not a bar to the plaintiff's demand on the said note; and this court is of opinion, that the length of time from the giving the note to the commencement of the war, in 1775, not being sufficient to bar the demand on the said note, according to the said act of assembly, the treaty of peace between Great Britain and the United States of 1783, does not admit of adding the time previous to the war, to any time subsequent to the treaty, in order to make a bar: and is also of opinion, that the agent merely for collecting debts, mentioned and described in the said state of facts, is not to be considered as a <i>factor</i> within the meaning of the said act of assembly, so as to bring the case within the proviso of said act.</p>

<p class="indent">ERROR to the circuit court of the district of Columbia.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p2">
<span class="num">2</span>
<p class="indent">This was an action of <i>assumpsit</i>, brought by <i>Mason</i>, against <i>Lawrason</i>, surviving partner of the firm of <i>Lawrason &amp; Smoot</i>, upon the following note: 'Alexandria, 28th November, 1800.</p>

</div>
<div class="num" id="p7">
<span class="num">7</span>
<p class="indent">The declaration contained several counts, laying the <i>assumpsit</i> in different forms, but the substance of each was, that the plaintiff, relying on and placing confidence in the promise of the defendants, and at their instance and request, sold and delivered the corn to M'Pherson, at the price of three dollars a barrel, who, although requested, never paid the plaintiff therefor, of which the defendants had notice, whereby the defendants became liable, and, in consideration thereof, promised to pay. The defendants pleaded the general issue, and at the trial a verdict was taken for the plaintiff, subject to the opinion of the court upon a demurrer to evidence, which stated, in substance, that the defendants signed and delivered the said note to M'Phersonâ€”that he applied to the agent of the plaintiff for the corn, and offered three dollars a barrel, payable in twelve months that the agent consulted the plaintiff, who agreed that M'Pherson should have the corn on those terms, if he would give security that M'Pherson then offered as his security, Lawrason &amp; Smoot. The agent agreed to take them, if they would give their assumption in writing. In a few days afterwards, M'Pherson sent to the agent the said note of Lawrason &amp; Smoot. Before the corn was delivered, the agent informed the plaintiff what had passed between himself and M'Pherson, relative to the corn, and also showed him the note, and asked him whether it would do; to which he replied, he supposed it would. But they called upon Lawrason, and asked him if he was content to be M'Pherson's security for this corn. He hesitated at first, but said he <i>must be so</i>, as he had promised; or, as his word was out, <i>he would;</i> or words to that effect: whereupon the plaintiff suffered M'Pherson to take the corn, at the price of three dollars per barrel, which he agreed to give. That there was another debt due to the plaintiff from M'Pherson, about the 1st of January, 1801, which he was unable to pay.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p8">
<span class="num">8</span>
<p class="indent">That about the 1st of January, 1800, M'Pherson gave his promissory note for the amount due for the corn, payable to Lawrason &amp; Smoot, with intent that they should indorse it, but, upon its being presented to Smoot, he refused, saying, that M'Pherson had failed to furnish them with meal, which he had agreed to deliver to them for their indorsement; he therefore would not become security; but upon being shown the note of 28th of November, he acknowledged that it had been given by them.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p9">
<span class="num">9</span>
<p class="indent">The plaintiff also produced the certificate of discharge of M'Pherson, under the bankrupt law, dated the 15th of September, 1802, and proved by witnesses that he became insolvent in the year 1800.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p10">

<p class="indent"><i>Swann</i>, for plaintiff in error. The promise in this case was not made to the plaintiff; and no action can be maintained against a person who is a stranger to the consideration, and who is not a party to the agreement, <i>Cro. El.</i> 369, <i>Jordan</i> v. <i>Jordan. Esp. N. P.</i> 105, 106. Perhaps an action might lay for the deceit, but not upon the <i>assumpsit</i>. The will of both parties must concur at the same moment. If I make an offer of goods at a certain price, and give time to the other party to consider of it, and within the time the other party agrees to the terms, I am not bound to comply. There was no consideration, and consequently no contract, 3 <i>T. R.</i> 653, <i>Cooke</i> v. <i>Oxley</i>.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p12">
<span class="num">12</span>
<p class="indent">Besides, it does not appear that the money was ever demanded of M'Pherson; and, until he had refused to pay, no right of action could accrue against the defendant.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>C. Lee</i>, contra. There is an essential difference between common contracts and <i>a letter of credit</i>. The latter is a mercantile instrument, bottomed upon the principle of <i>good faith</i>. It is a promise to him who will give credit to the third person, and the consideration is the actual delivery of the money or goods to the third person, <i>upon the faith</i> of the letter of credit. This is, therefore, a promise to the plaintiff, and a good consideration is raised by the delivery of the corn upon the faith of the defendant's note in writing.

</div>
<div class="num" id="p16">
<span class="num">16</span>
<p class="indent">This action is grounded upon a note in writing, which was certainly intended by the defendants to give a credit to M'Pherson. They are bound by every principle of moral rectitude and good faith to fulfil those expectations which they thus raised, and which induced the plaintiff to part with his property. The evidence was clear that the credit was given upon the faith of the letter.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p17">
<span class="num">17</span>
<p class="indent">Unless, therefore, there is some plain and positive rule of law against it, the action ought to be supported.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p18">
<span class="num">18</span>
<p class="indent">In the case cited from <i>Espinasse</i>, the rule is laid down too broadly. If compared with analagous cases, it will be found to be considerably modified.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p19">

<p class="indent">Thus, if money be delivered by <i>A.</i> to <i>B.</i> to be paid over to <i>C.</i> although no promise is made by <i>B.</i> to <i>C.</i> yet <i>C.</i> may recover the money from <i>B.</i> by an action of <i>assumpsit</i>.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p20">
<span class="num">20</span>
<p class="indent">If it be said that in such a case the law raises the <i>assumpsit</i> from the facts, and if the facts do not imply an <i>assumpsit</i>, no action will lay;â€”it may be answered, that in the present case there is an <i>actual assumpsit</i> to all the world, and any person who trusts, in consequence of that promise, has a right of action.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p21">
<span class="num">21</span>
<p class="indent">It has been suggested by the counsel for the defendants, that, although an action of <i>assumpsit</i> will not lay, yet possibly the plaintiff might support an action for the <i>deceit</i>. But an action for the deceit must be grounded upon the breach of the promise. And if an action will lay in any form, the present seems to be at least as proper as any other.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Thomas Knox</i>, administrator, with the will annexed, of <i>Raapzat Heyleger</i>, a subject of the king of <i>Denmark</i>, brought an action of trespass <i>vi et armis</i>, in the supreme court of judicature, of the state of New-York, against <i>Joshua Sands</i>, collector of the customs for the port of New-York, for seizing and detaining a schooner called the Jennett, with her cargo. The defendant, <i>Sands</i>, pleaded in justification, that he was collector, &amp;c. and that after the 1st day of July, 1798, viz. on the 16th of November, 1798, the said schooner, then being called <i>The Juno</i>, was owned by a person resident within the United States, at Middletown, in Connecticut, and cleared for a foreign voyage, viz. from Middletown to the island of <i>St. Croix</i>, a bond being given to the use of the United States, as directed by the statute, with condition that the vessel should not, during her intended voyage, or before her return within the United States, proceed, or be carried, directly or indirectly, to any port or place within the territory of the French republic, or the dependencies thereof, or any place in the West-Indies, or elsewhere, under the acknowledged government of France, unless by stress of weather, or want of provisions, or by actual force or violence, to be fully proved and manifested before the acquittance of such bond, and that such vessel was not, and should not be employed during her said intended voyage, or before her return as aforesaid, in any traffic or commerce, with, or for any person resident within the territory of that republic, or in any of the dependencies thereof. That afterwards, on the 8th of December, 1798, she did proceed, and was voluntarily carried from Middletown to the island of <i>St. Croix</i>, in the West-Indies, and from thence, before her return within the United States, to <i>Port de Paix</i>, in the island of <i>St. Domingo</i>, being then a place under the acknowledged government of France, without being obliged to do so by stress of weather, or want of provisions, or actual force and violence, whereby, and according to the form of the statute, the said schooner and her cargo became forfeited, the one half to the use of the United States, and the other half to the informer; by reason whereof, the defendant, being collector, &amp;c. on the 1st of July, 1799, arrested, entered, and took possession of the said vessel and cargo, for the use of the United States, and detained them as mentioned in the declaration, and as it was lawful for him to do.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p3">

<p class="indent">The plaintiff, in his replication, admitted that the defendant was collector, &amp;c. that at the time she sailed from Middletown for <i>St. Croix</i>, she was owned by a person then resident in the United States; and that a bond was given as stated in the plea; but alleged, that she sailed directly from Middletown to <i>St. Croix</i>, where she arrived on the 1st of February, 1799, the said island of St. Croix, then and yet being under the government of the king of Denmark. That one <i>Josiah Savage</i>, then and there being the owner and possessor of the said vessel, sold her, for a valuable consideration, at <i>St. Croix</i>, to the said <i>Raapzat Heyleger</i>, who was then, and until his death continued to be, a subject of the king of Denmark, and resident at St. Croix, who, on the 1st of March following, sent the said vessel, on his own account, and for his own benefit, on a voyage from <i>Port de Paix</i> to <i>St. Croix, Without that</i>, that she was at any other time carried, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="indent">The only question which could be made in this court, was upon the construction of the act of congress, of <i>June</i> 13th, 1798, <i>vol.</i> 4 <i>p.</i> 129, commonly called <i>the non-intercourse act;</i> the 1st section of which is in these words: 'That no ship or vessel, owned, hired, or employed, wholly or in part, by any person resident within the United States, and which shall depart therefrom after the 1st day of July next, shall be allowed to proceed directly, or from any intermediate port or place, to any port or place within the territory of the French republic, or the dependencies thereof, or to any place in the West-Indies, or elsewhere, under the acknowledged government of France, or shall be employed in any traffic or commerce with or for any person, resident within the jurisdiction, or under the authority of the French republic. And if any ship or vessel, in any voyage thereafter commencing, and before her return within the United States, shall be voluntarily carried, or suffered to proceed to any French port or place, as aforesaid, or shall be employed as aforesaid, contrary to the intent hereof, every such ship or vessel, together with her cargo, shall be forfeited, and shall accrue, the one half to the use of the United States, and the other half to the use of any person or persons, citizens of the United States, who will inform and prosecute for the same; and shall be liable to be seized, prosecuted, and condemned, in any circuit or district court of the United States, which shall be holden within and for the district where the seizure shall be made.'</p>

<p class="indent">The question is, whether the act of congress does not impose a disability upon the vessel itself?</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p11">
<span class="num">11</span>
<p class="indent">This vessel was clearly within the literal prohibition of the act. She was 'owned wholly by a person resident within the United States.' She did 'depart therefrom after the 1st day of July (then) next.' She did 'proceed from an intermediate port or place, to a place in the West-Indies, under the acknowledged government of France.' She was also a vessel which, 'in a voyage thereafter commencing, and before her return within the United States,' was 'voluntarily carried, or suffered to proceed, to a French port.' She had, therefore, done and suffered every act, which, according to the letter of the law, rendered her liable to forfeiture, seizure, and condemnation.</p>

<p class="indent">It is true, that the decision of this court, in the case of the Charming Betsey, <i>ante, vol.</i> 2, <i>p.</i> 115, seems at first view to be against us. But the present question was not made, and could not arise in that case, because that vessel had not been to a French port, nor had she returned from a French port to the United States. If such a trade as the present case presents, were to be permitted, the whole object of the <i>non-intercourse</i> act would be frustrated. A vessel of the United States may, according to the judgment in the case of the Charming Betsey, the sold and transferred to a Dane, and he may trade with her as he pleases; but we say it is with this proviso, tht he does not send her from a French port to the United States. He takes the vessel with that restriction. If he trades to the United States, he is bound to know and respect their laws. The intention of the law was not only to prevent American <i>citizens</i>, but American <i>vessels</i>, from carrying on an intercourse with French ports.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p13">
<span class="num">13</span>
<p class="indent">The case of the Charming Betsey was under the act of February, 1800; but the present case arises under that of 1798, which is very different in many respects. The opinion in that case, so far as it was not upon points necessarily before the court, is open to examination.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p14">
<span class="num">14</span>
<p class="indent">Neither the words of the law, nor the form of the bond, make any exception of the case of the sale and transfer of the vessel before her return. If therefore a sale is made it must be subject to the terms of the law; and although the vessel may not be liable to seizure upon the high seas, yet upon her return to the United States, it became the duty of the custom-house officer to seize her. The law ought to be so construed as to carry into effect the object intended. That object was, to cut off all intercourse with France, and by that means compel her to do justice to the United States. But if this provision of the law is to be so easily eluded, France will be in a better situation than before, for she will receive her usual supplies and we shall be weakened by the loss of the carrying trade.</p>

WARE.</h1></center>
<center><p><b>Supreme Court of United States.</b></p></center>
<center></center>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*504</span> C. Lee, for the appellant.</p>
<p>P.B. Key, contra.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*509</span> JOHNSON, J.</p>
<p>I found my opinion in this case upon a single consideration. It was incumbent on the appellant to show that Evans' neglecting to comply with his promise to insure, made Farrel &amp; Jones liable. I think it did not, because it appears that Farrel &amp; Jones did not generally hold themselves bound to insure shipments of tobacco, without receiving express instructions to do so. It was, therefore, incumbent upon the executors of Randolph to communicate such instructions to Farrel &amp; Jones. If they confided in the promise of Evans to give these instructions, it was to their own prejudice. And although the failure of Evans to do so, certainly made him personally liable to them, yet it could not produce a liability in Farrel &amp; Jones. So far as Evans was entrusted to do an act incumbent on the appellant's testator himself to do, he was the agent of the executors of Randolph, and not of Farrel &amp; Jones.</p>
<p>WASHINGTON, J. In this case it appears that a letter was written by Farrel &amp; Jones, in August, 1770, notifying the executors of Randolph, that they would not make insurance without orders. And it is shown also, that the Randolphs were accustomed to give orders for insurance whenever they wished to have it made. Whatever then may be the general usage of the trade, it will not apply to the present case.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*510</span> The deposition of Grymes comes in a very questionable shape. It speaks of things 30 years ago, and in very uncertain language. But admitting for a moment that it applies to this shipment, Evans had not authority to bind his principal by a promise to insure. He did not promise for them, but promised for himself, that he would write to them to make insurance. This, it is admitted, he did not do. Are Farrel &amp; Jones liable for his personal engagement?</p>
<p>But the deposition of Grymes is not only uncorroborated, but opposed by the other evidence in the cause. If the Randolphs relied upon this supposed engagement of Evans, why did they give their bond in 1772, nine months after the loss, and long after they had notice of the loss, for the balance of the account, without demanding a credit for the lost tobacco? Three accounts current were sent them for the years 1772, 1773 and 1774, at several times, and they were requested at each time to examine them, and, if they contained any error, to advise Farrel &amp; Jones of it. By not doing this, they have given strong evidence that there was no such agreement with Evans, that there was no error in the accounts, and that Mr. Grymes must have been mistaken, or that his deposition refers to some other transaction.</p>
<p>PATERSON, J. The complainant filed a cross bill to obtain credit for 50 hogsheads of tobacco, which were shipped on board the Planter, the 17th September, 1771, by Richard and Peyton Randolph, executors of Wm. Randolph, and consigned to Farrel &amp; Jones, merchants, at Bristol, in England. The tobacco was not insured. The Planter foundered at sea, and the tobacco was lost. The question is, who shall sustain the loss? It is contended, on the part of the representatives of the Randolphs, that Farrel &amp; Jones ought to have insured the tobacco, and not having done so, they have made themselves liable to the amount, as if it had been insured. To establish this position, the counsel for the complainan has taken the following grounds.</p>
<p>1st. From the nature and usage of the trade between the Virginia planter and the English merchant, it was <span class="star-pagination">*511</span> the duty of the latter to have insured the tobacco, and failing so to do, he is responsible as the insurer.</p>
<p>2d. That Thomas Evans, the agent of Farrel &amp; Jones, having promised to have insurance made, it is equivalent to the promise of his principals, Farrel &amp; Jones, and they are responsible for the consequences.</p>
<p>As to the first point, no usage has been proved. And if an usage did exist, this case was taken out of it; as it appears by the whole course of correspondence between the parties, that Farrell &amp; Jones never did insure tobacco without orders; and that the Randolphs gave them orders to effect insurances on tobacco, whenever they thought it expedient or necessary.</p>
<p>Great stress is laid on the contract, which it is stated was entered into between the Randolphs and Thomas Evans, the agent of Farrel &amp; Jones. The contract is founded on the deposition of Philip Grymes. This deposition is certainly open to the strictures which have been made upon it by the counsel on the part of the defendant. It does not appear when, and before whom, the deposition was taken. The deposition is ex parte, for neither the defendant or his attorney had an opportunity to cross-examine the witness. If it was taken at or about the time that the bill was filed, then it is liable to the objections resulting from the frailty and uncertainty of memory, and the misconception or misconstruction of words used in a general conversation, after a long period of time, exceeding twenty years. Besides, the quantity of tobacco to be insured was not mentioned in the course of the conversation, nor does it appear, that it was at any time afterwards communicated to the agent; and unless the quantity was ascertained, an insurance could not be effected. How this paper, purporting to be a deposition, became annexed to the bill, I have not been able to discover from the proceedings; and if it be admitted as a piece of evidence in the cause, its credit is much impaired in consequence of the observations already made.</p>
<p>The acts of the agent bind the principal; and supposing Evans to have been the general agent of Farrel <span class="star-pagination">*512</span> &amp; Jones, it may well be questioned, whether his undertaking to insure, is obligatory upon them; as it is manifest, from the correspondence between the Randolphs and Farrel &amp; Jones, that the latter did not insure tobacco without express orders for that purpose; that the Randolphs wrote to them to insure, when they deemed an insurance proper. The fair inference is, that if Evans engaged to have an insurance made in this instance by Farrel &amp; Jones, it was a personal contract on his part, which bound himself and no other, and for the performance of which he was responsible in his private character. Orders for insurance were invariably transmitted by the Randolphs to Farrel &amp; Jones, and not communicated to them through the medium of Evans, unless the present should be considered as an exception. Under such circumstances, the Randolphs, if they relied on the promise of Evans, must look to him individually, and not through him to Farrel &amp; Jones. By this promise, Evans bound himself, and not the firm.</p>
<p>The house of Farrel &amp; Jones transmitted annually their accounts to the Randolphs; they did so for the year 1771, after the loss of the tobacco, which it is admitted was not passed to the credit of the Randolphs. The bond given for the balance is dated the 1st January, 1772, though, from the letter of the 4th April, 1772, it was not, probably, executed till some months after its date. It was made to bear date the 1st January, 1772, that it might correspond with the accounts rendered, and carry interest from that period. Farrel &amp; Jones annually rendered regular and stated accounts to the Randolphs of their mutual dealings in the years 1772, 1773, and 1774; and in a letter of the former to the latter, Farrel &amp; Jones particularly requested, that errors, if any occurred, should be pointed out, that they might be rectified. But the Randolphs made no objections Â— they made no mention of the tobacco which was lost, nor did they ever intimate an opinion, that Farrel &amp; Jones were liable for its amount. Why this silence, this acquiescence? The period of the war we will let pass without animadversion, as no dealings or communication took place between the parties. Evans died in 1778. In 1780 Hanson was appointed the agent of Farrel &amp; Jones. It was never suggested to Hanson, that the Randolphs, <span class="star-pagination">*513</span> or their representatives, claimed an allowance for the tobacco; no intention was manifested to charge Farrel and Jones with it, until an action was commenced on the bond, in 1793, or 1794, when, for the first time, a claim was set up for the tobacco. Mr. Lee has endeavoured to account for this silence and acquiescence, but not in a satisfactory manner; and it is probable that the Randolphs never thought of making any demand, because they were convinced that they had no right to do so, and that they must sustain the loss themselves, as they had neglected to order Farrel and Jones to make the insurance. It was a loss justly imputable to their own neglect or imprudence; or if not, then they intended to stand their own insurers.</p>
<p>Farrel and Jones expressed regret whenever they received no orders to insure; and this flowed from the nature and situation of their accounts and dealings: for as the Randolphs were indebted to the firm, in a large amount, it became the interest of Farrel and Jones, that the tobacco should be insured, as it was property intended to be appropriated towards the payment of the debt due to them. The loss rendered the Randolphs the less able to pay, and increased the risk of Farrel and Jones, by diminishing their security. An insurance, therefore, of the property of the debtor, must have been beneficial and satisfactory to the creditor. But this insurance, it seems, the house of Farrel and Jones never thought themselves authorised to make, unless they received immediately from the Randolphs explicit directions for the purpose.</p>
<p>The charge is stale. The claim comes too late; it is brought forward after a sleep of near 30 years, during which period the original parties and their agents have disappeared and are no more. An acquiescence for such a length of time, and under such circumstances, is too stubborn and inveterate to be surmounted. The claim was put into oblivion; and there it ought to have remained. A court of equity should not interpose in a case of this kind; and, therefore, the decree pronounced by the circuit court ought to be affirmed.</p>

<p>THIS case was certified from the circuit court of the district of Pennsylvania, upon a division of opinion between the judges of that court, upon the question whether certain articles of copper, viz. round copper bars, round copper plates, and round copper plates turned up at the edges, imported by the defendants, were subject to duty, within the meaning of the acts of congress; viz. 20th July, 1789 Â— and 10th of August, 1790, vol. 1. p. 251. Â§ 1. by which "copper in plates" is exempt from duty, and the act of the 2d of May, 1792, vol. 2. p. 71. Â§ 2. by which "copper in pigs and bars" is also exempt from duty.</p>
<p>The jury found a special verdict, the substance of which was, that such articles as those in question, are of no use in the form in which they are imported, but are worked up as a raw material. That the round, the square and the flat bars are, by the manufacturers and artists, known by the denomination of "bars." That all the articles are sold by weight, and the same price is paid for round as for square or flat bars; and for round plates, and round plates turned up at the edges, as for square or oblong plates. "And that all the aforesaid <span class="star-pagination">*2</span> articles come under the description of bars and plates."</p>

<p><span class="star-pagination">*9</span> E. Tilghman, for appellant.</p>
<p>Hare, contra.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*20</span> MARSHALL, Ch. J. delivered the opinion of the court.</p>
<p>The privateer Addition, cruising under a commission granted by the congress of these United States during the war between this country and Great Britain, captured the sloop George, brought her into port, and libelled her in the court of admiralty for the state of New-Jersey, where she was condemned as lawful prize by a sentence rendered on the 31st of October, 1778, and ordered to be sold by the marshal. From this sentence Richard D. Jennings, the owner, prayed an appeal, which, on the 23d of December, 1780, came on to be heard before the court of appeals constituted by congress, when the sentence of the court of Jersey was reversed, and restitution of the vessel and cargo was awarded. Pending the appeal, on the 13th of November, 1778, the order of sale <span class="star-pagination">*21</span> was executed, and the proceeds of sale remained in possession of the marshal. It does not appear that any application was ever made to the court of New-Jersey to have execution of the decree of the court of appeals, and this suit is brought to carry it into execution, or on some other principle to recover from the estate of Joseph Carson, who was part owner of the privateer Addition, the value of the George and her cargo.</p>
<p>So far as this bill seeks to carry into effect the decree of the 23d of December, 1780, there is no doubt of the jurisdiction of the court; but the relief granted can only be commensurate with that decree. It is therefore all essential to the merits of this cause to inquire how far Joseph Carson, the testator of the defendants, was bound by the sentence which this court is asked to carry into effect.</p>
<p>The words under which the plaintiffs claim are those which direct the restoration of the George and her cargo. As the captors are not ordered by name to effect this restoration, and as the order bound those in possession of the subject on which it must be construed to operate, it must be considered as affecting those who could obey it, not those who were not in possession of the thing to be restored, had no power over it, and were, consequently, unable to redeliver it. Had Richard D. Jennings appeared before the court of New-Jersey with this decree in his hand, and demanded its execution, the process of that court would have been directed to those who possessed the thing to be restored, not to those who held no power over it, either in point of fact or law.</p>
<p>This position appears too plain to require the aid of precedent, but if such aid should be looked for, the case of Doane v. Penhallow unquestionably affords it. In that case a decree of reversal and restitution was satisfied by directing the proceeds of the sales to be paid; and even the judge who tried the cause at the circuit concurred with his brethren in reversing his own judgment, so far as it had decreed joint damages, and had thereby rendered the defendant liable for more than he had received. The case of Doane v. Penhallow, therefore, which must be considered as expounding the decree <span class="star-pagination">*22</span> of the court of appeals now under consideration, has decided that Joseph Carson was bound to effect restitution by that decree so far only as he was, either in law or in fact, possessed of the George and her cargo, or of the proceeds.</p>
<p>To this point, therefore, the inquiries of the court will be directed.</p>
<p>In prosecuting them it will be necessary to ascertain whether,</p>
<p>1st. The George and her cargo were, previous to the sentence, in the custody of the law, or of the captors.</p>
<p>2d. Whether the court of admiralty, after an appeal from their sentence, possessed the power to sell the vessel and cargo, and to hold the proceeds for the benefit of those having the right.</p>
<p>It appears that the court of New-Jersey, which condemned the George and her cargo as prize, was established in pursuance of the recommendation of congress, and that no legislative act had prescribed its practice or defined its powers. The act produced in court was passed at a subsequent period, and consequently cannot govern the case. But the court cannot admit the correctness of the argument drawn from this act by the counsel for the plaintiffs in error. It cannot be admitted that an act defining the powers and regulating the practice of a pre-existing court, contains provisions altogether new. The reverse of this proposition is generally true. Such an act may rather be expected to be confirmatory of the practice and of the powers really exercised.</p>
<p>Since we find a court instituted and proceeding to act as a court, without a law defining its practice or its powers, we must suppose it to have exercised its powers in such mode as is employed by other courts instituted for the object, and as is consonant to the general principles on which it must act.</p>
<p>That by the practice of courts of admiralty a vessel when libelled is placed under the absolute controul of the <span class="star-pagination">*23</span> court, is not controverted; but the plaintiffs contend that this power over the subject is not inherent in a court of admiralty, but is given by statute, and in support of this opinion the prize acts of Great Britain have been referred to, which unquestionably contain regulations on this point. But the court is not of opinion that those acts confer entirely new powers on the courts whose practice they regulate. In Browne's Civil and Admiralty Law, in his chapter on the jurisdiction of the prize courts, it is expressly stated that those courts exercised their jurisdiction anterior to the prize acts, and the same opinion is expressed by Lord Mansfield, in the case of Lindo v. Rodney, which is cited by Browne. The prize acts, therefore, most probably regulated pre-existing powers in the manner best adapted to the actual circumstances of the time.</p>
<p>It is conceived that the constitution and character of a court of admiralty, and the object it is to effect, will throw much light on this subject.</p>
<p>The proceedings of that court are in rem, and their sentences act on the thing itself. They decide who has the right, and they order its delivery to the party having the right. The libellant and the claimant are both actors. They both demand from the court the thing in contest. It would be repugnant to the principles of justice and to the practice of courts to leave the thing in possession of either of the parties, without security, while the contest is depending. If the practice of a court of admiralty should not place the thing in the custody of its officers, it would be essential to justice that security should be demanded of the libellant to have it forthcoming to answer the order of the court.</p>
<p>If the captor should fail to libel the captured vessel, it has been truly stated in argument that the owner may claim her in the court of admiralty. How excessively defective would be the practice of that court, if, on receiving such a claim, it neither took possession of the vessel, nor required security that its sentence should be performed. Between the rights of a claimant where a libel is filed and where it is not filed, no distinction is perceived, <span class="star-pagination">*24</span> and the court conceives the necessary result of proceedings in rem to be that the thing in litigation must be placed in the custody of the law, and cannot be delivered to either party but on sufficient security.</p>
<p>In conformity with this opinion is the practice of the court of admiralty, not only when sitting for the trial of prizes, and acting in conformity with the directions of positive law, but when sitting as an instance court, and conforming to the original principles of a court of admiralty. In his chapter "on the practice of the instance court," under the title of "proceedings in rem," p. 397. Browne states explicitly, that when the proceeding is against a ship, the process commences with a warrant directing the arrest of the ship. In Browne, 405. the course of proceedings against a ship, not for a debt, but to obtain possession, is stated at length, and in that case too the court takes possession of the ship.</p>
<p>It must be supposed that a court of admiralty, having prize jurisdiction, and consequently proceeding in rem, and not having its practice precisely regulated by law, would conform to those principles which usually govern courts proceeding in rem, and which seem necessarily to belong to the proper exercise of their functions. If in proceeding against a ship to subject her to the payment of a debt, or to acquire the possession of her on account of title, the regular course is that the court takes the vessel into custody and holds her for the party having right, the conclusion seems irresistible, that in proceeding against a ship to condemn her as prize to the captor, or to restore her to the owner who has been ousted of his possession, the court will also take the vessel into custody, and hold her for the party having the right.</p>
<p>This reasoning is illustrated, and its correctness in a great measure confirmed, by the legislation of the United States, and the judicial proceedings of our own country. By the judicial act the district courts are also courts of admiralty, and no law has regulated their practice. Yet they proceed according to the general rules of the admiralty, and a vessel libelled is always in possession of the law.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*25</span> An objection, however, to the application of this reasoning to the case before the court is drawn from the defectiveness of the record in the original cause, which does not exhibit a warrant to the officer to arrest the George. The first step which appears to have been taken by the court is an order to the marshal to summon a jury for the trial of the case.</p>
<p>The carelessness with which the papers of a court created for the purposes of the war, and which ceased to exist before the institution of this suit, have been kept, may perhaps account for this circumstance. At any rate the court of admiralty must be presumed to have done its duty, and to have been in possession of the thing in contest, if its duty required that possession. The proceedings furnish reasons for considering this as the fact.</p>
<p>The libel does not state the George to have remained in possession of the captors, that the sale was made for them, or by their means, nor that the proceeds came to their hands. The answer of the defendants avers that on bringing the George into port, she was delivered up with all her papers to the court of admiralty, and, although the answer is not testimony in this respect, yet the nature of the transaction furnishes ample reason to believe that this was the fact; and it is the duty of the plaintiff to show that the defendants are in a situation to be liable to his claim. If the process of the court of admiralty does not appear regular, this court, not sitting to reverse or affirm their judgment, but to carry a decree of reversal and restoration into effect, must suppose the property to be in the hands of those in whom the law places it, unless the contrary appears. The George and her cargo, therefore, must be considered as being in custody of the law, unless the contrary appears.</p>
<p>If this conclusion be right, it follows that the regularity of the sale is a question of no importance to the defendants, since that sale was the act of a court having legal possession of the thing, and acting on its own authority.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*26</span> If the reasoning be incorrect, it then becomes necessary to inquire,</p>
<p>2d. Whether the court of New-Jersey, after an appeal from its sentence, possessed the power of selling the George and her cargo, and holding the proceeds for the party having the right.</p>
<p>That the British courts possess this power is admitted, but the plaintiffs contend that it is conferred by statute, and is not incident to a prize court.</p>
<p>That the power exists while the cause is depending in court seems not to be denied, and indeed may be proved by the same authority and the same train of reasoning which has already been used to show the right to take possession of the thing whenever proceedings are in rem. Browne, in his chapter on the practice of the instance court, shows its regular course to be to decree a sale where the goods are in a perishable condition.</p>
<p>The plaintiffs allege that this power to decree a sale is founded on the possession of the cause, but the court can perceive no ground for such an opinion. It is supported by no principle of analogy, and is repugnant to the reason and nature of the thing.</p>
<p>In cases only where the subject itself is in possession of the court, is the order of sale made. If it be delivered on security to either party, an order of sale pending the cause is unheard of in admiralty proceedings. The motive assigned for the order never is that the court is in possession of the cause, but that the property in possession of the court is in a perishable state. A right to order a sale is for the benefit of all parties, not because the case is depending in that particular court, but because the thing may perish while in its custody, and while neither party can enjoy its use.</p>
<p>If then the principle on which the power of the court to order a sale depends, is not that the cause is depending in court, but that perishable property is in its possession, this principle exists in as much force after as before an appeal. The property does not follow the appeal into the superior <span class="star-pagination">*27</span> court. It still remains in custody of the officer of that court in which it was libelled. The case of its preservation is not altered by the appeal. The duty to preserve it is still the same, and it would seem reasonable that the power consequent on that duty would be also retained.</p>
<p>On the principles of reason, therefore, the court is satisfied that the tribunal whose officer retains possession of the thing retains the power of selling it when in a perishing condition, although the cause may be carried by appeal to a superior court. This opinion is not unsupported by authority.</p>
<p>In his chapter on the practice of the instance court, page 405. Browne says, "If the ship or goods are in a state of decay, or of a perishable nature, the court is used, during the pendency of a suit, or sometimes after sentence, notwithstanding an appeal, to issue a commission of appraisement and sale, the money to be lodged with the registrar of the court, in usum jus habentis."</p>
<p>This practice does not appear to be established by statute, but to be incident to the jurisdiction of the court, and to grow out of the principles which form its law. A prize court not regulated by particular statute would proceed on the same principles Â— at least there is the same reason for it.</p>
<p>But there is in this case no distinct order of sale. The order is a part of the sentence from which an appeal was prayed, and is therefore said to be suspended with the residue of that sentence.</p>
<p>The proceedings of the court of admiralty, if they are all before this court, were certainly very irregular, and much of the difficulty of this case arises from that cause; but as this case stands, it would seem entirely unjust to decree the defendant to pay a heavy sum of money, because the court of admiralty has done irregularly that which it had an unquestionable right to do.</p>
<p>Since the court of admiralty possessed the power of making a distinct order of sale immediately after the appeal was entered, and this, but for the depreciation, would <span class="star-pagination">*28</span> have been desirable by all, it is not unreasonable to suppose the practice to have been to consider the appeal as made from the condemnation, and not from the order of sale. The manner in which this appeal was entered affords some countenance to this opinion. In the recital of the matter appealed from, the condemnation alone, not the order of sale, is stated.</p>
<p>The court will not consider this irregularity of the admiralty, in ordering what was within its power, as charging the owners of the privateer, under the decree of the 23d of December, 1780, with the amount of the sales of the George and her cargo, which in point of fact never came to their hands, and over which they never possessed a legal controul, for the marshal states himself to hold the net proceeds to the credit of the former owners.</p>
<p>It is therefore the unanimous opinion of this court that the decree of the 23d of December, 1780, does not require that the restoration and redelivery which it orders should be effected by the captors, but by those who in point of law and fact were in possession either of the George and her cargo, or of the money for which they were sold. As the officer of the court of New-Jersey, not the captors, held this possession, the decree operates upon him, not upon them.</p>
<p>On that part of the libel in this case which may be considered as supplemental, and as asking relief in addition to that which was given by the decree of the 23d of December, 1780, the court deems it necessary to make but a very few observations.</p>
<p>The whole argument in favour of this part of the claim is founded on the idea that the captors were wrong doers, and are responsible for all the loss which has been produced by their tortious act. The sentence of reversal and restoration is considered by the plaintiffs as conclusive evidence that they were wrong doers.</p>
<p>But the court can by no means assent to this principle. A belligerent cruizer who with probable cause seizes a neutral and takes her into port for adjudication, <span class="star-pagination">*29</span> and proceeds regularly, is not a wrong doer. The act is not tortious. The order of restoration proves that the property was neutral, not that it was taken without probable cause. Indeed, the decree of the court of appeals is in this respect in favour of the captors, since it does not award damages for the capture and detention, nor give costs in the suit below.</p>
<p>If we pass by the decree, and examine the testimony on which it was founded, we cannot hesitate to admit that there was justifiable cause to seize and libel the vessel.</p>
<p>Upon the whole case then, the court is unanimously of opinion that the decree of the circuit court ought to be affirmed.</p>
<p>Sentence affirmed.</p>

v.<br/>
THE INSURANCE COMPANY OF PENNSYLVANIA.</h1></center>
<center><p><b>Supreme Court of United States.</b></p></center>
<center></center>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*30</span> Hopkinson, for the plaintiff.</p>
<p>For the defendants, Rawle and Lewis contended.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*40</span> <span class="star-pagination">*41</span> MARSHALL, Ch. J. delivered the opinion of the court as follows.</p>
<p>The Manhattan, a neutral ship, while prosecuting the voyage insured, was captured by a belligerent cruiser, the second mate and twenty-one of the hands were taken out, and two British officers and fifteen seamen put on board, and she was ordered into a British port. The mate soon afterwards arrived in the United States in another vessel. On the 26th of February, 1805, he gave information of these facts to the owner of the Manhattan, who on the 28th of the same month communicated it to the insurers, and offered to abandon to them. On the 2d of April payment of the freight was demanded and refused. The Manhattan was carried into Bermudas, and libelled as prize of war. On the 20th of April in the same year, both vessel and cargo were acquitted. From this sentence, so far as respected the cargo only, an appeal was prayed, which does not appear to have been decided. The cargo was delivered to the owners on their giving security, and on the 8th of July the vessel and cargo arrived at the port of destination. The underwriters having refused to give counter security, this action was brought on the 6th of June, after the vessel was liberated, and before her arrival at the port of destination. The policy is on the freight.</p>
<p>The question referred to this court is, whether the facts stated entitle the insured to recover against the underwriters for a total loss.</p>
<p>In examining this question, the material points to be determined are,</p>
<p>1st. Had the insured a right to abandon when the offer was made?</p>
<p>2dly. Have any circumstances since occurred which affect this right?</p>
<p>These are important questions to the commercial interest of the United States, and ought to be settled with as much clearness as the case admits.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*42</span> It is universally agreed, that to constitute a right to abandon, there must have existed a total loss, occasioned by one of the perils insured against; but this total loss may be real, or legal. Where the loss is real, a controversy can only respect the fact; but the circumstances which constitute a legal, or technical loss, yet remain in many cases, open for consideration.</p>
<p>It has been decided that a capture, by one belligerent from another, constitutes, in the technical sense of the word, a total loss, and gives an immediate right to the insured to abandon to the insurers, although the vessel may afterwards be recaptured and restored.</p>
<p>It has also been decided, that an embargo or detention by a foreign friendly power, constitutes a total loss, and warrants an immediate abandonment. But the capture, or taking at sea of a neutral vessel by a belligerent, is a case on which the courts of England, do not appear to have expressly decided, and which must depend on general principles, on analogy, and on a reasonable construction of the contract between the parties.</p>
<p>A capture by an enemy is a total loss, although the property be not changed, because the taking is with an intent to deprive the owner of it, and because the hope of recovery is too small, and too remote to suspend the right of the insured, in expectation of that event.</p>
<p>If a neutral ship be captured as enemy-property, the taking is unquestionably with a design to deprive the owner of it; and the hope of recovery is in many cases remote, since it may often depend on an appellate court; and though not equally improbable as in the case of capture by an enemy, is not so certain as is stated in argument by the counsel for the defendants.</p>
<p>The distinction between a capture by an enemy and by a belligerent not an enemy, has not been taken in the cases adjudged in England, so far as those cases have been laid before the court, and the best general writers seem to arrange them in the same class. 2 Marshall, 422. 435.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*43</span> It has been also determined, that a total loss existed in the case of an embargo, or the detention of a foreign prince.</p>
<p>In one case cited at the bar, (Saloucci v. Johnson), the court of king's bench determined that an illegal arrest at sea amounted to a detention by a foreign prince, and although that case has since been overruled in England, so far as it decided that to resist a search did not justify a seizure, yet the principle that an arrest at sea was to be resolved into a detention by a foreign power, has not been denied. Marshall, (435.) after noticing the contrary decisions respecting the right of a neutral to resist a search, adds, "yet the above case of Saloucci v. Johnson may nevertheless, I conceive, be considered as an authority to prove, that if a neutral ship be unlawfully arrested and detained by a belligerent cruiser, for any pretended offence against the law of nations, this would be a detention of princes."</p>
<p>That a detention of a foreign power by embargo, or otherwise, warrants an abandonment, is well settled. 2 Marshall, 483.</p>
<p>The opinion given by the court of king's bench in the case of Saloucci v. Johnson, goes no further than to establish that an unlawful arrest at sea is to be considered as the detention of a foreign prince. Whether the arrest can only be considered as unlawful when the cause alleged, if true, is not in itself sufficient to justify a seizure, or when, if true, it would be sufficient, but is in reality contrary to the fact, is not stated. In point of reason, however, it would seem that when an arrest is made at sea by a person acting under the authority of a prince, the detention is as much the detention of princes in the one case as in the other.</p>
<p>In the case of an embargo, the detention is lawful. The right of any power to lay an embargo has not been questioned. Yet it is universally admitted, that an embargo constitutes a detention which amounts, at the time, to a total loss, and warrants an abandonment.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*44</span> In what consists the difference between a detention occasioned by an embargo, and a detention occasioned by an arrest at sea of a neutral by a belligerent power?</p>
<p>An embargo is not laid with a view to deprive the owner of his property, but the arrest is made with that view. In the first case, therefore, the property detained is not in hazard; in the last, it always is in hazard. So far the claim to abandon on an arrest is supported by stronger reason than the claim to abandon when detained by an embargo.</p>
<p>But it is argued that the duration of an embargo has no definite limitation, while a neutral vessel may count on being instantly discharged. Such is the rapidity of proceeding in a court of admiralty, that its mandate of restoration is figuratively said to be "borne on the wings of the wind."</p>
<p>Commercial contracts have but little connection with figurative language, and are seldom rightly expounded by a course of artificial reasoning. Merchants generally regard the fact itself; and if the fact be attended to, an embargo seldom continues as long as the trial of a prize cause, where an appeal is interposed. The history of modern Europe, it is believed, does not furnish an instance of an embargo of equal duration with the question whether the cargo of the Manhattan be or be not lawful prize. The reasoning of the books in the case of a capture by an enemy, and of an embargo, applies in terms, but certainly in reason, to an arrest by a belligerent, not an enemy. 2 Marshall, 483.</p>
<p>The reasoning of the English judges in all the cases which have been read at bar, and their decisions on the question of abandonment, have received the attention of the court. To go through those cases would protract this opinion to a length unnecessarily tedious. With respect to them, therefore, it will only be observed, that the principles laid down appear to be applicable to an arrest as well as to a capture, or detention of foreign powers; and that a distinction between an arrest and such capture or detention, has never been taken.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*45</span> The contract of insurance is said to be a contract of indemnity, and therefore (it is urged by the underwriters, and has been repeatedly urged by them) the assured can only recover according to the damage he has sustained. This is true, and has uniformly been admitted. But if full compensation could only be demanded where there was an actual total loss, an abandonment could only take place where there was nothing to abandon.</p>
<p>There are situations in which the delay of the voyage, the deprivation of the right to conduct it, produce inconveniences to the insured, for the calculation of which the law affords and can afford no standard. In such cases there is, for the time, a total loss: and in this state of things the insured may abandon to the underwriter, who stands in his place, and to whom justice is done, by enabling him to receive all that the insured might receive. A capture by an enemy and an embargo by a foreign power are admitted to be within this rule, and a complete arrest by a belligerent not an enemy, seems, in reason, to be equally within it.</p>
<p>It is, therefore, the unanimous opinion of the court, that where, as in this case, there is a complete taking at sea by a belligerent, who has taken full possession of the vessel as prize, and continues that possession to the time of the abandonment, there exists, in point of law, a total loss, and the act of abandonment vests the right to the thing abandoned in the underwriters, and the amount of insurance in the assured.</p>
<p>2. Have any circumstances occurred since the abandonment, which have converted this total into a partial loss?</p>
<p>Without reviewing the conduct of the assured subsequent to that period, it will be sufficient to observe that he has performed no act which can be construed into a relinquishment of the right which was vested in him by the offer to abandon.</p>
<p>It only remains, then, to inquire whether the release and return of the Manhattan deprives the assured of <span class="star-pagination">*46</span> the right to resort to the underwriters for a total loss, which was given by the abandonment.</p>
<p>This point has never been decided in the courts of England.</p>
<p>In the case of Hamilton v. Mendez, Lord Mansfield leaves it completely undetermined, whether the state of loss at the time the abandonment is made, or at the time of action brought, or at the time of the verdict rendered, shall fix the right to recover for a partial or a total loss.</p>
<p>A majority of the judges are of opinion that the state of loss at the time of the abandonment must fix the rights of the parties to recover on an action afterwards brought; and the judge who doubts respecting it, is of opinion that, in this case, counter security having been refused by the underwriters, the question of freight is yet suspended.</p>
<p>It is to be certified to the circuit court of Pennsylvania, that in the case stated for the opinion of this court, the plaintiff is entitled to recover for a total loss.</p>

<center></center>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*50</span> Rodney, Attorney General, for the plaintiffs in error.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*55</span> MARSHALL, Ch. J. delivered the opinion of the court.<sup>[*]</sup></p>
<p>The single question in this case is, whether an American registered vessel, in part transferred by parol while at sea to an American citizen and resold to the original owners on her return into port, before her entry, does by that operation lose her privileges as an American bottom, and become subject to foreign duties.</p>
<p>This question depends on the "act concerning the registering and recording of ships and vessels," and more particularly on the 14th and 17th sections of that act.</p>
<p>In construing the 14th section, much depends on the true legislative meaning of the word "when." The plaintiffs in error contend that it designates the precise time when a particular act must be performed in order to save a forfeiture; the defendants insist that it describes the occurrence which shall render that particular act necessary. That the term may be used, and, either in law or in common parlance, is frequently used in the one or the other of these senses, cannot be controverted; and, of course, the context must decide in which sense it is used in the law under consideration.</p>
<p>The particular act to be performed in order to save the forfeiture of the American character, and the privileges attached to it, is the obtaining a new register; and the first inquiry is, whether this new register must be obtained at the time of transfer, or at some other convenient time on the event of a transfer.</p>
<p>This would seem to the court scarcely to admit of a doubt. It has been correctly argued that the precise <span class="star-pagination">*56</span> time to register the vessel anew cannot be prescribed by the word "when," because the direction does not follow that word in the sentence so as to be limited by it with respect to time. It is not said that when a registered vessel shall be transferred or altered, she shall obtain a new register or cease to be an American vessel, but the continuity of the sentence is broken by interposing the words "in every such case," thereby clearly making the forfeiture to depend on the failure to register on the event described, not on the failure to register at the precise time when the event described occurs.</p>
<p>This observation also applies to a subsequent part of the section, where the forfeiture is repeated, and depends on the failure to register, not on the failure to register at the precise time of transfer.</p>
<p>But this construction, which is the fair and natural exposition of the words themselves, is rendered still more obviously necessary by the nature of the case, and by the context.</p>
<p>No man will contend that the transfer or the change in a vessel, and the obtaining a new register, are to be simultaneous. The one must precede the other, and unless the transfer, or the repairs and alterations of the hulk or rigging are in all cases to be made in the office from which the new register is to be obtained, a reasonable interval between these acts must be allowed. This reasonable interval will depend on the nature of the case.</p>
<p>When must a new register be obtained for a vessel which has been altered or partially transferred to a citizen while at sea? The act answers, at the time of delivering up her former certificate of registry. And when can this former certificate be delivered up? Certainly not till the return of the vessel, for the certificate is a paper necessary to the vessel, and is therefore always retained on board while at sea.</p>
<p>This construction is really so obvious and inevitable, that the endeavour to make it more clear would seem to be a total misapplication of time.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*57</span> The question, at what time the new register is to be obtained, and at what time the vessel shall be affected by the failure to obtain it, is susceptible of rather more doubt. There is no impossibility in obtaining a new register before entry, and the necessity of doing so must depend upon the words of the act, and upon the nature of the case.</p>
<p>It is obvious that on her arrival in port the Missouri was an American vessel, and her cargo, when imported into the United States, was liable to the duties imposed on American, not on foreign bottoms. This is the clear consequence of establishing that a new register was not required before the arrival of the vessel.</p>
<p>If then the cargo when imported was liable only to the duties on goods imported in an American bottom, it would certainly require plain words to charge them, on any subsequent failure, with higher duties.</p>
<p>If the words of the section be examined, they are, as has been stated at the bar, prospective, not retrospective. They operate on future, not on past transactions. "The vessel shall be registered anew, (otherwise she shall cease to be deemed a ship or vessel of the United States.") That is, she shall cease after the lapse of the time when she ought to have been registered anew. But before that time had elapsed, she had as an American vessel actually imported a cargo whose liability to duties had commenced.</p>
<p>So in the subsequent clause: "And in every case in which a ship or vessel is hereby required to be registered anew, if she shall not be so registered anew, she shall not be entitled to any of the privileges or benefits of a ship or vessel of the United States." That is, her future earnings shall not be attended with the advantages annexed to American bottoms.</p>
<p>This construction derives some corroboration from the 17th section. This section provides for the oath which is to be taken by an owner on the entry of an American vessel. "That upon the entry of every ship," &amp;c.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*58</span> If upon the entry the owner shall refuse to take this oath, the vessel loses the privileges of an American bottom. If he takes it, and the oath discloses no fact which has already forfeited those privileges, she retains them. It is observable, that in order to retain them she is not required to take out a new register if an alienation has been made, and this strengthens the idea that if such an alienation be not in itself a forfeiture, a new register cannot be requisite so far as respects the voyage already concluded.</p>
<p>In the case of alienation to a foreigner, the privileges of an American bottom are ipso facto forfeited; but in the case of an alienation to a citizen they are not forfeited until after she ought to have been registered anew, and the oath which entitles her to enter as an American bottom does not require such new register.</p>
<p>But it has been argued that the omission to execute a bill of sale in writing at the time of sale is in itself a forfeiture of the American character.</p>
<p>The words of the act are, "And in every such case of sale or transfer," &amp;c.</p>
<p>These words attach to the omission the penalty which the law annexes to it, and no other can be inflicted. This is not that the vessel shall lose her American character, but that she shall be incapable of being registered anew. The bill of sale, therefore, can only be required when the new register is to be obtained, and if it be then produced, the new register cannot be refused.</p>
<p>An opinion has already been indicated, that in the case of a transfer or alienation at sea, a new register is not necessary to protect from alien duties the vessel which arrives, and the cargo which was actually imported while the old register was in full force. But it is the opinion of the court that in the case under consideration no new register was requisite.</p>
<p>The new register must be in every thing but its date a precise copy of the old one. The oath to be administered on the entry could be truly and fairly taken. The <span class="star-pagination">*59</span> names of all the persons who were at the time owners of the vessel were in the old register. The intermediate alienation and repurchase of part of the vessel had worked no forfeiture, and had created no necessity for a new register. The parties to whom the alienation had been made, not having property in the vessel at the time of entry, could not have taken the oath prescribed by law, which is in the present tense, and refers to the actual state of the property at the time of entry; nor could a new register have issued to them, in order to be delivered up for the purpose of making out another register for the original owners, who had become the present owners, without departing from the truth of the case, because the register also speaks in the present tense, and must recite the names of those who are the real owners at its date. Any new register which could have issued must have been, except in date, a duplicate of the old one, and must have been perfectly useless. Suppose the ship had been altered in a foreign port, but before her arrival and entry had resumed the form and dimensions mentioned in her old register, would it be pretended that a new register was necessary? What would such new register be but a copy of the old one? It is believed that in such a case it would not be suspected that any forfeiture of the old register, or any necessity for a new one, was produced, and between the two cases there appears to be no difference made by the letter or the spirit of the act.</p>
<p>The court is, therefore, unanimously of opinion, that the sentence of the circuit court be affirmed.</p>
<p>Judgment affirmed.</p>

<p></p>
<h2>
<span class="star-pagination">*69</span> February 16.</h2>
<p>MARSHALL, Ch. J. delivered the opinion of the court.</p>
<p>This case comes up on exceptions to certain opinions given by the judges of the circuit court of Rhode-Island, at the trial of the cause before them.</p>
<p>The first exception is to the admission of Peleg Remington as a witness.</p>
<p>This exception appeared to be abandoned by the counsel in reply, and is, indeed, so perfectly untenable, that the court will only observe, that Peleg Remington does not appear to have been interested in the event of the cause in which he deposed, but certainly was not interested in the particular fact to which he was required to depose, and was therefore clearly a competent witness.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*70</span> The second exception is taken to the opinion of the court admitting as evidence a paper purporting to be the copy of a letter written by the defendant, Carrington, to Smith &amp; Ridgeway of Philadelphia, the correspondents of the plaintiffs, and also a letter from Smith &amp; Ridgeway to the defendant, Carrington, purporting to be an answer to the said letter.</p>
<p>To the admission of the letter of Smith &amp; Ridgeway, no just objection appears. The verity of that letter is acknowledged on the face of the bill of exceptions, and no cause is stated why it should not have been read to the jury. But the admission of the copy of a letter written by one of the defendants, stands upon totally different ground.</p>
<p>To introduce into a cause the copy of any paper, the truth of that copy must be established, and sufficient reasons for the non-production of the original must be shown.</p>
<p>If in this case the answer of Smith &amp; Ridgeway had authenticated the whole letter of Carrington, the copy of that letter need not have been offered, since its whole contents would have been proved by the answer to it. If its whole contents were not proved by the answer, then the part not so proved was totally unauthenticated, and may have formed no part of the original letter. In this case, the answer cannot have authenticated the copy, because the bill states that the defendants gave no proof of its being true. This copy, therefore, not being proved to be a true copy, ought not to have gone before the jury. Into its importance or operation, this court cannot inquire. It was improper testimony, and a verdict founded on improper testimony cannot stand.</p>
<p>For this error the judgment must be reversed, and the cause remanded to the circuit court of Rhode-Island, to be again tried.</p>
<p>The third exception is taken to the refusal of the court to give an opinion on a question, stated by the counsel for the plaintiffs. The difficulty of deciding on this exception does not arise from any doubt which <span class="star-pagination">*71</span> ought to have been produced by the facts in the cause, but from the manner in which the question was propounded to the court.</p>
<p>After a long and complex statement of the testimony, the counsel for the plaintiffs requested the court to declare whether, "if the plaintiffs had actually paid the said premium to the underwriters, before any notice of the change of the destination of the ship, they had a right, under the circumstances of the case, to recover the same of the defendant."</p>
<p>To this question the court refused to give an answer.</p>
<p>There can be no doubt of the right of a party to require the opinion of the court on any point of law which is pertinent to the issue, nor that the refusal of the court to give such opinion furnishes cause for an exception; but it is equally clear that the court cannot be required to give to the jury an opinion on the truth of testimony in any case.</p>
<p>Had the plaintiffs' counsel been content with the answer of the court to the question of law, he would have been entitled to that answer; but when he involved fact with law, and demanded the opinion of the court on the force and truth of the testimony, by adding the words "under the circumstances of the case," the question is so qualified as to be essentially changed; and although the court might with propriety have separated the law from the fact, and have stated the legal principle, leaving the fact to the jury, there was no obligation to make this discrimination, and consequently no error was committed in refusing to answer the question propounded.</p>
<p>The record also exhibits a part of the charge given to the jury, on which the counsel for the plaintiffs have argued as if it composed a part of the bill of exceptions. It is in these words: "And the said court, prior to the request last mentioned, did declare and give their opinion to said jury, that the case wholly turned upon the point whether or not the said defendants <span class="star-pagination">*72</span> had given due and seasonable notice of the change of the destination of said ship. That it was a question proper for the said jury to decide whether such due and seasonable notice had been given; and that if they were of opinion it had been so given, on considering the whole of the evidence, they ought not to allow the plaintiffs' said charge for said premium."</p>
<p>That a party has a right to except to a misdirection of the jury contained in the charge of the judge who tries the cause, is settled in this court. (Ante, vol. 2. p. 269. Church v. Hubbart.)</p>
<p>That the opinion which the record ascribes to the judge in this case, is incorrect, unless some other part of the charge shall have so explained it as to give to the words a meaning different from that which is affixed to them taken by themselves, is the opinion of this court.</p>
<p>The judges instructed the jury, "that the case wholly turned upon the point whether or not the defendants had given due and seasonable notice of the change of the destination of the said ship," and that if they were of opinion that due and seasonable notice had been given, they ought to find against the plaintiffs, on the question of their right to recover the premium advanced by them for the defendants.</p>
<p>Due and seasonable notice, must have been given as soon after the destination of the vessel was changed, as it would have been given, whether the premium had or had not been advanced by the plaintiffs before they received it; or this direction must have left it to the jury to determine whether notice was or was not due and seasonable, although it might not have been received by the plaintiffs before they had actually advanced for the defendants the sum in contest.</p>
<p>On the first exposition, these words would amount to a clear misdirection of the jury; because, if the plaintiffs had paid to the underwriters, at the request of the defendants, the premium of insurance, before they received notice countermanding the directions to make such payment, the right given by subsequent circumstances <span class="star-pagination">*73</span> to the insured to demand its return from the underwriters, could not affect the claim of the plaintiffs on the defendants, for money fairly advanced by them for the use of the defendants.</p>
<p>If the latter construction be adopted, there was still a misdirection on the part of the court. The judge ought not to have left it expressly to the jury to decide whether notice given immediately after the change of the destination of the vessel could be due and seasonable notice, unless it was received before the premium was advanced.</p>
<p>It is, however, not material to the present cause to determine whether this exception does or does not exhibit a misdirection to the jury, since we are unanimously of opinion, that for admitting a paper purporting to be the copy of a letter from Edward Carrington to Smith &amp; Ridgeway, to go to the jury, which was not proved to be a copy, the judgment must be reversed.</p>
<p>Judgment reversed,</p>

<p>If the writ of error had been served when it was not in force, (that is, after its return day,) such service would have been void. But if served while in force, a return afterwards will be good.</p>

<center><h1>EX PARTE BOLLMAN AND EX PARTE SWARTWOUT</h1></center>
<center><p><b>Supreme Court of United States.</b></p></center>
<center></center>

<p>Rodney, Attorney General, declined arguing the point on behalf of the United States.</p>
<p>Harper, for Bollman.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*93</span> MARSHALL, Ch. J.<sup>[*]</sup> delivered the opinion of the court, as follows:</p>
<p>As preliminary to any investigation of the merits of this motion, this court deems it proper to declare that it disclaims all jurisdiction not given by the constitution, or by the laws of the United States.</p>
<p>Courts which originate in the common law possess a jurisdiction which must be regulated by their common law, until some statute shall change their established principles; but courts which are created by written law, and whose jurisdiction is defined by written law, cannot transcend that jurisdiction. It is unnecessary to state the reasoning on which this opinion is founded, because it has been repeatedly given by this court; and with the decisions heretofore rendered on this point, no member of the bench has, even for an instant, been dissatisfied. The reasoning from the bar, in relation to it, may be answered by the single observation, that for the meaning <span class="star-pagination">*94</span> of the term habeas corpus, resort may unquestionably be had to the common law; but the power to award the writ by any of the courts of the United States, must be given by written law.</p>
<p>This opinion is not to be considered as abridging the power of courts over their own officers, or to protect themselves, and their members, from being disturbed in the exercise of their functions. It extends only to the power of taking cognizance of any question between individuals, or between the government and individuals.</p>
<p>To enable the court to decide on such question, the power to determine it must he given by written law.</p>
<p>The inquiry therefore on this motion will be, whether by any statute, compatible with the constitution of the United States, the power to award a writ of habeas corpus, in such a case as that of Erick Bollman and Samuel Swartwout, has been given to this court.</p>
<p>The 14th section of the judicial act (Laws U.S. vol. 1. p. 53.) has been considered as containing a substantive grant of this power.</p>
<p>It is in these words: "That all the before mentioned courts of the United States shall have power to issue writs of scire facias, habeas corpus, and all other writs, not specially provided for by statute, which may be necessary for the exercise of their respective jurisdictions, and agreeable to the principles and usages of law. And that either of the justices of the supreme court, as well as judges of the district courts, shall have power to grant writs of habeas corpus, for the purpose of an inquiry into the cause of commitment. Provided, that writs of habeas corpus shall in no case extend to prisoners in goal, unless where they are in custody under or by colour of the authority of the United States, or are committed for trial before some court of the same, or are necessary to be brought into court to testify."</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*95</span> The only doubt of which this section can be susceptible is, whether the restrictive words of the first sentence limit the power to the award of such writs of habeas corpus as are necessary to enable the courts of the United States to exercise their respective jurisdictions in some cause which they are capable of finally deciding.</p>
<p>It has been urged, that in strict grammatical construction, these words refer to the last antecedent, which is, "all other writs not specially provided for by statute."</p>
<p>This criticism may be correct, and is not entirely without its influence; but the sound construction which the court thinks it safer to adopt, is, that the true sense of the words is to be determined by the nature of the provision, and by the context.</p>
<p>It may be worthy of remark, that this act was passed by the first congress of the United States, sitting under a constitution which had declared "that the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus should not be suspended, unless when, in cases of rebellion or invasion, the public safety might require it."</p>
<p>Acting under the immediate influence of this injunction, they must have felt, with peculiar force, the obligation of providing efficient means by which this great constitutional privilege should receive life and activity; for if the means be not in existence, the privilege itself would be lost, although no law for its suspension should be enacted. Under the impression of this obligation, they give, to all the courts, the power of awarding writs of habeas corpus.</p>
<p>It has been truly said, that this is a generic term, and includes every species of that writ. To this it may be added, that when used singly Â— when we say the writ of habeas corpus, without addition, we most generally mean that great writ which is now applied for; and in that sense it is used in the constitution.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*96</span> The section proceeds to say, that "either of the justices of the supreme court, as well as judges of the district courts, shall have power to grant writs of habeas corpus for the purpose of an inquiry into the cause of commitment."</p>
<p>It has been argued that congress could never intend to give a power of this kind to one of the judges of this court, which is refused to all of them when assembled.</p>
<p>There is certainly much force in this argument, and it receives additional strength from the consideration, that if the power be denied to this court, it is denied to every other court of the United States; the right to grant this important writ is given, in this sentence, to every judge of the circuit, or district court, but can neither be exercised by the circuit nor district court. It would be strange if the judge, sitting on the bench, should be unable to hear a motion for this writ where it might be openly made, and openly discussed, and might yet retire to his chamber, and in private receive and decide upon the motion. This is not consistent with the genius of our legislation, nor with the course of our judicial proceedings. It would be much more consonant with both, that the power of the judge at his chambers should be suspended during his term, than that it should be exercised only in secret.</p>
<p>Whatever motives might induce the legislature to withhold from the supreme court the power to award the great writ of habeas corpus, there could be none which would induce them to withhold it from every court in the United States: and as it is granted to all in the same sentence and by the same words, the sound construction would seem to be, that the first sentence vests this power in all the courts of the United States; but as those courts are not always in session, the second sentence vests it in every justice or judge of the United States.</p>
<p>The doubt which has been raised on this subject may be further explained by examining the character of the various writs of habeas corpus, and selecting those to which this general grant of power must be restricted, if taken in the limited sense of being merely used to enable <span class="star-pagination">*97</span> the court to exercise its jurisdiction in causes which it is enabled to decide finally.</p>
<p>The various writs of habeas corpus, as stated and accurately defined by judge Blackstone, (3 Bl. Com. 129.) are, 1st. The writ of habeas corpus ad respondendum, "when a man hath a cause of action against one who is confined by the process of some inferior court; in order to remove the prisoner and charge him with this new action in the court above."</p>
<p>This case may occur when a party having a right to sue in this court, (as a state at the time of the passage of this act, or a foreign minister,) wishes to institute a suit against a person who is already confined by the process of an inferior court. This confinement may be either by the process of a court of the United States, or of a state court. If it be in a court of the United States, this writ would be inapplicable, because perfectly useless, and consequently could not be contemplated by the legislature. It would not be required, in such case, to bring the body of the defendant actually into court, as he would already be in the charge of the person who, under an original writ from this court, would be directed to take him into custody, and would already be confined in the same jail in which he would be confined under the process of this court, if he should be unable to give bail.</p>
<p>If the party should be confined by process from a state court, there are many additional reasons against the use of this writ in such a case.</p>
<p>The state courts are not, in any sense of the word, inferior courts, except in the particular cases in which an appeal lies from their judgment to this court; and in these cases the mode of proceeding is particularly prescribed, and is not by habeas corpus. They are not inferior courts because they emanate from a different authority, and are the creatures of a distinct government.</p>
<p>2d. The writ of habeas corpus ad satisfaciendum, "when a prisoner hath had judgment against him in an action, and the plaintiff is desirous to bring him up to <span class="star-pagination">*98</span> some superior court to charge him with process of execution."</p>
<p>This case can never occur in the courts of the United States. One court never awards execution on the judgment of another. Our whole juridical system forbids it.</p>
<p>3d. Ad prosequendum, testificandum, deliberandum, &amp;c. "which issue when it is necessary to remove a prisoner, in order to prosecute, or bear testimony, in any court, or to be tried in the proper jurisdiction wherein the fact was committed."</p>
<p>This writ might unquestionably be employed to bring up a prisoner to bear testimony in a court, consistently with the most limited construction of the words in the act of congress; but the power to bring a person up that he may be tried in the proper jurisdiction is understood to be the very question now before the court.</p>
<p>4th, and last. The common writ ad faciendum et recipiendum, "which issues out of any of the courts of Westminster-hall, when a person is sued in some inferior jurisdiction, and is desirous to remove the action into the superior court, commanding the inferior judges to produce the body of the defendant, together with the day and cause of his caption and detainer, (whence the writ is frequently denominated an habeas corpus cum causa,) to do and receive whatever the king's court shall consider in that behalf. This writ is grantable of common right, without any motion in court, and it instantly supersedes all proceedings in the court below."</p>
<p>Can a solemn grant of power to a court to award a writ be considered as applicable to a case in which that writ, if issuable at all, issues by law without the leave of the court?</p>
<p>It would not be difficult to demonstrate that the writ of habeas corpus cum causa cannot be the particular writ contemplated by the legislature in the section under consideration; but it will be sufficient to observe generally that the same act prescribes a different mode for bringing into the courts of the United States suits brought in a <span class="star-pagination">*99</span> state court against a person having a right to claim the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States. He may, on his first appearance, file his petition and authenticate the fact, upon which the cause is ipso facto removed into the courts of the United States.</p>
<p>The only power then, which on this limited construction would be granted by the section under consideration, would be that of issuing writs of habeas corpus ad testificandum. The section itself proves that this was not the intention of the legislature. It concludes with the following proviso, "That writs of habeas corpils shall in no case extend to prisoners in jail, unless where they are in custody under or by colour of the authority of the United States, or are committed for trial before some court of the same, or are necessary to be brought into court to testify."</p>
<p>This proviso extends to the whole section. It limits the powers previously granted to the courts, because it specifies a case in which it is particularly applicable to the use of the power by courts: Â— where the person is necessary to be brought into court to testify. That construction cannot be a fair one which would make the legislature except from the operation of a proviso, limiting the express grant of a power, the whole power intended to be granted.</p>
<p>From this review of the extent of the power of awarding writs of habeas corpus, if the section be construed in its restricted sense; from a comparison of the nature of the writ which the courts of the United States would, on that view of the subject, be enabled to issue; from a comparison of the power so granted with the other parts of the section, it is apparent that this limited sense of the term cannot be that which was contemplated by the legislature.</p>
<p>But the 33d section throws much light upon this question. It contains these words: "And upon all arrests in criminal cases, bail shall be admitted, except where the punishment may be death; in which cases it shall not be admitted but by the supreme or a circuit court, or by a justice of the supreme court, or a judge of a district <span class="star-pagination">*100</span> court, who shall exercise their discretion therein, regarding the nature and circumstances of the offence, and of the evidence, and of the usages of law."</p>
<p>The appropriate process of bringing up a prisoner, not committed by the court itself, to be bailed, is by the writ now applied for. Of consequence, a court possessing the power to bail prisoners not committed by itself, may award a writ of habeas corpus for the exercise of that power. The clause under consideration obviously proceeds on the supposition that this power was previously given, and is explanatory of the 14th section.</p>
<p>If, by the sound construction of the act of congress, the power to award writs of habeas corpus in order to examine into the cause of commitment is given to this court, it remains to inquire whether this be a case in which the writ ought to be granted.</p>
<p>The only objection is, that the commitment has been made by a court having power to commit and to bail.</p>
<p>Against this objection the argument from the bar has been so conclusive that nothing can be added to it.</p>
<p>If then this were res integra, the court would decide in favour of the motion. But the question is considered as long since decided. The case of Hamilton is expressly in point in all its parts; and although the question of jurisdiction was not made at the bar, the case was several days under advisement, and this question could not have escaped the attention of the court. From that decision the court would not lightly depart. (United States v. Hamilton, 3 Dall. 17.)</p>
<p>If the act of congress gives this court the power to award a writ of habeas corpus in the present case, it remains to inquire whether that act be compatible with the constitution.</p>
<p>In the mandamus case, (ante, vol. 1. p. 175. Marbury v. Madison,) it was decided that this court would not exercise original jurisdiction except so far as that jurisdiction was given by the constitution. But so far as that <span class="star-pagination">*101</span> case has distinguished between original and appellate jurisdiction, that which the court is now asked to exercise is clearly appellate. It is the revision of a decision of an inferior court, by which a citizen has been committed to jail.</p>
<p>It has been demonstrated at the bar, that the question brought forward on a habeas corpus, is always distinct from that which is involved in the cause itself. The question whether the individual shall be imprisoned is always distinct from the question whether he shall be convicted or acquitted of the charge on which he is to be tried, and therefore these questions are separated, and may be decided in different courts.</p>
<p>The decision that the individual shall be imprisoned must always precede the application for a writ of habeas corpus, and this writ must always be for the purpose of revising that decision, and therefore appellate in its nature.</p>
<p>But this point also is decided in Hamilton's case and in Burford's case.<sup>[*]</sup></p>
<p>If at any time the public safety should require the suspension of the powers vested by this act in the courts of the United States, it is for the legislature to say so.</p>
<p>That question depends on political considerations, on which the legislature is to decide. Until the legislative will be expressed, this court can only see its duty, and must obey the laws.</p>
<p>The motion, therefore, must be granted.</p>
<p>JOHNSON, J.</p>
<p>In this case I have the misfortune to dissent from the majority of my brethren. As it is a case of much interest, I feel it incumbent upon me to assign the reasons upon which I adopt the opinion, that this court has not authority to issue the writ of habeas corpus now moved for. The prisoners are in confinement under a commitment ordered by the superior <span class="star-pagination">*102</span> court of the district of Columbia, upon a charge of high treason. This motion has for its object their discharge or admission to bail, under an order of this court, as circumstances upon investigation shall appear to require. The attorney general having submitted the case without opposition, I will briefly notice such objections as occur to my mind against the arguments urged by the counsel for the prisoners.</p>
<p>Two questions were presented to the consideration of the court.</p>
<p>1st. Does this court possess the power generally of issuing the writ of habeas corpus?</p>
<p>2d. Does it retain that power in this case after the commitment by the district court of Columbia?</p>
<p>In support of the affirmative of the first of these questions, two grounds were assumed.</p>
<p>1st. That the power to issue this writ was necessarily incident to this court, as the supreme tribunal of the union.</p>
<p>2dly. That it is given by statute, and the right to it has been recognized by precedent.</p>
<p>On the first of these questions it is not necessary to ponder long; this court has uniformly maintained that it possesses no other jurisdiction or power than what is given it by the constitution and laws of the United States, or is necessarily incident to the exercise of those expressly given.</p>
<p>Our decision must then rest wholly on the due construction of the constitution and laws of the union, and the effect of precedent, a subject which certainly presents much scope for close legal inquiry, but very little for the play of a chastened imagination.</p>
<p>The first section of the third article of the constitution vests the judicial power of the United States in one supreme court, and in such inferior courts as the congress <span class="star-pagination">*103</span> may from time to time establish. The second section declares the extent of that power, and distinguishes its jurisdiction into original and appellate.</p>
<p>The original jurisdiction of this court is restricted to cases affecting ambassadors or other public ministers, and consuls, and those in which a state shall be a party. In all other cases within the judicial powers of the union, it can exercise only an appellate jurisdiction. The former it possesses independently of the will of any other constituent branch of the general government. Without a violation of the constitution, that division of our jurisdiction can neither be restricted or extended. In the latter its powers are subjected to the will of the legislature of the union, and it can exercise appellate jurisdiction in no case, unless expressly authorised to do so by the laws of congress. If I understand the case of Marbury v. Madison, it maintains this doctrine in its full extent. I cannot see how it could ever have been controverted.</p>
<p>It is incumbent, then, I presume, on the counsel, in order to maintain their motion, to prove that the issuing of this writ is an act within the power of this court in its original jurisdiction, or that, in its appellate capacity, the power is expressly given by the laws of congress.</p>
<p>This it is attempted to do, by the fourteenth and thirty-third sections of the judiciary act, and the cases of Hamilton and Burford, which occurred in this court, the former in 1795, the latter in 1806.</p>
<p>How far their position is supported by that act and those cases, will now be the subject of my inquiry.</p>
<p>With a very unnecessary display of energy and pathos, this court has been imperatively called upon to extend to the prisoners the benefit of precedent. I am far, very far, from denying the general authority of adjudications. Uniformity in decisions is often as important as their abstract justice. But I deny that a court is precluded from the right or exempted from the necessity of examining into the correctness or consistency of its own <span class="star-pagination">*104</span> decisions, or those of any other tribunal. If I need precedent to support me in this doctrine, I will cite the example of this court, which, in the case of the United States v. Moore, February, 1805, acknowledged that in the case of the United States v. Sims, February, 1803, it had exercised a jurisdiction it did not possess. Strange indeed would be the doctrine, that an inadvertency once committed by a court shall ever after impose on it the necessity of persisting in its error. A case that cannot be tested by principle is not law, and in a thousand instances have such cases been declared so by courts of justice.</p>
<p>The claim of the prisoners, as founded on precedent, stands thus. The case of Hamilton was strikingly similar to the present. The prisoner had been committed by order of the district judge on a charge of high treason. A writ of habeas corpus was issued by the supreme court, and the prisoner bailed by their order. The case of Burford was also strictly parallel to the present; but the writ in the latter case having been issued expressly on the authority of the former, it is presumed that it gives no additional force to the claim of the prisoners, but must rest on the strength of the case upon which the court acted.</p>
<p>It appears to my mind that the case of Hamilton bears upon the face of it evidence of its being entitled to little consideration, and that the authority of it was annihilated by the very able decision in Marbury v. Madison. In this case it was decided that congress could not vest in the supreme court any original powers beyond those to which this court is restricted by the constitution. That an act of congress vesting in this court the power to issue a writ of mandamus in a case not within their original jurisdiction, and in which they were not called upon to exercise an appellate jurisdiction, was unconstitutional and void. In the case of Hamilton the court does not assign the reasons on which it founds its decisions, but it is fair to presume that they adopted the idea which appears to have been admitted by the district attorney in his argument, to wit, that this court possessed a concurrent power with the district court in admitting to bail. Now a concurrent power in such a case must be an original <span class="star-pagination">*105</span> power, and the principle in Marbury v. Madison applies as much to the issuing of a habeas corpus in a case of treason, as to the issuing of a mandamus in a case not more remote from the original jurisdiction of this court. Having thus disembarrassed the question from the effect of precedent, I proceed to consider the construction of the two sections of the judiciary act above referred to.</p>
<p>It is necessary to premise that the case of treason is one in which this court possesses neither original nor appellate jurisdiction. The 14th section of the judiciary act, so far as it has relation to this case, is in these words: Â— "All the beforementioned courts (of which this is one) of the United States shall have power to issue writs of scire facias, habeas corpus, and all other writs not specially provided for by statute, which may be necessary for the exercise of their respective jurisdictions, and agreeable to the principles and usages of law." I do not think it material to the opinion I entertain what construction is given to this sentence. If the power to issue the writs of scire facias and habeas corpus be not restricted to the cases within the original or appellate jurisdiction of this court, the case of Marbury and Madison rejects the clause as unavailing; and if it relate only to cases within their jurisdiction, it does not extend to the case which is now moved for. But it is impossible to give a sensible construction to that clause without taking the whole together; it consists of but one sentence, intimately connected throughout, and has for its object the creation of those powers which probably would have vested in the respective courts without statutory provision, as incident to the exercise of their jurisdiction. To give to this clause the construction contended for by counsel, would be to suppose that the legislature would commit the absurd act of granting the power of issuing the writs of scire facias and habeas corpus without an object or end to be answered by them. This idea is not a little supported by the next succeeding clause, in which a power is vested in the individual judges to issue the writ of habeas corpus, expressly for the purpose of inquiring into the cause of commitment. That part of the thirty-third section of the judiciary act which relates to this subject is in the following words: Â— "And <span class="star-pagination">*106</span> upon all arrests in criminal cases, bail shall be admitted, except where the punishment is death, in which cases it shall not be admitted but by the supreme or a circuit court, or by a justice of the supreme court, or a judge of a district court, who shall exercise their discretion therein, regarding the nature and circumstances of the offence, and of the evidence, and usage of law."</p>
<p>On considering this act it cannot be denied that if it vests any power at all, it is an original power. "It is the essential criterion of appellate jurisdiction, that it revises and corrects the proceedings in a cause already instituted." I quote the words of the court in the case of Marbury v. Madison.</p>
<p>And so far is this clause from giving a power to revise and correct, that it actually vests in the district judge the same latitude of discretion by the same words that it communicates to this court. And without derogating from a respectability which I must feel as deep an interest in maintaining as any member of this court, I must believe that the district court, or any individual district judge, possesses the same power to revise our decision, that we do to revise theirs; nay, more, for the powers with which they may be vested are not so particularly limited and divided by the constitution as ours are. Should we perform an act which according to our own principle we cannot be vested with power to perform, what obligation would any other court or judge be under to respect that act? There is one mode of construing this clause, which appears to me to remove all ambiguity, and to render every part of it sensible and operative. By the consent of his sovereign, a foreign minister may be subjected to the laws of the state near which he resides. This court may then be called upon to exercise an original criminal jurisdiction. If the power of this court to bail be confined to that one case, reddendo singula singulis, if the power of the several courts and individual judges be referred to their respective jurisdictions, all clashing and interference of power ceases, and sufficient means of redress are still held out to the citizen, if deprived of his liberty; and this surely must have been the intention of the legislature. It never could have been contemplated that the mandates of this court <span class="star-pagination">*107</span> should be borne to the extremities of the states, to convene before them every prisoner who may be committed under the authority of the general government. Let it be remembered that I am not disputing the power of the individual judges who compose this court to issue the writ of habeas corpus. This application is not made to us as at chambers, but to us as holding the supreme court of the United States Â— a creature of the constitution, and possessing no greater capacity to receive jurisdiction or power than the constitution gives it. We may in our individual capacities, or in our circuit courts, be susceptible of powers merely ministerial, and not inconsistent with our judicial characters, for on that point the constitution has left much to construction; and on such an application the only doubt that could be entertained would be, whether we can exercise any power beyond the limits of our respective circuits. On this question I will not now give an opinion. One more observation, and I dismiss the subject.</p>
<p>In the case of Burford I was one of the members who constituted the court. I owe it to my own consistency to declare that the court were then apprized of my objections to the issuing of the writ of habeas corpus. I did not then comment at large on the reasons which influenced my opinion, and the cause was this: The gentleman who argued that cause confined himself strictly to those considerations which ought alone to influence the decisions of this court. No popular observations on the necessity of protecting the citizen from executive oppression, no animated address calculated to enlist the passions or prejudices of an audience in defence of his motion, imposed on me the necessity of vindicating my opinion. I submitted in silent deference to the decision of my brethren.</p>
<p>In this case I feel myself much relieved from the painful sensation resulting from the necessity of dissenting from the majority of the court, in being supported by the opinion of one of my brethren, who is prevented by indisposition from attending.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*108</span> The marshal of the district of Columbia, having returned, upon the habeas corpus, that he detained the prisoners by virtue of the before recited order of the circuit court of that district,</p>
<p>C. Lee, now moved that they should be discharged; or at least admitted to bail; and contended,</p>
<p>1. That from the record of the circuit court, and upon the face of the proceedings the imprisonment was illegal and oppressive; and</p>
<p>2. That if the commitment was not illegal upon its face, yet as the order of the court refers to the testimony on which it was founded, it will appear to be illegal upon the whole proceedings.</p>
<p>The commitment is not for trial at any particular time, before any particular court, nor in any particular place.</p>
<p>By the 3d article of the constitution of the United States, the trial of crimes shall be in the state where they shall have been committed; but when not committed in any state, the trial shall be at such place or places as congress may by law have directed. So by the 29th section of the judiciary act of 1789, vol. 1. p. 67. in all cases punishable with death, the trial shall be had in the county where the offence was committed, or where that cannot be done without great inconvenience, twelve petit jurors at least shall be summoned from thence; and by the 33d section of the same act, p. 73. offenders are to be arrested and imprisoned or bailed for trial before such court of the United States, as by that act has cognizance of the offence; and copies of the process shall be returned as speedily as may be into the clerk's office of such court, together with the recognizances of the witnesses for their appearance to testify in the case, and if the commitment be in a district other than that in which the offence is to be tried, it shall be the duty of the judge of the district where the delinquent is imprisoned to issue a warrant for the removal of the offender to the district in which the trial is to be had.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*109</span> These are provisions for a speedy and fair trial, in obedience to the constitution; for it has always been considered as necessary to a fair trial that it should be where the witnesses may easily attend, and where the party is known. The 6th amendment to the constitution provides that the accused "shall enjoy the right to "a speedy and public trial by an impartial jury of the "state and district, wherein the crime shall have been "committed, which district shall have been previously "ascertained by law," &amp;c.</p>
<p>By the act for the punishment of certain crimes, section 8 vol. 1. p. 103. it is enacted that "the trial of "crimes committed" "in any place out of the jurisdiction "of any particular state shall be in the district where "the offender is apprehended, or into which he may "first be brought."</p>
<p>By the English habeas corpus act, whose provisions are considered as extending to cases even out of the act, the prisoner may petition the court for trial at the first term, and if not then tried he is entitled to bail of course. If the commitment is in a district in which he cannot be tried, he will not be entitled to this privilege, for he is still to be removed to the place of trial. Hence it is necessary that the commitment should state the court before whom the trial is to be had. It is also necessary in order that the district judge may know where to send him. No person but the district judge has authority to send him to the place of trial, and if the commitment be not made by the district judge, it is impossible that he should judicially know where to send him, unless the place of trial be mentioned in the warrant of commitment.</p>
<p>It is also necessary that the accused may know where to collect his witnesses together.</p>
<p>The order of commitment ought also to have stated more particularly the overt act of treason. It is too vague and uncertain.</p>
<p>3. The testimony before the circuit court did not show probable cause.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*110</span> By the 4th amendment to the constitution it is declared "that the right of the people to be secure in their "persons, houses, papers and effects, against unreasonable "searches and seizures, shall not be violated; and "no warrants shall issue, but upon PROBABLE CAUSE "supported by oath or affirmation."</p>
<p>All the facts necessary to constitute this probable cause must appear upon oath or affirmation. It is not necessary indeed that there should be positive proof of every fact constituting the offence; but nothing can be taken into the estimate, when forming an opinion of the probability that the fact was committed by the person charged, but facts supported by oath or affirmation.</p>
<p>No belief of a fact tending to show probable cause, no hearsay, no opinion of any person however high in office, respecting the guilt of the person accused, can be received in evidence on this examination.</p>
<p>The question then is whether these affidavits exhibit legal proof of probable cause.</p>
<p>If the testimony be vague or ambiguous as to the person, or as to the offence, the court will apply the maxim of law, that every person is to be adjudged innocent unless proved to be guilty.</p>
<p>The facts stated in general Wilkinson's two affidavits of the 14th and 26th of December, consist of the letters of col. Burr, the declarations of Swartwout, and the belief of general Wilkinson. Neither the letters of col. Burr, nor the declarations of Swartwout, contain any ground for probable cause to believe that the prisoners, or either of them is guilty of treason; and general Wilkinson's belief, as he himself states, is founded upon those facts.</p>
<p>Mr. Lee, went into a minute examination of those affidavits, to satisfy the court that the facts stated in them could at most prove an intent to set on foot an expedition against Mexico, in case of a war between this country and Spain. He contended that if the object was such an expedition at all events, and if they had intended <span class="star-pagination">*111</span> to force their way through the United States, for the purpose of attacking Mexico, and even if they had done so, they would not have been guilty of treason, but merely of lawless violence. Even if they had plundered the bank at New-Orleans, or any private property, or had seized arms and vessels, the property of individuals, it would have been robbery, but not treason.</p>
<p>But the circumstance that no place of trial can be designated, is a sufficient reason for admitting them to bail. They certainly cannot be tried here, for it is not contended that they have here committed any offence; and this is not the district in which they were first apprehended or brought. They were seized by orders of a military officer 2,000 miles from this place, without any process of law or legal authority, and sent here to be disposed of by the Executive. They have been committed for trial, not before any court, or in any particular district, and their imprisonment will be perpetual, unless government can find out when and where the offence was committed, and devise some means of transmitting them to the place of trial.</p>
<p>Mr. Lee attempted to discredit the affidavits of General Wilkinson by the circumstance that they were made, as he contended, to vindicate and justify the illegal seizure and transportation of the prisoners. He contended also that those affidavits ought to be totally discarded, because the oath upon which a warrant of arrest or commitment is to be grounded, must be made before the magistrate who is about to issue the warrant. He must be satisfied of the probable cause. The laws were open in New-Orleans. General Wilkinson might have gone before a justice of peace there and made his oath, and obtained a warrant to arrest the prisoners. There was no necessity to proceed in this illegal and unprecedented manner.</p>
<p>F.S. Key, on the same side.</p>
<p>Unless this court can look behind the order for commitment, and examine the grounds upon which it was made, the writ of habeas corpus will be wholly useless; for every court or magistrate who commits a person to <span class="star-pagination">*112</span> prison, will take care to cover himself under the strict forms of law.</p>
<p>The constitution declares that treason against the United States shall consist only in levying war against them, or in adhering to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort.</p>
<p>An adherence to rebels, is not an adherence to an enemy within the meaning of the constitution. Hence if the prisoners are guilty, it must be of levying war against the United States.</p>
<p>In England the books speak of two kinds of levying of war; Â— direct and constructive Â— (East's Cr. Law, 67.) But there is only one kind in this country; and ought not to be in England.</p>
<p>By using the word "only" the constitution meant to take away all pretence of constructive treason. Every man is to answer for his own acts only. If 100 men conspire, and only 50 actually levy war, the latter only are guilty as principals.</p>
<p>And what reason can be given why there should not be the same distinction between principal and accessory in treason, as in other crimes. In a republican government, whose basis is the affection of the people, it is unnecessary to guard against offences of this kind with the same vigilance as in a monarchy or a despotism whose foundation is fear. (4 Tucker's Bl. Appendix, p. 39.) But if this construction of the constitution be not correct, and if the English authorities are to be considered in full force, it must be shewn,</p>
<p>1st. That war has been levied Â— and</p>
<p>2d. That the prisoners are confederates in that war.</p>
<p>The affidavits of General Wilkinson are not authenticated so as to make them evidence. It does not appear that an oath was administered to him. The act to prescribe the mode of authenticating public acts, records and judicial proceedings, &amp;c. is extended to the territory <span class="star-pagination">*113</span> of Orleans, by the act erecting that territory. (Vol. 7. p. 117.) And even if this be not strictly a judicial proceeding, yet it is within the meaning of that act.</p>
<p>The certificate of the secretary of state<sup>[*]</sup> only shows that it appears by the official returns to his office, that J. Carrick and George Pollock had been appointed justices of the peace for the county of Orleans; but not that they had taken the oaths necessary to qualify them to act.</p>
<p>But if these affidavits are examinable, they do not show any act of treason. They prove no assemblage of men, no military array. There is not a tittle of evidence that any two men have been seen together with treasonable intent, whether armed or not. The supposed letter from Col. Burr, speaks indeed of choice spirits, but he does not tell us they are invisible spirits.</p>
<p>The affidavits of MÃ©ade and Wilson relate only to rumours derived from General Wilkinson, whose business it was, if he could get such rumours there by no other means, to create them himself.</p>
<p>The territory of Orleans, if it was to be revolutionized, might be revolutionized withot levying war against the United States.</p>
<p>There is no evidence that the prisoners knew that Col. Burr had any treasonable projects in view. Even if he had such views, he might have held out to them, as he did to others, only the Spanish expedition.</p>
<p>Again, the bench-warrant issued in this case for the arrest of the prisoners was illegal. The court has no authority to issue a bench-warrant, but upon a presentment by a grand jury, or for an offence committed in <span class="star-pagination">*114</span> the presence of the court. It is not a power inherent in the court, nor given by any law. The act of congress only gives to a judge out of court, or to a justice of peace, the power of arresting offenders. And it is a power inconsistent with a fair trial, because the court would thereby have prejudged the case, and decided upon the guilt of the prisoner. No such practice is known in Maryland, under whose laws the court below was acting.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>February 17.</h2>
<p>Jones, attorney for the district of Columbia, mentioned to the court, that Hiort, being better prepared upon points of practice, would make some observations in support of the form of the commitment.</p>
<p>MARSHALL, Ch. J. I understand the clear opinion of the court to be, (if I mistake it my brethren will correct me,) that it is unimportant whether the commitment be regular in point of form or not; for this court, having gone into an examination of the evidence upon which the commitment was grounded, will proceed to do that which the court below ought to have done.</p>
<p>Rodney, Attorney General.</p>
<p>The affidavit of General Wilkinson is sufficiently authenticated. The justices of peace in the territory of Orleans are officers of the United States Â— they are appointed by the governor of the territory, who is appointed by the President of the United States; and the secretary of the territory is bound by law to transmit copies of all the executive proceedings of the governor of the territory every six months to the President of the United States. (Laws U.S. vol. 7. p. 112, 113.) All the officers of the United States are bound to take notice of each other.</p>
<p>The act of congress respecting authentication of records, &amp;c. is cumulative only. It does not repeal any former law.</p>
<p>There is some weight in the objection that the oath ought to be made before the magistrate who issues the <span class="star-pagination">*115</span> warrant. But one magistrate is as competent as another to administer the oath. The constitution is silent on the subject; and if it be taken before a person competent to administer it, it satisfies the provision of the constitution. How else could a criminal be arrested in one part of the United States, when the witness lived in another?</p>
<p>It is true that none of the evidence now offered would be competent on the trial; nor even if it appeared in a proper shape, would it be sufficient to convict the prisoners. But the question is whether, in this incipient stage of the prosecution, it is not sufficient to show probable cause.</p>
<p>The expedition against Mexico would not be treason, unless it was to be accomplished by means which in themselves would amount to treason. But if the constituted authorities of the United States should be suppressed but for one hour, and the territory of Orleans revolutionized but for a moment, it would be treason.</p>
<p>What would be treason by adhering to an enemy, if done towards a rebel will be a levying of war. (3 Wilson's Lectures, 105. 4 Bl. Com. 92.)</p>
<p>In treason all are principals. There are no accessories. It has been argued, (and the respectable authority of Judge Tucker is cited,) that none are principals but those present at the treasonable act. The argument may have some weight, but it is a point at least doubtful, and therefore ought to be left to be decided on the trial.</p>
<p>It is true that we cannot at present say exactly when and where the overt act of levying war was committed, but from the affidavits we think it fair to infer that an army has been actually levied and arrayed. The declaration of one of the prisoners was, that Col. Burr "was levying an armed body of 7,000 men." How the fact has turned out to be since we do not know; and it is also true that we do not know that any men have been seen collected in military array. But Dr. Bollman informed General Wilkinson that he had seen a letter from Col. Burr, in which he says that he should be at Natchez <span class="star-pagination">*116</span> with 2,000 men on the 20th of December, and that he would be followed by 4,000 more, and that he could have raised 12,000, as easily as 6,000, but he did not think that number necessary. If Col. Burr was actually levying an armed body of men, if he expected to be at Natches on the 20th of December with 2,000, and calculated upon being followed by 4,000 more, and if he found it so easy to raise troops, is there not a moral certainty that some troops at least have been raised and embodied.</p>
<p>It may be admitted that General Wilkinson was interested to make the worst of the story, but the declarations of the prisoners themselves are sufficient.</p>
<p>Jones, attorney for the district of Columbia, on behalf of the prosecution.</p>
<p>As to the objection that the commitment must be for trial in some court having jurisdiction over the offence.</p>
<p>It was uncertain whether any, and if any, what place was prescribed for the trial of this offence. But any court of the United States had jurisdiction to commit for trial. By the act of congress for the punishment of certain crimes, &amp;c. vol. 1. p. 103. s. 8. "the trial of crimes committed on the high seas, or in any place out of the jurisdiction of any particular state, shall be in the district where the offender is apprehended, or into which he may be first brought." Although the first part of the section speaks of certain crimes committed "upon the high seas, or in any river, haven, bason or bay, out of the jurisdiction of any particular state," yet the last clause of the section is general, and in its terms applies to the trial of all crimes committed out of the jurisdiction of any particular state. This act of congress is the only exercise of the provision of the 3d article of the constitution respecting crimes committed not within any state. Unless this act of congress fixes the place of trial, there is no place prescribed, either by the law or the constitution, and the trial may as well be in the district of Columbia as elsewhere. But if this act of congress does fix the place, then, it is objected, <span class="star-pagination">*117</span> that this district is neither that in which the prisoners were apprehended, nor that into which they were first brought.</p>
<p>The answer is, that the act of congress means the district in which they shall be legally apprehended, that is, arrested by process of law, It could not mean a mere military seizure. But whether the court below had or had not jurisdiction to try the prisoners, it clearly had jurisdiction to commit them; and if their commitment be irregular, this court will say how they ought to be committed. Laws U.S. vol. 1. p. 73. s. 33.</p>
<p>It is objected that, although the judges and justices have power to arrest, yet the courts have not, and therefore cannot issue a bench-warrant but upon the presentment of a grand jury, or for an offence committed in the presence of the court. And the practice of Maryland is cited. But it is stated that at Montgomery Court, in Maryland, very lately a venerable and ancient judge of that court did issue a bench-warrant for an offence not presented by the grand jury, nor committed in presence of the court.<sup>[*]</sup></p>
<p>It is not necessary that the commitment should state the place of trial, nor that they are committed for trial. If at the time of commitment it be uncertain where they ought to be tried, they may be committed generally, until discharged by due course of law. In England it is only necessary that the commitment should be to some jail in England. 2 Hawk. P.C. 120. b. 2. c. 16. s. 18.</p>
<p>As to the authentication of the affidavits of General Wilkinson, it being shewn that Pollock and Carrick were duly appointed justices of the peace, and having <span class="star-pagination">*118</span> undertaken to act as such, it is to be presumed that they have taken the necessary oaths.</p>
<p>It is admitted that the constitution has prevented many questions as to the doctrine of treason. The intention of having a constitutional definition of the crime, was to put it out of the power of congress to invent treasons. But it was impossible to define what should in every case be deemed a levying of war. It is a question of fact to be decided by the jury from all the circumstances.</p>
<p>Warlike array is not necessary. It is only a circumstance. 1 East's Cr. Law, 66. According to the English books, a direct levying of war, is a war directly against the person of the king. A constructive levying of war, is war against the government.</p>
<p>If men have been levied, and arms provided, with a treasonable intent, this is a sufficient levying of war, without warlike array.</p>
<p>The affidavit of General Eaton establishes the treasonable intent in Colonel Burr. The question, then, is, whether that intent, or a knowledge of that intent, can be brought home to the prisoners? Mr. Jones here went into an argument to show the connexion of the prisoners with Colonel Burr, and their knowledge of his projects. He observed that his argument, on a former occasion, respecting the president's message to congress, had been misunderstood. A state of war is a matter of public notoriety, and he had considered the president's message as evidence of that notoriety, it being a communication from the supreme executive, in the course of his duty, to that department of government which alone could decide on the state of war.</p>
<p>He contended that no specific number, no sufficiency of force to accomplish the object, was necessary to constitute treason.</p>
<p>If soldiers are levied and officered, with a treasonable intent, and equipments prepared, so that they can readily lay hold of their arms; although no men are <span class="star-pagination">*119</span> actually armed, although only five men in a detachment should march to assemble at a place of rendezvous, and although there should be no warlike array, yet it would be treason. Any thing which amounts to setting on foot a military expedition, with intent to levy war against the United States, is treason.</p>
<p>The distinction between those who are present at the overt act of levying war, and those who are confederated, adhering, acting and assisting, giving aid and comfort, is contrary to all analogy. In treason, all are principals.</p>
<p>In murder, if two conspire, and one is acting and assisting at such a distance as to give aid, he is equally guilty with him who gave the wound.</p>
<p>It has been insinuated that General Wilkinson is to be considered as particeps criminis. If that were the case, it would be no disqualification of his testimony.</p>
<p>Treason is a greater crime in republics than in monarchies, and ought to be more severely punished.</p>
<p>Harper, in reply, congratulated his country on the triumph of correct principles, in the abandonment, on the part of the prosecution, of the dangerous doctrine, that executive messages were to be received as evidence in a criminal prosecution.</p>
<p>[Jones. The sole purpose for which we introduced the president's message, was to show that the assemblage of a military force by Colonel Burr was a matter of notoriety. We did not attempt or wish to introduce it as direct evidence.]</p>
<p>Harper. To use an executive message in a court of justice, for any purpose of proof whatever, so as to aid in the commitment of a citizen under a criminal accusation; to introduce it as evidence of any fact; (of notoriety, for instance, which is a fact;) is to give it the effect of testimony, and is a direct violation of the constitution.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*120</span> We object to the translation of the ciphered letter contained in General Wilkinson's affidavits, being admitted as evidence, because General Wilkinson has not sworn that it is a true translation, nor sent the original, with the key, so that the court can have a correct translation made. Nor is it proved that the original was written by Colonel Burr, or by his direction, nor that the prisoners were acquainted with its contents.</p>
<p>Another objection to the affidavits is, that they were not made for the purpose of procuring an arrest. They were not made before the judicial officer on whose warrant the proceedings of the court were to be founded; and who would have been bound to cross-examine the witness, to sift the facts, and to judge how far they were proved, and how far they were sufficient to justify the proceedings. But, after a military arrest, the affidavits are drawn up by the author of the arrest, without cross-examination or inquiry, and were sworn to by him, as the justification of his conduct. The persons whom he has thus arrested are sent to a distant part of the country, and these affidavits are sent after them, to operate as the ground of their commitment and detention. No person can lawfully be committed on testimony so taken. In cases of arrests and commitments, the general rules of evidence are no further to be departed from than the necessity of the case requires. On application to a magistrate for a warrant of arrest, the evidence must necessarily be ex parte, but no other departure from the common rules of evidence is justifiable, because not necessary. It is a general rule of law respecting testimony, that it shall be taken before the tribunal which is to act upon it, or under the direction of that tribunal; that the person who is to decide, shall also inquire; that the inquiry shall not be before one tribunal, and the judgment pronounced by another. This rule, so important to the safety of persons accused, is equally applicable to arrests and commitments, as to trials, and should therefore be equally observed. The party arrested and brought before the magistrate for commitment, has a right to be confronted with his accuser, and to cross-examine the witnesses produced against him, and by that means to explain circumstances which, at first view, might criminate him. But if the practice <span class="star-pagination">*121</span> which is attempted in this case be sanctioned by this court; if a military officer, or any other person, is to be permitted to seize a man, and send him 2,000 miles from the place of arrest, and from the place of the alleged transaction, and to send after him an ex parte affidavit as the ground of his subsequent commitment, the great security provided by law for the protection of innocence and liberty is broken down.</p>
<p>Mr. Harper then went into a minute examination of the contents of the affidavits, and contended that, if they could be considered by this court as evidence, they did not prove that treason had been committed, nor that the prisoners had participated in any crime or offence whatever.</p>

<p>Martin, on the same side.</p>
<p>The order for the commitment was erroneous in directing the prisoners to be committed to the prison of the court. It ought to have been to the marshal. 1 Salk. 348. Bethel's case. 5 Mod. 19. S.C.</p>
<p>This court cannot remand them, or commit them, upon this habeas corpus, for any crime but that for which they were committed in the court below; and can only commit them for trial before some court. The only power given by the 33d section of the judiciary act, is to cause offenders to "be arrested; and imprisoned or bailed, as the case may be, for trial before such court of the United States, as by this act has cognizance of the offence." The place of trial is to be decided by the place where the offence was committed.</p>
<p>The act of congress for the punishment of certain crimes, s. 8. vol. 1. p. 103. does not apply to crimes committed in any territory of the United States in which there are courts of the United States having cognizance of the offence. It applies only to offences committed upon the "high seas, or in any river, haven, bason, or bay, out of the jurisdiction of any particular state."</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*122</span> The courts of the United States erected is the territory of Orleans are competent to try the offence of treason against the United States committed within that territory. By the 8th section of the act of congress of 26th March, 1804, vol. 7. p. 117. erecting the territory of Orleans, a district court of the United States is established therein, having all the original powers and jurisdiction of a circuit court of the United States. And by the same act, the "act for the punishment of certain crimes against the United States," is extended to that territory.</p>
<p>It was therefore a wanton and unnecessary exertion of arbitrary power to send the prisoners here, where they cannot be tried. If there is any probability that a crime was committed by the prisoners, it is equally probable that it was committed in the territory of Orleans. It is at all events certain that it was not committed here. The word apprehended, in the act of congress, cannot mean a legal arrest only. If it did, it would be in the power of a military commander to seize a man, and appoint the tribunal by which he shall be tried.</p>
<p>If it is the duty of this court to commit the prisoners for trial, it is equally its duty to bind over the witnesses to appear at the time and place of trial to testify in the case, and to return copies of the process, together with the recognizances of the witnesses, to the office of the clerk of the court having cognizance of the offence. This shows that, upon every commitment, the witnesses must be in the presence of the tribunal committing.</p>
<p>This court cannot commit, unless they first ascertain in what court the trial is to be had.</p>
<p>There is no legal evidence that General Wilkinson ever made oath to his statement. The certificate of the secretary is only that it appears by the return of the secretary of the territory of Orleans, that Pollock and Carrick were justices. A copy of that return ought to be certified.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*123</span> The court, not having made up an opinion, admitted the prisoners to bail until the next day. The Chief Justice stated that the court had difficulty upon two points, viz.</p>
<p>1. Whether the affidavit of General Wilkinson was evidence admissible in this stage of the prosecution; and,</p>
<p>2. Whether, if admissible, his statement of the contents of the substance of a letter, when the original was in his possession, was such evidence as the court ought to notice.</p>
<p>If the counsel had any authorities on these points, the court said they would hear them.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>February 20.</h2>
<p>The Chief Justice asked if the counsel had found any authorities on the points mentioned yesterday.</p>
<p>Rodney, Attorney General, said he had not; but he relied on general principles.</p>
<p>F.S. Key cited 3 T.R. 707. The King v. The Inhabitants of Eriswell, where the principal question was, whether the ex parte examination of the pauper taken before two justices, to whom no application was made for a removal of the pauper, was good evidence before two other justices, five years afterwards, upon an application for his removal, the pauper having in the mean time become insane. The judges of the court of king's bÃ©nch were equally divided. But Grose, J. said, "nothing can be more unjust, than that a person should be bound by evidence which he is not permitted to hear." "The common law did not permit a person accused to be affected by an examination taken in his absence, because he could not cross-examine." Buller, J. who was opposed to Grose, upon the principal question, admitted, "that if the taking the examination were not a judicial act, but was merely coram non judice, it is <span class="star-pagination">*124</span> not evidence," and that "it must be a judicial act at the timÃ¨ it was taken, or cannot become so at all."</p>
<p>Lord Kenyon, Ch. J. said the two justices who took the examination "were not applied to for the purpose of making an order of removal; the overseers called upon them for no other purpose than to examine the pauper; all the proceedings, therefore, were extrajudicial; and the examination on oath might just as well have been taken before the parish clerk, and would have been as much entitled to credit as this."</p>
<p>So in this case we say that, as General Wilkinson did not apply to justices Carrick and Pollock for a warrant to arrest Dr. Bollman and Mr. Swartwout, and as he did not make the affidavit for the purpose of obtaining from them such warrants, the whole proceedings before those justices were extrajudicial. The affidavits are not such as would support an indictment, if false. In the language of Lord Kenyon, they deserve no more credit than if they had been made before the parish clerk. If the affidavit be a judicial proceeding, it ought to be authenticated according to the act of congress. If it be not a judicial proceeding, it is not evidence.</p>
<p>MARSHALL, Ch. J. If a person makes an affidavit before a magistrate to obtain a warrant of arrest, such affidavit must necessarily be ex parte. But how is it on a motion to commit, after the person is taken? Must not the commitment be upon testimony given in presence of the prisoner?</p>
<p>Rodney, Attorney General. The first affidavit would be sufficient, unless disproved or explained by the prisoner on his examination.</p>
<p>Harper. The necessity of the case is the only ground of an exception to the general rule of evidence; and that necessity ceases when the party is taken.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>
<span class="star-pagination">*125</span> February 21.</h2>
<p>MARSHALL, Ch. J.<sup>[*]</sup> delivered the opinion of the court.</p>
<p>The prisoners having been brought before this court on a writ of habeas corpus, and the testimony on which they were committed having been fully examined and attentively considered, the court is now to declare the law upon their case.</p>
<p>This being a mere inquiry, which, without deciding upon guilt, precedes the institution of a prosecution, the question to be determined is, whether the accused shall be discharged or held to trial; and if the latter, in what place they are to be tried, and whether they shall be confined or admitted to bail. "If," says a very learned and accurate commentator, "upon this inquiry it manifestly appears that no such crime has been committed, or that the suspicion entertained of the prisoner was wholly groundless, in such cases only is it lawful totally to discharge him. Otherwise he must either be committed to prison or give bail."</p>
<p>The specific charge brought against the prisoners is treason in levying war against the United States.</p>
<p>As there is no crime which can more excite and agitate the passions of men than treason, no charge demands more from the tribunal before which it is made a deliberate and temperate inquiry. Whether this inquiry be directed to the fact or to the law, none can be more solemn, none more important to the citizen or to the government; none can more affect the safety of both.</p>
<p>To prevent the possibility of those calamities which result from the extension of treason to offences of minor <span class="star-pagination">*126</span> importance, that great fundamental law which defines and limits the various departments of our government has given a rule on the subject both to the legislature and the courts of America, which neither can be permitted to transcend.</p>
<p>"Treason against the United States shall consist only in levying war against them, or in adhering to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort."</p>
<p>To cÃ³nstitute that specific crime for which the prisoners now before the court have been committed, war must be actually levied against the United States. However flagitious may be the crime of conspiring to subvert by force the government of our country, such conspiracy is not treason. To conspire to levy war, and actually to levy war, are distinct offences. The first must be brought into operation by the assemblage of men for a purpose treasonable in itself, or the fact of levying war cannot have been committed. So far has this principle been carried, that, in a case reported by Ventris, and mentioned in some modern treatises on criminal law, it has been determined that the actual enlistment of men to serve against the government does not amount to levying war. It is true that in that case the soldiers enlisted were to serve without the realm, but they were enlisted within it, and if the enlistment for a treasonable purpose could amount to levying war, then war had been actually levied.</p>
<p>It is not the intention of the court to say that no individual can be guilty of this crime who has not appeared in arms against his country. On the contrary, if war be actually levied, that is, if a body of men be actually assembled for the purpose of effecting by force a treasonable purpose, all those who perform any part, however minute, or however remote from the scene of action, and who are actually leagued in the general conspiracy, are to be considered as traitors. But there must be an actual assembling of men for the treasonable purpose, to constitute a levying of war.</p>
<p>Crimes so atrocious as those which have for their object the subversion by violence of those laws and those <span class="star-pagination">*127</span> institutions which have been ordained in order to secure the peace and happiness of society, are not to escape punishment because they have not ripened into treason. The wisdom of the legislature is competent to provide for the case; and the framers of our constitution, who not only defined and limited the crime, but with jealous circumspection attempted to protect their limitation by providing that no person should be convicted of it, unless on the testimony of two witnesses to the same overt act, or on confession in open court, must have conceived it more safe that punishment in such cases should be ordained by general laws, formed upon deliberation, under the influence of no resentments, and without knowing on whom they were to operate, than that it should be inflicted under the influence of those passions which the occasion seldom fails to excite, and which a flexible definition of the crime, or a construction which would render it flexible, might bring into operation. It is therefore more safe as well as more consonant to the principles of our constitution, that the crime of treason should not be extended by construction to doubtful cases; and that crimes not clearly within the constitutional definition, should receive such punishment as the legislature in its wisdom may provide.</p>
<p>To complete the crime of levying war against the United States, there must be an actual assemblage of men for the purpose of executing a treasonable design. In the case now before the court, a design to overturn the government of the United States in New-Orleans by force, would have been unquestionably a design which, if carried into execution, would have been treason, and the assemblage of a body of men for the purpose of carrying it into execution would amount to levying of war against the United States; but no conspiracy for this object, no enlisting of men to effect it, would be an actual levying of war.</p>
<p>In conformity with the principles now laid down, have been the decisions heretofore made by the judges of the United States.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*128</span> The opinions given by Judge Paterson and Judge Iredell, in cases before them, imply an actual assembling of men, though they rather designed to remark on the purpose to which the force was to be applied than on the nature of the force itself. Their opinions, however, contemplate the actual employment of force.</p>
<p>Judge Chase, in the trial of Fries, was mere explicit.</p>
<p>He stated the opinion of the court to be, "that if a body of people conspire and meditate an insurrection to resist or oppose the execution of any statute of the United States by force, they are only guilty of a high misdemeanor; but if they proceed to carry such intention into execution by force, that they are guilty of the treason of levying war; and the quantum of the force employed, neither lessens nor increases the crime: whether by one hundred, or one thousand persons, is wholly immaterial." "The court are of opinion," continued Judge Chase, on that occasion, "that a combination or conspiracy to levy war against the United States is not treason, unless combined with an attempt to carry such combination or conspiracy into execution; some actual force or violence must be used in pursuance of such design to levy war; but it is altogether immaterial whether the force used is sufficient to effectuate the object; any force connected with the intention will constitute the crime of levying war."</p>
<p>The application of these general principles to the particular case before the court will depend on the testimony which has been exhibited against the accused.</p>
<p>The first deposition to be considered is that of General Eaton. This gentleman connects in one statement the purport of numerous conversations held with Colonel Burr throughout the last winter. In the course of these conversations were communicated various criminal projects which seem to have been revolving in the mind of the projector. An expedition against Mexico seems to have been the first and most matured part of his plan, if indeed it did not constitute a distinct and separate plan, <span class="star-pagination">*129</span> upon the success of which other schemes still more culpable, but not yet well digested, might depend. Maps and other information preparatory to its execution, and which would rather indicate that it was the immediate object, had been procured, and for a considerable time, in repeated conversations, the whole efforts of Colonel Burr were directed to prove to the witness, who was to have held a high command under him, the practicability of the enterprize, and in explaining to him the means by which it was to be effected.</p>
<p>This deposition exhibits the various schemes of Col. Burr, and its materiality depends on connecting the prisoners at the bar in such of those schemes as were treasonable. For this purpose the affidavit of General Wilkinson, comprehending in its body the substance of a letter from Colonel Burr, has been offered, and was received by the circuit court. To the admission of this testimony great and serious objections have been made. It has been urged that it is a voluntary or rather an extrajudicial affidavit, made before a person not appearing to be a magistrate, and contains the substance only of a letter, of which the original is retained by the person who made the affidavit.</p>
<p>The objection that the affidavit is extrajudicial resolves itself into the question whether one magistrate may commit on an affidavit taken before another magistrate. For if he may, an affidavit made as the foundation of a commitment ceases to be extrajudicial, and the person who makes it would be as liable to a prosecution for perjury as if the warrant of commitment had been issued by the magistrate before whom the affidavit was made.</p>
<p>To decide that an affidavit made before one magistrate would not justify a commitment by another, might in many cases be productive of great inconvenience, and does not appear susceptible of abuse if the verity of the certificate be established. Such an affidavit seems admissible on the principle that before the accused is put upon his trial all the proceedings are ex parte. The court therefore overrule this objection.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*130</span> That which questions the character of the person who has on this occasion administered the oath is next to be considered.</p>
<p>The certificate from the office of the department of state has been deemed insufficient by the counsel for the prisoners, because the law does not require the appointment of magistrates for the territory of New-Orleans to be certified to that office, because the certificate is in itself informal, and because it does not appear that the magistrate had taken the oath required by the act of congress.</p>
<p>The first of these objections is not supported by the law of the case, and the second may be so readily corrected, that the court has proceeded to consider the subject as if it were corrected, retaining however any final decision, if against the prisoners, until the correction shall be made. With regard to the third, the magistrate must be presumed to have taken the requisite oaths, since he is found acting as a magistrate.</p>
<p>On the admissibility of that part of the affidavit which purports to be as near the substance of the letter from Colonel Burr to General Wilkinson as the latter could interpret it, a division of opinion has taken place in the court. Two judges are of opinion that as such testimony delivered in the presence of the prisoner on his trial would be totally inadmissible, neither can it be considered as a foundation for a commitment. Although in making a commitment the magistrate does not decide on the guilt of the prisoner, yet he does decide on the probable cause, and a long and painful imprisonment may be the consequence of his decision. This probable cause, therefore, ought to be proved by testimony in itself legal, and which, though from the nature of the case it must be ex parte, ought in many other respects to be such as a court and jury might hear.</p>
<p>Two judges are of opinion that in this incipient stage of the prosecution an affidavit stating the general purport of a letter may be read, particularly where the person in possession of it is at too great a distance to admit of <span class="star-pagination">*131</span> its being obtained, and that a commitment may be founded on it.</p>
<p>Under this embarrassment it was deemed necessary to look into the affidavit for the purpose of discovering whether, if admitted, it contains matter which would justify the commitment of the prisoners at the bar on the charge of treason.</p>
<p>That the letter from Colonel Burr to General Wilkinson relates to a military enterprize meditated by the former, has not been questioned. If this enterprize was against Mexico, it would amount to a high misdemeanor; if against any of the territories of the United States, or if in its progress the subversion of the government of the United States in any of their territories was a mean clearly and necessarily to be employed, if such mean formed a substantive part of the plan, the assemblage of a body of men to effect it would be levying war against the United States.</p>
<p>The letter is in language which furnishes no distinct view of the design of the writer. The co-operation, however, which is stated to have been secured, points strongly to some expedition against the territories of Spain. After making these general statements, the writer becomes rather more explicit, and says, "Burr's plan of operations is to move down rapidly from the falls on the 15th of November with the first 500 or 1,000 men in light boats now constructing for that purpose, to be at Natchez between the 5th and 15th of December, there to meet Wilkinson; then to determine whether it will be expedient in the first instance to seize on or to pass by Baton Rouge. The people of the country to which we are going are prepared to receive us. Their agents now with Burr say that if we will protect their religion, and will not subject them to a foreign power, in three weeks all will be settled."</p>
<p>There is no expression in these sentences which would justify a suspicion that any territory of the United States was the object of the expedition.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*132</span> For what purpose seize on Baton Rouge; why engage Spain against this enterprize, if it was designed against the United States?</p>
<p>"The people of the country to which we are going are prepared to receive us." This language is peculiarly appropriate to a foreign country. It will not be contended that the terms would be inapplicable to a territory of the United States, but other terms would more aptly convey the idea, and Burr seems to consider himself as giving information of which Wilkinson was not possessed. When it is recollected that he was the governor of a territory adjoining that which must have been threatened, if a territory of the United States was threatened, and that he commanded the army, a part of which was stationed in that territory, the probability that the information communicated related to a foreign country, it must be admitted, gains strength.</p>
<p>"Their agents now with Burr say, that if we will protect their religion, and will not subject them to a foreign power, in three weeks all will be settled."</p>
<p>This is apparently the language of a people who, from the contemplated change in their political situation, feared for their religion, and feared that they would be made the subjects of a foreign power. That the Mexicans should entertain these apprehensions was natural, and would readily be believed. They were, if the representation made of their dispositions be correct, about to place themselves much in the power of men who professed a different faith from theirs, and who, by making them dependent on England or the United States, would subject them to a foreign power.</p>
<p>That the people of New-Orleans, as a people, if really engaged in the conspiracy, should feel the same apprehensions, and require assurances on the same points, is by no means so obvious.</p>
<p>There certainly is not in the letter delivered to Gen. Wilkinson, so far as that letter is laid before the court, one syllable which has a necessary or a natural reference <span class="star-pagination">*133</span> to an enterprize against any territory of the United States.</p>
<p>That the bearer of this letter must be considered as acquainted with its contents is not to be controverted. The letter and his own declarations evince the fact.</p>
<p>After stating himself to have passed through New-York, and the western states and territories, without insinuating that he had performed on his route any act whatever which was connected with the enterprize, he states their object to be, "to carry an expedition into the Mexican provinces."</p>
<p>This statement may be considered as explanatory of the letter of Col. Burr, if the expressions of that letter could be thought ambiguous.</p>
<p>But there are other declarations made by Mr. Swartwout, which constitute the difficulty of this case. On an inquiry from General Wilkinson, he said, "this territory would be revolutionized where the people were ready to join them, and that there would be some seizing, he supposed, at New-Orleans."</p>
<p>If these words import that the government established by the United States in any of its territories, was to be revolutionized by force, although merely as a step to, or a mean of executing some greater projects, the design was unquestionably treasonable, and any assemblage of men for that purpose would amount to a levying of war. But on the import of the words a difference of opinion exists. Some of the judges suppose they refer to the territory against which the expedition was intended; others to that in which the conversation was held. Some consider the words, if even applicable to a territory of the United States, as alluding to a revolution to be effected by the people, rather than by the party conducted by Col. Burr.</p>
<p>But whether this treasonable intention be really imputable to the plan or not, it is admitted that it must have been carried into execution by an open assemblage of <span class="star-pagination">*134</span> men for that purpose, previous to the arrest of the prisoner, in order to consummate the crime as to him; and a majority of the court is of opinion that the conversation of Mr. Swartwout affords no sufficient proof of such assembling.</p>
<p>The prisoner stated that "Col. Burr, with the support of a powerful association extending from New-York to New-Orleans, was levying an armed body of 7,000 men from the state of New-York and the western states and territories, with a view to carry an expedition to the Mexican territories."</p>
<p>That the association, whatever may be its purpose, is not treason, has been already stated. That levying an army may or may not be treason, and that this depends on the intention with which it is levied, and on the point to which the parties have advanced, has been also stated. The mere enlisting of men, without assembling them, is not levying war. The question then is, whether this evidence proves Col. Burr to have advanced so far in levying an army as actually to have assembled them.</p>
<p>It is argued that since it cannot be necessary that the whole 7,000 men should have assembled, their commencing their march by detachments to the place of rendezvous must be sufficient to constitute the crime.</p>
<p>This position is correct, with some qualification. It cannot be necessary that the whole army should assemble, and that the various parts which are to compose it should have combined. But it is necessary that there should be an actual assemblage, and therefore the evidence should make the fact unequivocal.</p>
<p>The travelling of individuals to the place of rendezvous would perhaps not be sufficient. This would be an equivocal act, and has no warlike appearance. The meeting of particular bodies of men, and their marching from places of partial to a place of general rendezvous, would be such an assemblage.</p>
<p>The particular words used by Mr. Swartwout are, that Col. Burr "was levying an armed body of 7,000 men." <span class="star-pagination">*135</span> If the term levying in this place imports that they were assembled, then such fact would amount, if the intention be against the United States, to levying war. If it barely imports that he was enlisting or engaging them in his service, the fact would not amount to levying war.</p>
<p>It is thought sufficiently apparent that the latter is the sense in which the term was used. The fact alluded to, if taken in the former sense, is of a nature so to force itself upon the public view, that if the army had then actually assembled, either together or in detachments, some evidence of such assembling would have been laid before the court.</p>
<p>The words used by the prisoner in reference to seizing at New-Orleans, and borrowing perhaps by force from the bank, though indicating a design to rob, and consequently importing a high offence, do not designate the specific crime of levying war against the United States.</p>
<p>It is therefore the opinion of a majority of the court, that in the case of Samuel Swartwout there is not sufficient evidence of his levying war against the United States to justify his commitment on the charge of treason.</p>
<p>Against Erick Bollman there is still less testimony. Nothing has been said by him to support the charge that the enterprize in which he was engaged had any other object than was stated in the letter of Colonel Burr. Against him, therefore, there is no evidence to support a charge of reason.</p>
<p>That both of the prisoners were engaged in a most culpable enterprize against the dominions of a power at peace with the United States, those who admit the affidavit of General Wilkinson cannot doubt. But that no part of this crime was committed in the district of Columbia is apparent. It is therefore the unanimous opinion of the court that they cannot be tried in this district.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*136</span> The law read on the part of the prosecution is understood to apply only to offences committed on the high seas, or in any river, haven, bason or bay, not within the jurisdiction of any particular state. In those cases there is no court which has particular cognizance of the crime, and therefore the place in which the criminal shall be apprehended, or, if he be apprehended where no court has exclusive jurisdiction, that to which he shall be first brought, is substituted for the place in which the offence was committed.</p>
<p>But in this case, a tribunal for the trial of the offence, wherever it may have been committed, had been provided by congress; and at the place where the prisoners were seized by the authority of the commander in chief, there existed such a tribunal. It would, too, be extremely dangerous to say, that because the prisoners were apprehended, not by a civil magistrate, but by the military power, there could be given by law a right to try the persons so seized in any place which the general might select, and to which he might direct them to be carried.</p>
<p>The act of congress which the prisoners are supposed to have violated, describes as offenders those who begin or set on foot, or provide, or prepare, the means for any military expedition or enterprize to be carried on from thence against the dominions of a foreign prince or state, with whom the United States are at peace.</p>
<p>There is a want of precision in the description of the offence which might produce some difficulty in deciding what cases would come within it. But several other questions arise which a court consisting of four judges finds itself unable to decide, and therefore, as the crime with which the prisoners stand charged has not been committed, the court can only direct them to be discharged. This is done with the less reluctance because the discharge does not acquit them from the offence which there is probable cause for supposing they have committed, and if those whose duty it is to protect the nation, by prosecuting offenders against the laws, shall suppose <span class="star-pagination">*137</span> those who have been charged with treason to be proper objects for punishment, they will, when possessed of less exceptionable testimony, and when able to say at what place the offence has been committed, institute fresh proceedings against them.</p>

<p><span class="star-pagination">*143</span> Harper, for plaintiff in error.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*153</span> MARSHALL, Ch. J. delivered the opinion of the court.</p>
<p>The material question in this case is, whether a person who indorses a promissory note for the accommodation of the drawer, be discharged from the responsibility which the indorsement creates, by the failure of the holder to demand payment of the maker in the usual time, and to give notice to the indorser that the note is not paid.</p>
<p>That by the general rule of law the omission to demand payment from the maker when the note becomes payable, and to give notice to the indorser that payment has been refused, discharges the indorser, is admitted; <span class="star-pagination">*154</span> but from this general rule of law exceptions exist, and the counsel for the defendants in error contend that the case stated is comprehended in one of these exceptions.</p>
<p>It is laid down as an exception to the general rule, in its application to bills of exchange, that if the drawer has no effects in the hands of the drawee, notice of the dishonour of the bill may be dispensed with, and the case of an indorser of a promissory note for the accommodation of the maker, is said to come within the same reason and the same law.</p>
<p>The correctness of this position will be best tested by considering the reason of the rule, and the reason or the exception.</p>
<p>Why is it that notice must immediately be given to the drawer that his bill is dishonoured by the drawee? It is because he is presumed to have effects in the hands of the drawee, in consequence of which the drawee ought to pay the bill, and that he may sustain an injury by acting on the presumption that the bill is actually paid. The law requires this notice, not merely as an indemnity against actual injury, but as a security against a possible injury which may result from the laches of the holder of the bill. To this security, then, it would seem, the drawer ought to remain entitled, unless his case be such as to take him out of the reason of the rule.</p>
<p>A drawer who has no effects in the hands of the drawee, is said to be without the reason of the rule, and therefore to form an exception to it.</p>
<p>This has been laid down in the books as a positive qualification of the rule, but has seldom been so laid down, except in cases where, in point of fact, the drawer had no right to expect that his bill would be honoured, and could sustain no injury by the neglect of the holder to give notice of its being dishonoured. In reason it would seem, that in such cases only can the exception be admitted, and that the necessity of notice ought to be dispensed with only in those cases where <span class="star-pagination">*155</span> notice must be unnecessary, or immaterial to the drawer.</p>
<p>The reasoning of the judges, in most of the cases which have been cited, would seem to warrant this restriction of the exception.</p>
<p>The case of Bikerdike v. Bollman was a bill drawn by a debtor on his creditor, without a single accompanying circumstance which could raise an expectation that the bill would be accepted or paid. Notice in this case was declared to be unnecessary. Justice Ashhurst gives as a reason for this opinion, that the drawing was in itself a fraud. This reason must be considered as additional to the general ground on which the case was placed in the argument, which was, that the want of notice could not possibly affect the drawer. The particular reason given by Justice Ashhurst for his opinion, is clearly inapplicable to any case in which the drawer was justified in drawing.</p>
<p>Into the opinion of Justice Buller, some general reasoning is introduced, from which it is fairly deducible that he considered the drawer as having no right to expect that the bill would be paid, and as being liable to no injury from the want of notice, and that these were the true grounds of the exception.</p>
<p>He says, "If it be proved on the part of the plaintiff, that from the time the bill was drawn, till the time it became due, the drawee never had any effects of the drawer in his hands, I think notice to the drawer is not necessary; for he must know whether he had effects in the hands of the drawee or not; and if he had none, he had no right to draw upon him and to expect payment from him; nor can he be injured by the non-payment of the bill, or the want of notice that it has been dishonoured."</p>
<p>These observations were, in fact, applicable to the case, for the drawer was the debtor of the drawee, and had no right to draw the bill, nor reason to expect that it would be accepted.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*156</span> This principle was recognized in Goodall et al. v. Dolly, in which the same idea, so far as respects the impossibility of injury to the drawer, was repeated.</p>
<p>This point came on again to be considered in the case of Rogers v. Stephens, 2 T.R. 713. in which, as between the drawer and drawee, there was no pretext of a right to draw. It was said that a third person had stated himself to have funds in the hands of the drawee; that the bill was really drawn on the credit of those funds, and that loss had been actually sustained from the want of notice. But these facts formed no part of the case. If they had, it is apparent that, in the opinions of Lord Kenyon and Justice Grose, they would have been decisive in favour of the necessity of notice, unless that necessity had been dispensed with by the subsequent conduct of the drawer. Lord Kenyon states the reason why notice need not be given to the person who draws without funds in the hands of the drawee to be, "because the drawer must know that he had no right to draw on the drawee." The opinions of Lord Kenyon and Justice Grose in this respect, though not assented to, were not controverted by Justice Ashhurst.</p>
<p>The decision in Rogers v. Stephens was made on the authority of Bikerdike v. Bollman.</p>
<p>It would seem to be the fair construction of these cases, that a person having a right to draw in consequence of engagements between himself and the drawee, or in consequence of consignments made to the drawee, or from any other cause, ought to be considered as drawing upon funds in the hands of the drawee, and therefore, as not coming within the exception to the general rule.</p>
<p>The transaction cannot be denominated a fraud, for in such case it is a fair commercial transaction.</p>
<p>Neither can it be truly said that he had no right to expect his bill would be paid, for a person authorised to draw must expect his draft will be honoured.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*157</span> Neither can it be said that he has virtual notice of the protest, and that actual notice is useless, and the want of it can do him no injury; for this is only true when at the time of drawing the drawer has no reason to expect that his bill will be paid.</p>
<p>A person having a right to draw, and a fair right to expect that his bill will be honoured, would not come within the reason of the exception, and therefore, it may well be contended, ought not to be brought within the exception itself.</p>
<p>This doctrine appears to be contradicted in the case of Walwyn v. St. Quintin.</p>
<p>In that case the bill was drawn to accommodate the indorser, who had previously placed securities, on which he wished to raise money, in the hands of the acceptor; but the drawer had no effects in his hands. It was determined that, in this case, notice to the drawer was unnecessary.</p>
<p>If this determination should be considered without examining the reasoning on which it was founded, the reader would conclude that the single circumstance of drawing without funds in the hands of the drawee belonging to the drawer, subjected him, without notice, to the payment of his bill, if dishonoured, at any period of time when not barred by the act of limitations; and that no demonstration of his perfect right to draw, or of the loss to which the want of notice had exposed him could relieve him from the claim of the holder of the bill. For in this case the drawee having accepted on funds, the drawer had a right to expect that the bill would be paid, could not be chargeable with fraud in drawing, nor required to prepare other funds to prevent the disgrace and injury of his bill's being dishonoured, or to take measures to secure himself against the acceptor or indorser. He does not appear to have come within any one reason assigned in the cases of Bikerdike v. Bollman, or of Rogers v. Stephens, for the exception stated in those cases to the general rule.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*158</span> This induces the necessity of examining with particular attention the reasons given by the judge, which must be considered as explanatory of the decision.</p>
<p>In delivering the opinion of the court, Lord Chief Justice Eyre said, "The true fact is, that this was the acceptor's bill, and not the drawer's." "The transaction in this case was a mode by which the acceptor advanced a sum of money to the payee, and the drawer was a mere instrument of the acceptor." "It seems clear, that notice can be of no use to him, his situation being this, that if the acceptor do not pay, he must, and may then, and not till then, resort to the acceptor to be reimbursed. Notice, therefore, can amount to nothing, for his situation cannot be changed."</p>
<p>It is observable that the principle supposed to be laid down in the cases previously adjudged as constituting the reason for the exception is here expressly recognized, and forms the great and operative motive for the judgment of the court. It is, that notice could be of no use, that the drawer could not avail himself of it, that he could take no step which would in any manner change his situation, that he could have no recourse against the acceptor until he paid the bill.</p>
<p>In no case is the reason of the exception more explicitly given, and the only difficulty is to apply the reasoning to the facts as reported.</p>
<p>The court seem to have supposed, that since the drawer could not maintain an action against the acceptor until he had taken up the bill, that it was perfectly useless to enable him, by proper notice, to employ those other various means which he might have taken to secure himself. Such is not the reasoning of the judges in the cases previously decided; and this reasoning certainly would not be permitted to apply to an indorser who had given value for the bill, not knowing that it was drawn without funds in the hands of the drawee. Yet he would be unable to recover from the drawer until he had taken up the bill.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*159</span> If an action could not have been maintained, might not the drawer have effects of the drawee in his hands which he might retain; or might not various other means of saving himself be neglected, in consequence of the opinion that the bill would be paid? If this might be, how can it be true that notice can be of no use to him?</p>
<p>If the fact even be that the drawer could only sue the acceptor in such a case as this, after having himself discharged the bill, still he ought to have notice, that he might immediately take it up for the purpose of proceeding against the acceptor.</p>
<p>The reasoning of Lord Chief Justice Eyre, to be perfectly consistent with itself and with the principles laid down in previous decisions, would seem to be predicated on an understanding on the part of the drawer when the bill was drawn, that it was not to be paid by the acceptor; or on the idea that a bill drawn without funds is not a commercial transaction, and not subject to commercial rules.</p>
<p>The presumptions are rendered the stronger from the cases afterwards stated, in which a drawer without funds in the hands of his drawee would still be entitled to notice. These are "acceptances on the faith of consignments from the drawer not come to hand," and "acceptances on the ground of fair mercantile agreement;" to which, he says, may possibly be added many others.</p>
<p>If the exception admits of these exceptions and of many others, it would be difficult to apply it to any case of a fair transaction, where the drawer had really a right to draw, unless it be supposed not to be governed by the law merchant.</p>
<p>The judge next proceeds to describe the case in which notice is not requisite.</p>
<p>He says, "Where the drawer has no effects, and has no fair pretence for drawing, or where he draws without effects intended to be applied in payment, and only <span class="star-pagination">*160</span> for the purpose of raising money by discount for himself, and a fortiori for the acceptor, it is fairly deducible from the cases that notice need not be given."</p>
<p>It is not only necessary that the drawer should have no effects, but also that he should have no fair pretence for drawing. Now he may have a fair pretence, as in the case of a "fair mercantile agreement," without having any funds in the hands of the drawee, which notice of non-acceptance of the bill might enable him to withdraw; and yet in such case it would appear, from the language of the court, that notice could not be dispensed with.</p>
<p>"Where he draws only for the purpose of raising money by discount for himself, and a fortiori for the acceptor," notice need not be given.</p>
<p>Where he draws solely for the purpose of raising money by discount for himself, he expects to pay the bill, and there is no person to whom he can resort for repayment. There is no person on whom he can have a legal or an equitable demand, in consequence of the non-payment of the bill. But how can the same reasoning be said to apply a fortiori to the case of the bill being drawn for the use of the acceptor? In such case the relative situation of the parties must be substantially the same as if the money raised on the bill for the acceptor, were funds of the drawer in his hands, on which the bill was drawn. Every motive for requiring notice of non-payment, in the case of a bill drawn upon funds, except that which results from a right to claim those funds by a suit, would apply to a bill drawn to raise money for the acceptor, unless it was understood at the time that the acceptor was not to pay the bill.</p>
<p>The case of Warwyn v. St. Quintin, then, can only be supported on the idea of an understanding that the drawee was not to pay the bill, or that a bill, drawn, not in the usual course of business, is a transaction to which commercial rules do not apply.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*161</span> In the case of Whitfield v. Savage, (2 Bos. &amp; Pul. 277.) the drawer had funds in the hands of the acceptor, and the decision turned upon that point.</p>
<p>The reasoning on the cases of protested bills has been gone into the more at large, because it has been considered as applicable to promissory notes indorsed under the statute of Anne, which is admitted to be in force in Maryland.</p>
<p>The indorser has been considered as the drawer, and the maker of the note as the acceptor; and in all cases of an indorsement for accommodation, the indorser is likened to a drawer without funds in the hands of the acceptor.</p>
<p>Where the money raised upon the note is received by the indorser, so that the note is discounted, in truth, for his accommodation, not for that of the maker, he is unquestionably without funds in the hands of the acceptor, must expect to pay the note himself, and cannot require notice of its non-payment by the maker. But the same reasons do not appear to exist where the note has been discounted for the maker. In that case the funds which represent the note are in the hands of the maker, or, to use the language applicable to bills, in the hands of the acceptor before the draft becomes payable; the drawer had a right to draw, and had a right to expect that his bill would be paid. Upon principles of reason and of justice, then, it would seem that notice of non-payment could as little be dispensed with in this case, as if he had himself paid the money to the maker of the note, and then received it from the bank, or as if the note had been given him for a previous debt, and had been discounted for his own use.</p>
<p>Notice of non-payment by the maker is necessary, because the undertaking of the indorser is conditional, and wherever, in fact, the transaction is such that the maker of the note ought in justice to pay it, and is bound ultimately to make it good, it would seem reasonable that payment should be demanded from him, and that reasonable notice of non-payment should be given to the indorser.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*162</span> If, however, the course of decisions be otherwise, the indorser of a note for the accommodation of the maker must come within the exception which dispenses with notice in his case.</p>
<p>The cases which have been adjudged in England on promissory notes, are anterior, in point of time, to the cases of Walwyn v. St. Quintin, and of Whitfield v. Savage.</p>
<p>The first which has been cited is De Berdt v. Atkinson. This note was indorsed for the accommodation of the maker, the indorser well knowing at the time that the maker was insolvent. Four judges who tried the cause were unanimously of opinion, that want of notice did not discharge the indorser. The opinion of the Chief Justice was founded on the known insolvency of the maker, and the consequent impossibility that loss could be sustained by the indorser from want of notice. The opinion of Justice Buller was founded on the circumstance that the note was indorsed for the accommodation of the drawer. He states explicitly, that the general rule is only applicable to fair transactions, and by fair transactions he means "bills or notes given for value in the ordinary course of trade."</p>
<p>Justices Heath and Rookc accorded in the decision, but whether for the reasons assigned by the Chief Justice, or for those assigned by Justice Buller, or for both, does not appear.</p>
<p>The same point came on to be considered in the case of Nicholson v. Gouthit.</p>
<p>This was a strong case, because the indorsement was made in consequence of a previous engagement on the part of the indorser to guarantee the payment of a debt due from the maker of the note, who appears, from the transaction, to have been in bad circumstances at the time, and who became insolvent before the note was payable. From his connection with the maker, and from other circumstances, the indorser must have known that the maker would not pay the note, and it was the <span class="star-pagination">*163</span> understanding of all parties that it should be paid by the indorser.</p>
<p>The justice of the case was said to be clearly in favour of the plaintiff, and under an impression that the want of notice in this case could not injure the plaintiff, the Lord Chief Justice had at the trial instructed the jury that it was unnecessary, and indeed that it might be considered as received by anticipation.</p>
<p>In this case the note was not made merely to raise money, but was made to pay a debt. The indorser, however, gave no value for it, and, if likened to the drawer of a bill of exchange, he had drawn without funds in the hands of the acceptor, and with a knowledge that the acceptor would not pay the bill.</p>
<p>But in the argument in favour of a new trial, the counsel contended that the law upon a promissory note was different, in this respect, from the law on a bill of exchange, and though notice of the dishonour of a bill drawn without funds in the hands of the drawee need not be given, yet the rule in the case of promissory notes is totally different, and notice must in all cases be given to the indorser.</p>
<p>In delivering the opinion of the court, Lord Chief Justice Eyre assented to this distinction, and admitted the rule with respect to notice to the indorser, to be as stated. He therefore reversed his own decision at Nisi Prius, and granted a new trial upon the strict law, contrary to his ideas of the justice of the case.</p>
<p>Heath and Rooke concurred in this opinion. Buller was not present, and reasoning from his opinion in the case of De Berdt v. Atkinson, it is probable he would not have concurred in the decision of this case.</p>
<p>However, then, the law may be with regard to the drawer of a bill of exchange who from other circumstances may fairly draw, but who has no effects in the hands of the drawer, it seems settled in England, by the case of Nicholson v. Gouthit, that the law with regard to a promissory note is different, and that, if in <span class="star-pagination">*164</span> any case where the notice is made for the benefit of the maker, notice to the indorser can be dispensed with, it is only in the case of an insolvency known at the time of indorsement.</p>
<p>In point of reason, justice, and the nature of the undertaking, there is no case in which the indorser is better entitled to demand strict notice than in the case of an indorsement for accommodation, the maker having received the value.</p>
<p>This court is of opinion that the circuit court erred in directing the jury that the laches of the plaintiffs, in failing to demand payment of the maker of the note, and to give notice of non-payment to the indorser, did not deprive the plaintiffs of their remedy against the indorser, and therefore the judgment rendered in this case is reversed, and the cause remanded for further trial. A new trial, with instructions, &amp;c.</p>
<p>Judgment reversed.</p>

</div>
<div class="num" id="p3">
<span class="num">3</span>
<p class="indent">Skillern put into the hands of Richard May several land-warrants to locate in Kentucky, under an agreement that May should have half the land for locating the whole, who accordingly located the quantity of 2,500 acres in the name of Skillern, but not to his satisfaction, and the matter was not settled between them as the time of R. May's death, when his interest in the lands so located descended to his son, John May, the defendants' testator. Skillern afterwards came to an agreement with John May, on the 6th of March, 1785, by which Skillern was to assign to J. May one military warrant for 200 acres of land, and all the treasury warrants located in the name of Skillern, with the entries and locations made thereon, which assignment was on the same day executed, but never lodged in the land-office, or the office of the surveyor of the county where the lands were situated. In consideration of this assignment, and in full of all demands by Skillern against the representatives of R. May's estate, John May gave to Skillern a bond, dated March 6th, 1785, to convey to Skillern 1,000 acres of the land to which R. May was entitled at his death, and which remained unsurveyed, to be chosen by Skillern before the 15th of June, 1786. It was also agreed by another writing of the same date, that if Skillern would give up the bond for 1,000 acres, John May should convey to him 1,100 acres of other land described in the writing, and Skillern was to make his election of the one or the other before the 1st of October, 1786. This last agreement was afterwards cancelled, and a bond in lieu thereof given by J. May to Skillern, dated October the 9th, 1787, to convey to the latter, on or before the 1st of December, 1788, 'eleven hundred acres of first rate elk-horn land, well watered, and lying within ten miles of Lexington.'</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p4">
<span class="num">4</span>
<p class="indent">Skillern, notwithstanding the assignment of his military and treasury warrants to J. May, afterwards obtained patents thereon for 1,050 acres, of the value of 4,416 dollars 66 cents.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p5">
<span class="num">5</span>
<p class="indent">There was no evidence that Skillern ever offered to convey those lands to May, or his representatives.</p>

<div class="num" id="p6">
<span class="num">6</span>
<p class="indent">The bond of 6th of March, 1785, and that of the 9th of October, 1787, were both fraudulently placed by Skillern in the hands of his agent, for the purpose of enforcing payment of both. The agent, supposing both bonds to be due, entered into an agreement with J. May's executors, the present defendants, for the discharge of the bond of 6th of March, 1785, and the same was given up by Skillern's agent to the defendants, with a receipt thereon. But the agent finding afterwards that the bond of 6th of March, 1785, was vacated by that of the 9th of October, 1787, refused to carry that agreement into effect, but brought an action of covenant upon the condition of the last mentioned bond, and recovered damages to the amount of 8,433 dollars and 33 cents.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p7">
<span class="num">7</span>
<p class="indent">John May devised his lands to his executors for the payment of his debts, and this bill was brought by Skillern, in his life-time, to subject the same to the payment of the judgment recovered at law. Pending this suit in chancery, Skillern died, leaving infant heirs, and the suit was revived in the name of his executors. Sixty acres, part of the 1,050 acres, had been sold for the payment of the <i>state</i> tax due from Skillern, and the two tracts of 300, and 250 acres, had been sold for the direct tax due to the United States, but were redeemed by the purchaser of the 60 acres.</p>

<p class="indent">After the filing of this bill, and after the death of Skillern, John May's executors filed a cross bill against Skillern's executors, and it was agreed that both suits should be tried at the same time.</p>

<p class="indent">The court below decreed a perpetual injunction as to 4,416 dollars 66 cents, part of the judgment at law, the same being the value of the 1,050 acres patented in the name of Skillern, and decreed payment of the residue out of the real estate of John May, unless it should be otherwise paid, by a day named in the decree.</p>

<p class="indent">1st. That inasmuch as both bonds, viz. that for 1,000 acres, and that for 1,100 acres, were given for one and the same consideration, a discharge of either was, in equity, a discharge of both; and that having discharged the first bond by a new engagement, the executors of Skillern could not, in equity, claim satisfaction of either.</p>

</div>
<div class="num" id="p16">
<span class="num">16</span>
<p class="indent">3dly. That as Skillern had suffered a part of the lands to be lost, by not paying the taxes, he had thereby made himself chargeable for the lands, and had in fact received a full equivalent for the consideration of the bonds; and therefore there ought to have been a decree for a perpetual injunction as to the whole amount of the judgment at law; especially as the fact of fraud on the part of Skillern is expressly found by the jury. The half of 2,500 acres was all he was entitled to, if his conduct had been fair. But as it has been found otherwise by a jury, a court of chancery ought not to have given its aid to enforce any part of the judgment at law.</p>

<span class="num">17</span>
<p class="indent">For <i>Skillern's executors</i> it was said, that it was not in the power of Skillern alone to put an end to the contract.

<p>ERROR to the circuit court for the district of Georgia, in a suit in equity, in which Pendleton and Webb were complainants, against Emanuel Wambersie, James Seagrove, and the representative of James Armstrong, Jacob Weed, and Henry Osborne, were defendants.</p>
<p>The bill stated that Henry Osborne, Jacob Weed, James Armstrong, James Seagrove, and the complainant John Webb, on the 22d of December, 1786, entered into an agreement with each other, under seal, to procure lands on their joint account in the state of Georgia, to an amount not exceeding 200,000 acres, at <span class="star-pagination">*74</span> their joint expense, and for their joint benefit. That grants were obtained for about 165,000 acres. That Webb by deed transferred all his right to the lands and contract to John M`Queen, in consideration of 400l. sterling, to be paid in four equal annual instalments. That M`Queen, not having paid Webb, assigned his right to Pendleton, the complainant, who undertook to indemnify M`Queen against Webb's demand. That Webb has never received the money due from M`Queen. That Wambersie, as agent for the company, had sold 60,000 acres of the land in Holland, at one dollar and fifty-six cents per acre, had received in cash 51,000 dollars, and had made himself liable for the balance. That he has refused to pay to the complainant, Pendleton, the one-fifth of the purchase money. That the other defendants refuse to divide the residue of the lands, and to account for the profits, &amp;c. That the lands are liable, in the hands of the purchasers, for the balance of the purchase money, both to the complainant Webb, for the purchase money due to him, and to the complainant Pendleton for his one-fifth of the amount of the sales. The bill seeks a discovery of the amount of lands granted to the company, of the amount sold, &amp;c. and prays that the defendants may account, and that the lands may be charged with the balance of the purchase money, &amp;c.</p>
<p>The defendants demurred for want of equity in the bill, and the court below sustained the demurrer, and decreed that the bill be dismissed, with costs.</p>
<p>But this court, without argument, overruled the demurrer, reversed the decree, and remanded the cause for further proceedings.</p>

<p class="parties">HUMPHREY MARSHALL AND WIFE,<br/>v.<br/>JAMES CURRIE.</p>
<p class="date">February Term, 1807</p>
<div class="prelims">
<p class="indent">ERROR to the district court of Kentucky, in a suit in chancery in which the plaintiffs in error were the original complainants. The bill complained that the defendant had obtained an elder patent for land covered by the comnlainants' elder entry, and prayed that the defendant might be compelled to convey to them the legal title.</p>
<p class="indent">The only question was whether the entry, under which the complainants claim, described the land with sufficient certainty. It was in these words, 'Number two hundred and forty one, Thomas Marshall enters two thousand acres of land on part of a military warrant, number one thousand three hundred and forty-nine, beginning on the bank of Green River, <i>two hundred poles above a beech tree marked</i> D. L. standing on the bank of the river, a few <i>poles</i> below the mouth of a branch, and <i>a small distance</i> above the place called <i>Glover's</i>, upon the opposite side of the river, thence running south seventy-five degrees east, one thousand poles, thence north, twenty-five degrees west, and from the beginning up the meanders of the river, and binding thereon so far, that a line parallel to the first shall include the quantity. Entered August the sixth, one thousand seven hundred and eighty-four.'</p>
<p class="indent">The material facts found by the jury, according to the practice of Kentucky, were, that the complainants' entry was made on the 6th of August, 1784, and the defendant's on the day following. That the defendant's patent bears date on the 14th of June, 1787, and the complainants' patent on the 3d of June, 1796, and that both patents include part of the same land. That the <i>Green River</i>, and the place called <i>Golver's</i>, were notorious by those names before, and at the time of the complainants' entry. That the water-course delineated on the plat, by the name of <i>Big Branch</i>, is a branch running into Green River, 596 poles above the place called <i>Glover's</i>, and on the opposite side of the river, and existed at the time of the entry. That the beech tree represented in the plat, stands on the bank of Green River, 18 poles below the mouth of the <i>Big Branch</i>, 'and is a very conspicuous tree; and that the letters D. L. were marked <i>at or near</i> said tree, <i>upon a beech</i>, about November or December, one thousand seven hundred and eighty three;' that the beginning corner of the complainants' survey is on the bank of Green River, 200 poles next above the said beech tree, marked on the plat. That two other water-courses empty into the Green River; one called Clover-lick-creek, below the <i>Big Branch</i>, and nearer to <i>Glover's;</i> the other called <i>Embro's Spring Branch</i>, above the <i>Big Branch;</i> both of which are laid down on the connected plat. The jury also found that there is a small <i>branch or drain</i> about 250 yards long, running all the year, between Clover-lick-creek, and the lower line of the plaintiff's survey, besides those represented on the plat. That beech abounds all along the bank of Green River, opposite to <i>Glover's</i> station, and for a considerable distance below and above, except immediately above and below the mouth of the small branch or drainâ€”and that there was no <i>proof</i> that there was any beech tree marked D. L. standing on the 6th of August, 1784, (the date of the complainants' entry) upon the bank of Green River a few poles below the mouth of a branch, as described in the complainants' entry.</p>
<p class="indent"><i>For the plaintiffs in error, H. Marshall</i> contended, that the entry was sufficiently definite in its description of the location, within the meaning of the act of Virginia.</p>
<p class="indent">The <i>Green River</i> and <i>Glover's</i>, were objects notorious, and respecting which there is no dispute. The <i>branch</i>, referred to in the entry, as being a <i>small distance</i> above <i>Glover's</i> is found, at the distance of 596 poles, which was a reasonable distance, according to the decisions in the cases of <i>Johnson</i> v. <i>Naulâ€”Craig</i> v. <i>M'Craken</i>, and <i>Moore</i> v. <i>Watkins</i>, in <i>Sneed's Reports</i>, pages 390. 393. 397. 404 <i>and</i> 405.</p>
<p class="indent">It is contended, that it does not appear that the letters D. L. were on the tree on the 6th of August, 1784. But the jury have found that those letters were marked on <i>a beech, at or near</i> the tree in question, in December, 1783, from whence a presumption arises that they remained on the tree until the 6th of August following, unless the contrary be shown. For although the jury have found that there was <i>no proof</i> of their being on the tree, on the 6th of August, yet they have not found that they were not, nor have they found any fact to rebut the presumption arising from the existence of the letters a few months before. The jury must have meant to say that there was no positive and conclusive proof, otherwise their last finding contradicts their first findingâ€”for the presumption arising from the actual existence of the letters, <i>is proof</i>, until that presumption be removed.</p>
<p class="indent">'<i>At, or near</i>' means <i>at</i>, unless the contrary is shown. <i>Sneed</i>, 120. <i>Crow</i> v. <i>Bannon</i>.</p>
<p class="indent">But if the letters were not on the tree, there is still sufficient certainty in the location. Green River and Glover's are admitted to be certain, but it is said the branch is uncertain, inasmuch as there are two other branches falling into Green River, not far from Glover's. But <i>Clove-lick-creek</i> is out of the question because the course of the river at that place, will not answer to the calls of the entry. <i>Embro's Spring Branch</i>, is further from Glover's than the <i>Big Branch</i> and the nearest branch which will satisfy the location ought to be taken. The <i>small branch or drain</i>, mentioned by the jury, is not located on the plat, and therefore we cannot say where it ought to be placed. But the jury have found that beech trees do not abound immediately above and below it, and therefore it is not probable that that was the branch referred to by the entry.</p>
<p class="indent">The courts in Kentucky have always endeavoured to sustain an entry, if by reasonable construction it be possible. For this purpose they will reject an absurd or superfluous callâ€”they will supply a wordâ€”they will consider a call not proved as expunged, and although there are more allegations than are proved, yet if enough is proved to render the entry sufficiently certain, the court will support it.</p>
<p class="indent">To support these positions, he cited the cases of <i>Consella</i> v. <i>Briscowâ€”Kenton</i> v. <i>M'Connel</i>, and <i>Pawling</i> v. <i>Merewether</i>, from <i>Hughes' Reports, p.</i> 15, 16. 45. 169. and <i>Gaither</i> v. <i>Tilford Morgan</i> v. <i>Robinsonâ€”Bradford</i> v. <i>Allenâ€”Craig</i> v. <i>Jonesâ€”Craig</i> v. <i>M'Craken</i>, and <i>Brown</i> v. <i>Johnson</i>, from <i>Sneed's Rep. p.</i> 184. 268. 101. 331. 54. 54. 52 and 60.</p>
<p class="indent"><i>H. Clay</i>, for the defendant in error, contended, that the beginning of the location was uncertain, and therefore that the whole entry was void. It does not appear that the letters D. L. ever were marked on the tree, nor that they existed on any tree at the time of the entry. The whole language of the entry is uncertain. 'A <i>few</i> poles,' 'a <i>small</i> distance,' 'a <i>branch</i>,' are expressions too vague to support an entry.</p>
<p class="indent">What is uncertain in point of <i>fact</i>, is not a subject of construction by the court. To support the complainants' entry, the court is now called upon, not to give a construction of law to the words of the entry, but to make a new entry in point of fact.</p>
<p class="indent">Identity, notoriety, natural objects are all wanting.</p>
<p class="center"><i>February</i> 28.</p>
<p class="indent">JOHNSON, J. delivered the opinion of the court.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p1">
<span class="num">1</span>
<p class="indent">In the argument of counsel in this case, the only point which it has been thought necessary to dwell upon, is the legal certainty of the complainants' entry. Pursuing the principle that a plaintiff must recover upon the strength of his own title, and not the weakness of his adversary's, the defendant has not entered into any discussion relative to the sufficiency of his claim to the land in question. The circumstances constituting what in the courts of Kentucky are denominated the calls of the complainants' entry, are, <i>Glover's Station, Green river, a marked tree on the bank of the river, and a branch emptying itself into the river</i>. The two former are notorious, and the inquiry is, can the others be sufficiently ascertained with relation to them. We are of opinion that they can. The only objection that can be made to the identity of the tree and branch with relation to which the complainants have made their survey, and the actual distance of those objects above Glover's Station, the uncertainty attendant upon calling for a tree of which a large number grow along the banks of the river, and the existence of another stream emptying itself into the same river nearer to Glover's Station, and which it is contended will answer the call.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p2">
<span class="num">2</span>
<p class="indent">These defficulties, we are of opinion, are all removed by considering the courses called for by the complainants with relation to the courses of the river.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p3">
<span class="num">3</span>
<p class="indent">Above Glover's Station, and until you reach the bend of the river above which the complainants' entry is surveyed, the course of the river is east and west. It there assumes a different direction, and its course is north and south. By surveying the entry at the point where the complainants have located their land, it assumes a shape adapted to the course of the river. At any point below where it is situated, and until you reach the place called Glover's Station, it is impossible that it can be located. This circumstance is sufficient in our opinion to establish the branch which was called for, as it is the first you meet with above the bend; and when that is ascertained, there is no longer any difficulty in locating the complainants' land.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p4">
<span class="num">4</span>
<p class="indent">The jury find that the tree called for is very conspicuous, and that previous to the date of the complainants' entry a tree very near the spot where that is situated was marked D. L. Although a tree of a particular species, at a distance not precisely limited, may be uncertain where that tree abounds, the impression of a certain mark upon such a tree is a sufficient identification, when accompanied with the other circumstances of this case, which might have been resorted to by a subsequent locator to prove the identity of this tree.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p5">
<span class="num">5</span>
<p class="indent">In giving this opinion the court is not uninfluenced by an anxiety to save the early estates acquired in that country. Such was the laxity of the rules upon which the rights of individuals depended under the land laws of Virginia, that this court feels a strong sense of the necessity of liberality in deciding upon the validity of entries.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p6">
<span class="num">6</span>
<p class="indent">The court, therefore, reverses the decree of the district court, and decrees a conveyance, to be executed by the defendant to the complainants, of that part of the land contained in his patent which is included in the complainants' survey, and that each party pay their own costs.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="star-pagination">*178</span> The answer of the defendants denied that the consideration of the deeds was as stated in the bill, and avers that the defendant Patsy, although solicited, always refused to make any promise of marriage to the deceased; that he often pressed her to accept his land, which she for some time declined; that he declared he did not expect any consideration, but wished her to receive it as a gift, and that he did not expect she would marry him.</p>
<p>It alleged that Brooks had boarded in her house some months, where he had been kindly and hospitably treated, without any charge being made against him, and suggested that this, together with the affection which he entertained for her, but which she always discountenanced, were his motives for giving her the land. That she at last, by the advice of her friends, accepted it, and that when he had executed the deeds he voluntarily declared himself to be fully satisfied, in the presence of the subscribing witnesses.</p>
<p>The facts found by the jury were, that the defendant Patsy, by her conduct to the deceased, induced him to suppose that she would marry him, and that this encouragement or inducement was the only consideration she gave for the land, except his boarding; but that she never made him any promise of marriage. That he had urged her to accept the land before she agreed to take it, and had declared to her that he did not expect to receive any consideration from her, but wished her to accept it as a gift; and that at the time he executed the deeds, he declared he did not expect that she would marry him. That she was advised by her friends to take the land before she agreed to accept it; and that, after the execution of the deeds, she offered to return to him the land, but he would not receive it. That Brooks boarded in her house, and never paid her any thing therefor, except the land. The jury also found the will of the deceased, and the devise to the complainant.</p>
<p>The decree of the court below, upon argument, was, that the defendants should convey the land to the complainant, and that the complainant should pay the defendants the amount of Brooks' board, and the taxes which had been paid by the defendants, with interest.</p>

<p>The appellants, Diggs and Keith, had commenced a suit at law against Alexander Wolcott, the appellee, in the county court for the county of Middlesex, in the state of Connecticut, upon two promissory notes given by Wolcott to one Richard Matthews, for the purchase of lands in Virginia, and by him indorsed to the appellants; whereupon Wolcott filed a bill in chancery in the superior court of the state, against the appellants Diggs and Keith, and also against Robert Young and Richard Matthews, praying that Diggs and Keith might be compelled to give up the two notes to be cancelled, or be perpetually enjoined from proceeding at law for the recovery thereof, &amp;c.</p>
<p>This suit in chancery was removed by the appellants from the state court into the circuit court of the United States for the district of Connecticut, where it was decreed that Diggs and Keith should, on or before a certain day, deliver the notes to the clerk of the court, and in default thereof should forfeit and pay to Wolcott 1,500 dollars; and that they should be perpetually enjoined, &amp;c. and that Robert Young should repay to the appellee the amount of principal and interest which the latter had paid on account of the purchase of the lands; and that the appellee should deliver up to the clerk the surveys of the lands, and the bond of conveyance; and in default thereof should pay to R.

<p>[*]  This case was brought up in expectation that this court would have decided the question whether an attachment can be served upon a person who resides out of the district, but within 100 miles of the place of trial, and who has been summoned and fails to attend as a witness in a civil cause.
</p>
<p>But the court, having intimated an opinion that the refusal to continue the cause could not be assigned for error, the counsel did not argue the other point.</p>

<center><p><b>Supreme Court of United States.</b></p></center>
<center></center>
<p>Upon the opening of the case, This Court, without argument, reversed the judgment.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*240</span> On a subsequent day, C. Simms, one of the counsel for the defendant in error, not having been present at the opening of the case, was permitted by the court to cite authorities in support of the opinion of the court below, and cited the following: Towers v. Barrett, 1 T.R. 133. where it was decided that assumpsit for money had and received will lie to recover money paid on a contract which is put an end to, as where, either by the terms of the contract it is left in the plaintiff's power to rescind it by any act, and he does it; or where the defendant assents to its being rescinded. In that case, the counsel for the defendant admitted, that when the party has done any thing to preclude himself from going into the contract, then money had and received will lie. Buller, J. said "the defendant left it in the power of the plaintiff to put an end to the contract. If the contract be open, the plaintiff's demand is not for the whole sum, but for damages arising out of that contract."</p>
<p>So in Giles v. Edwards, 7 T.R. 181. there was a special contract between the plaintiff and the defendant, which the defendant had prevented the plaintiff from completing. The court was clearly of opinion, that "as by the defendant's default the plaintiffs could not perform what they had undertaken to do, they had a right to put an end to the whole contract, and recover back the money they had paid under it." So here, Simms contended, that as the defendant had prevented the plaintiff from completing the contract, the plaintiff had a right to put an end to it. If he had paid money under the contract, he would have had a right to recover it back; but as instead of advancing money, he had done work and labour, which could not be recovered back in specie, he had a right to recover its value.</p>
<p>So in 1 Powell on Contracts, 417. "If he, who is benefited by another's fulfilling his contract or agreement, is the occasion why it is not carried into execution; the contract or agreement is thereby entirely dissolved, and the party bound discharged from his obligation."</p>
<p>But notwithstanding these authorities, The Court adhered to their first impression, some of the judges saying, <span class="star-pagination">*241</span> that the plaintiff had a clear right of action upon the sealed instrument; he might aver in his declaration that he had, in part, performed the work, and was ready to do the rest, but was prevented by the defendant. And whenever a man may have an action on a sealed instrument, he is bound to resort to it.</p>
<p>Judgment reversed.</p>

BIGELOW</h1></center>
<center><p><b>Supreme Court of United States.</b></p></center>
<center></center>
<p>MARSHALL, Ch. J. delivered the opinion of the court, as follows:</p>
<p>This case differs from that of Rose v. Himely in one material fact. The vessel and cargo, which constitute the subject of controversy, were seized within the territorial jurisdiction of the government of St. Domingo, and carried into a Spanish port. While lying in that port, proceedings were regularly instituted in the court for the island of Guadaloupe, the cargo was sold by a provisional order of that court, after which the vessel and cargo were condemned. The single question, therefore, which exists in this case is, did the court of the captor lose its jurisdiction over the captured vessel by its being carried into a Spanish port.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*294</span> The seizure was indisputably a valid seizure, and vested the lawful possession of the vessel in the sovereign of the captor. The right consequently existed in full force to apply immediately to the proper tribunals for an examination of, and decision on the offence alleged to have been committed. The jurisdiction of those tribunals had attached, and this right to decide upon the offence was complete.</p>
<p>When a seizure is thus made for the violation of a municipal law, the mode of proceeding must be exclusively regulated by the sovereign power of the country, and no foreign court is at liberty to question the correctness of what is done, unless the court passing the sentence loses its jurisdiction by some circumstance which the law of nations can notice. Recapture, escape, or a voluntary discharge of the captured vessel would be such a circumstance, because the sovereign would be thereby deprived of the possession of the thing, and of his power over it. While this possession remains, the res may be either restored or sold, the sentence of the court can be executed, and therefore this possession seems to be the essential fact on which the jurisdiction of the court depends.</p>
<p>The laws of the United States require that a vessel which has been seized for violating them should be tried in the district where the offence is committed, and certainly it would be irregular and illegal for the tribunal of a different district to act upon the case. But of this irregularity, it is believed, no foreign court could take notice. The United States might enable the admiralty courts of one district to decide on captures made for offences committed in another district. It is an internal regulation, to be expounded by our own courts, and of which the law of nations can take no notice. The possession of the thing would be in the sovereign power of the state, and it is competent to that power to give jurisdiction over it to any of its tribunals. There exists a full power over the subject, and an ability to execute the sentence of the court. The sovereign power possessing jurisdiction over the thing, must be presumed by foreign tribunals to have exercised that jurisdiction properly. But if the res be out of the power of the sovereign, he cannot act upon it, nor delegate authority to act upon it to his courts.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*295</span> If these principles be correct, it remains to inquire whether the brig Sea Flower remained in the possession and in the power of the sovereign of the captor after being carried into a Spanish port.</p>
<p>Had this been a prize of war, we have precedents and principles which would guide us. The cases cited from Robinson's Reports, and the regulations made by Louis XVI. in November, 1779, show that the practice of condemning prizes of war while lying in neutral ports has prevailed in England, and has been adopted in France. The objections to this practice may perhaps be sufficient to induce nations to change it by common consent, but until they change it the practice must be submitted to, and the sentence of condemnation passed under such circumstances will bind the property, unless the legislature of the country in which the captured vessel may be claimed, or the law of nations, shall otherwise direct.</p>
<p>The sovereign whose officer has in his name captured a vessel as prize of war, remains in possession of that vessel, and has full power over her, so long as she is in a situation in which that possession cannot be rightfully divested. The fact whether she is an enemy vessel or not ought however to be judicially inquired into and decided, and therefore the property in a neutral captured as an enemy is never changed until sentence of condemnation has passed; and the practice of nations requires that the vessel shall be in a place of safety before such sentence can be rendered. In the port of a neutral she is in a place of safety, and the possession of the captor cannot be lawfully divested, because the neutral sovereign, by himself or by his courts, can take no cognizance of the question of prize or no prize. This position is not intended to apply to the case of a sovereign bound by particular treaties to one of the belligerents; it is intended to apply only to those neutrals who are free to act according to the general law of nations. In such case the neutral sovereign cannot wrest from the possession of the captor a prize of war brought into his ports.</p>
<p>A vessel captured as prize of war is then, while lying in the port of a neutral, still in the possession of the sovereign <span class="star-pagination">*296</span> of the captor, and that possession cannot be rightfully divested.</p>
<p>It is objected that his courts can take no jurisdiction of a vessel under such circumstances, because they cannot enforce a sentence of restitution.</p>
<p>But it is to be recollected that the possession of the captor is in principle the possession of his sovereign; he is commissioned to seize in the name of the sovereign, and is as much an officer appointed for that purpose, as one who in the body of a county serves a civil process. He is under the controul and direction of the sovereign, and must be considered as ready to obey his commands legally communicated through his courts.</p>
<p>It is true that in point of fact cruisers are often commanded by men who do not feel a due respect for the laws, and who are not of sufficient responsibility to compensate the injuries their improper conduct may occasion; but in principle they must be considered as officers commissioned by their sovereign to make a seizure in the particular case, and to be ready to obey the legitimate mandate of the sovereign directing a restitution. The property therefore may be restored while lying in a neutral port, and whether it may or may not be sold in the neutral port, the condemnation without a sale may change the property, if such condemnation be valid.</p>
<p>In cases of prize of war, then, the difficulty of executing the sentence does not seem to afford any conclusive argument against the jurisdiction of the court of the captor over a vessel in possession of the captor, but lying in a neutral or friendly port.</p>
<p>Do the same principles apply to a seizure made within the territory of a state for the violation of its municipal laws?</p>
<p>In the solution of this question the court can derive no aid from precedent. The case perhaps has only occurred in the wars which have been carried on since the year 1793, and the court in deciding it finds itself reduced to the necessity of reasoning from analogy.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*297</span> The seizure, it has been already observed, vests the possession in the sovereign of the captor, and subjects the vessel to the jurisdiction of his courts. The vessel, when carried into a foreign port, is still in his possession, and he is as capable of restoring it if the offence should not have been committed, as he is of restoring a neutral vessel unjustly captured as an enemy. The sentence in the one case may be executed with as much facility as in the other.</p>
<p>Possession of the res by the sovereign has been considered as giving the jurisdiction to his court; the particular mode of introducing the subject into the court, or, in other words, of instituting the particular process which is preliminary to the sentence, is properly of municipal regulation, uncontrouled by the law of nations, and therefore is not examinable by a foreign tribunal. It would seem then that the principles which have been stated as applicable in this respect to a prize of war, may be applied to a vessel rightfully seized for violating the municipal laws of a nation, if the sovereign of the captor possesses the same right to maintain his possession against the claim of the original owner in the latter as in the former case. If, on a libel filed by the original owner in the courts of the country into which the vessel might be brought, the possession could be defended by alleging that she was seized for the violation of a municipal law, and the right of the court to decide the cause would be thereby defeated, then that possession would seem to be sufficiently firm to maintain the jurisdiction of the courts of the captor.</p>
<p>Upon this point much doubt has been entertained. It is, however, the opinion of a majority of the judges, that a possession thus lawfully acquired under the authority of a sovereign state could not be divested by the tribunals of that country into whose ports the captured vessel was brought; at least that it could not be divested unless there should be such obvious delay in proceeding to a condemnation as would justify the opinion that no such measure was intended, and thus convert the seizure into a trespass.</p>
<p>The judgment of the circuit court is to be reversed.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*298</span> CHASE and LIVINGSTON, Justices, dissented from the opinion of the court in these cases, because the vessel, which was seized for the violation of a French arrete or municipal regulation, was not brought into any port of France for trial, but was voluntarily carried by the captain of the privateer to St. Jago de Cuba, a Spanish port, and while lying there was, with her cargo, condemned as forfeited by a French tribunal sitting at Guadaloupe.</p>
<p>JOHNSON, J.</p>
<p>I concur in the reversal of the decision in the court below, but on different grounds from those which influence the opinion of my brethren. I had occasion in the case of The Sarah to express my ideas on most of the points arising in this case, and to that opinion I refer for the reasons of my present conclusion.</p>
<p>To me it appears immaterial whether the capture was made in exercise of municipal or belligerent rights, or whether within the jurisdictional limits of France, where she is supreme, or beyond those limits and upon the high seas, where her authority is concurrent with that of every other nation. We find the property in possession of the captor, underauthority derived from his sovereign, whose conduct cannot be submitted to our jurisdiction.</p>
<p>The modern practice of nations sanctions the condemnation of vessels lying in a foreign port, and that practice is not inconsistent with principle.</p>
<p>The plaintiff below has lost all remedy at law, and must look elsewhere for redress if he has sustained an injury.</p>
<p>Note. The cases of Palmer and Higgins v. Dutilh, and Hargous v. The Brig Ceres, being imperfectly stated, it not being ascertained whether the seizure was within or without the territorial jurisdiction of St. Domingo, were remanded for further proceedings.</p>

v.<br/>
HARRIS, BAILIFF OF CRAMMOND.</h1></center>
<center><p><b>Supreme Court of United States.</b></p></center>
<center></center>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*300</span> E.J. Lee, for the plaintiff in error.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*301</span> MARSHALL, Ch. J. delivered the opinion of the court as follows, viz.</p>
<p>In this case two errors are alleged by the plaintiff in error.</p>
<p>1st. That the circuit court misdirected the jury</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*302</span> 2d. That judgment for double damages ought not to have been rendered on the verdict.</p>
<p>1. The avowry, which sets forth the title under which the distress was made, states a lease for three years certain. The plea to this avowry was "nothing in arrear," and on this plea issue was joined. At the trial of the cause, the avowant gave in evidence a lease for one year certain, and a subsequent possession for two years. On motion to instruct the jury that this lease did not support the avowrv, the court said, that if the jury should be of opinion that the subsequent possession was under the original contract, and without any new agreement, then the avowant was entitled to recover, otherwise not. The jury found a verdict for the avowant.</p>
<p>The lease stated in the avowry is obviously a different lease from that which was given in evidence. A lease for three years is not a lease for one year. But it is contended that a subsequent possession, without any new express agreement, amounts to an extension of the original lease, and for this Bacon's Abridgment, and a dictum of Judge Buller, in the case of Birch v. Wright, 1 Term, 378. have been cited. But those cases do not prove the point they were supposed to establish. In those cases, the original terms of the lease admit of the extension which was afterwards made, by consent of parties. The lease was made for one year, and afterwards from year to year, as long as both parties should please. The principle of continuance is introduced into the original contract, and the occupation for three years is evidence that the circumstance had occurred, by force of which, the contract should be a lease for three years. But in this case the original contract contains no principle of continuance. It is for a limited time, and can only be extended by a new contract, either express or implied. The lease, therefore, offered in evidence, does not support the avowry. But a question on which the court has felt more difficulty, is this: Does the plea admit the demise, or is the avowant bound to prove it? If the plea admits the demise, then, notwithstanding the variance, the verdict is right, and <span class="star-pagination">*303</span> the court has not erred in that part of the opinion which is against the party taking the exception.</p>
<p>The issue gives notice to the parties of the point which is to be tried, and which the testimony must support. That which is admitted by the pleadings need not be proved. If the plea in this case controverts the allegation in the avowry, that the tenant held under a lease for three years, reserving the rent stated to be reserved, then the avowant would be bound to prove the demise as laid. But if the plea admits the demise, then the avowant is not bound to prove it. The plea is, that the sum distrained for of the rent aforesaid, (that is, of the rent claimed under the lease stated in the avowry,) was not in arrear and unpaid, nor was any part thereof in arrear and unpaid at the time when the distress was made, as the avowant in his avowry hath alleged.</p>
<p>This plea avers the single proposition that the rent was not in arrear when the distress was made, and it is this averment alone that the party making the distress is to meet. The averment that the rent claimed in the avowry was not in arrear when the distress was made, admits the contract by which the rent might accrue, and only denies that any thing, at the time of the distress, remained due upon that contract. Upon principle, then, it would seem that the plea had dispensed with proof of the demise laid in the avowry, by admitting</p>
<p>No case has been found in which the point has been expressly decided. It is said in Buller's Nisi Prius, p. 59. "If the plaintiff plead riens arrere in bar to an avowry, he cannot, upon such issue, give in evidence non-tenure;" consequently, the defendant cannot be required to show the tenure: for if it was necessary to show it, the tenant would be at liberty to produce opposing testimony.</p>
<p>It is also laid down in Buller, p. 166. that in covenant for non-payment of rent, riens in arrear, or payment, at the day, is a good plea; but riens in arrear generally <span class="star-pagination">*304</span> would not be a good plea: and the reason appears to be, that riens in arrear generally admits the breach laid in the declaration, and that the rent was not paid on the day. This principle is decided in King v. Saville, reported by Brownlow. Nothing in arrear on the day on which the rent is stated to have accrued seems to be considered as equivalent to payment on the day; but nothing in arrear on a subsequent day admits that the covenant was broken, and consequently admits the covenant. It is not a good plea, because it admits the right of the plaintiff to recover damages. This furnishes a strong argument in favour of the opinion that nothing in arrear on the day when the distress was made, admits that the rent accrued as stated in the avowry.</p>
<p>The case of Warner v. Theobald, Cowper, 588. was an action of debt for rent, by an assignee against an assignee. The plea of riens in arrear was demurred to, and consequently, the question to be decided by the court was not, what the plea admitted, but whether it was a bar to the action. Mr. Buller objected to this plea, because the plaintiff could not come prepared to know what it would be necessary to prove. The defendant might object to the assignment, or give in evidence payment before or after action brought.</p>
<p>In answer to Buller, Wood said, "The form of the plea is nil debet, in the present tense. But in this case riens in arrere is a fairer plea than nil debet; because nil debet puts the whole declaration in issue, whereas this confines the question to the single fact whether such rent was due."</p>
<p>In giving his opinion in support of the plea, Lord Mansfield certainly had not in view the question now under consideration; for he uses expressions which would apply differently to that question. He says, "saying nothing is due is the same as if he had said nil debet;" and immediately adds, "Besides, it is a more favourable plea for the plaintiff. He must then have applied the first assertion solely to the sufficiency of the plea as a bar, for it could not be a more favourable plea for the plaintiff, if it contested the whole declaration, <span class="star-pagination">*305</span> and admitted nothing, as is the case with nil debet." He concludes with observing, "If the rent was due, and is not at the time of the plea, it could not have ceased to be due but by the plaintiff's accepting it."</p>
<p>This case appears to the court to decide nothing further than that the plea pleaded was a good bar to the declaration in debt for rent, and to leave the question how far it admits the demise laid in the avowry, open for consideration.</p>
<p>It is thought important in the inquiry that the law appropriates a different plea, which controverts the demise, if the tenant means to contest it Â— the plea of non demisit.</p>
<p>The court is of opinion that the plea admits the demise; and that there is no error in the instruction given to the jury which is injurious to the party taking the exception.</p>
<p>In the judgment for double damages, there is no error. The law directs it positively.</p>
<p>Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>

<p>Winder, for the complainants.</p>
<p>ERROR to the circuit court for the district of Georgia, in a suit in equity.</p>
<p>The bill states that the complainants' testator and the defendant's testator, together with three others, viz. Boisfeillet, Du Bignon, and Grand Closmesle, became joint purchasers of the islands of Sapclo, Blackbeard, Jekyll, and half of St. Catharine, on the coast of Georgia; that Dumoussay was the acting partner, and kept all the accounts, &amp;c. That an account was stated and signed by the two testators, Chappedelaine and Dumoussay, on the 30th of April, 1792, by which the former acknowledged a balance of 667l. 10s. 1 3-4d. due to the latter; but that the account was erroneous in sundry items particularly set forth in the bill; that there were sundry debits which had accrued since that settlement, and that Chappedelaine had been obliged by a suit in equity to refund to Boisfeillet a large sum which Dumoussay had overcharged him. That Dechenaux was the executor of the estate of Chappedelaine as well as of Dumoussay, and as executor of Chappedelaine had defended the suit of Boisfeillet. The bill contains a prayer that the defendant may account touching all monies due on rectifying the errors; and for all other sums due by Dumoussay in his life-time, not credited nor accounted for, or which have come to the hands of the defendant, and that he pay over such balance as shall appear on settlement of all accounts, and for general relief. The defendant pleaded the settled account in bar of so much of the bill as sought to open the account, and by answer denied all fraud and error.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*307</span> Upon hearing, the court below ordered a reference to auditors, with directions "to make a general statement of accounts between the parties, rejecting any erroneous charges which may appear in their settlement, and adding such as may have been omitted."</p>
<p>The auditors, on the 23d of April, 1805, instead of stating an account, reported that they found "a balance due from the defendant to the complainants, including interest upon the liquidated account up to this date, fifteen thousand five hundred and eighty-six dollars and twenty-two cents." They stated that they had not taken into consideration a claim of the complainants of 1,000l. which the estate of Chappedelaine was condemned to pay to Boisfeillet by decree of the court, nor their claim for indemnity for damages said to have been sustained by sale of lands, conceiving those claims not submitted to them, but reserved for the decision of the court.</p>
<p>Exceptions being taken to this report, the court ordered the auditors to "make a statement showing the items of the general account, which they rejected, in whole or in part, and the reasons of their rejections, and also such items as were added as omissions, and their reasons for so doing."</p>
<p>In obedience to this order, the auditors made an explanatory report, whereupon the court decreed that 604l. 6s. and 579l. 8s. 1d. be deducted from the liquidated account of the 30th of April, 1792; that interest be allowed on the balance at eight per cent from that date, and that the defendant pay out of the assets that balance and interest, and the further sum of 3,823 dollars, being the amount stated by the auditors as having accrued since the 30th of April, 1792, and costs.</p>
<p>The errors assigned in the record were,</p>
<p>1. That the bill was insufficient in law.</p>
<p>2. That the court had not jurisdiction, because, although the bill states the complainants to be French citizens, and the defendant a citizen of Georgia, yet the two testators were citizens of Georgia.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*308</span> 3. That I. Trubert, who is stated in the answer to be residuary legatee of Dumoussay, was not made a party; and because the other legatees were not made parties.</p>
<p>4. That the stated account has been partially opened, and abatements made to the injury of the legatee.</p>
<p>5. That the exceptions to the report of the auditors ought to have been sustained.</p>

<p class="indent">It is admitted that the defendant had the right at the time of payment to direct its application, and that if he did not then exercise that right, it devolved upon the plaintiff. But the question is, <i>when</i> is the plaintiff to exercise the right? Can he, at any indefinite period after the payment, and under any change of circumstances, apply the payment as he pleases? Can he, at the moment of trial, when the defendant produces evidence of payments, say I choose to apply these payments to the other account? The rules of law are all founded in reason. Some reasonable limit must be supposed to the exercise of this right. In the present case the interests of third persons are involved. The sureties may have been lulled into security by the evidence of these payments.</p>

<p class="indent">The law is conclusively settled in Virginia, by the highest tribunal in that state, in the case of <i>Braxton</i> v. <i>Southerland</i>, 1 <i>Wash.</i> 133. where the president of the court of appeals, in delivering the opinion of the court, says, 'Although, if the debtor neglect to make the application at the time of payment, the election is then cast upon the creditor, yet it is incumbent upon the latter, in such a case, to make a <i>recent</i> application, by entries in books or papers, and not to keep parties and securities in suspense, changing their situation from time to time, as his interest, governed by events, might dictate.' And upon this principle the decree of the court in that case was founded. It was not a mere <i>dictum</i>, but the very ground of the court's decision. This then being the law of Virginia, the court below was bound by it.</p>

<p class="indent">If the opinion of the court of appeals of Virginia needed support, it would be found in 2 <i>Pothier on Obligations</i>, 45. who gives it as a rule of the civil law, that 'when the debtor in paying makes no application, the creditor to whom money is due for different causes may apply it to the discharge of which he pleases.' But he goes on to say, 'It is necessary, 1st. That this application should have been made <i>at the time;</i> and, 2d. That the application which the creditor makes should be equitable.' Another rule, in <i>p.</i> 49. is, that 'when the application has not been made either by the debtor or the creditor, the application ought to be made to that debt which the debtor had, at the time, most interest to discharge.' And, as a <i>corollary</i>, he says, 'The application is made rather to the debt for which the debtor has given a <i>surety</i>, than to those which he owes alone. The reason is, that in paying the former he discharges himself towards <i>two</i> creditorsâ€”his principal creditor, and his surety whom he is bound to indemnify.'These principles are confirmed by 1 <i>Domat.</i> 287. <i>tit. de solutione</i>.</p>

It does not decide the question now before the court, which is, whether the plaintiff is not bound to make a recent application in cases where the interests of sureties are concerned.</p>

</div>
<div class="num" id="p16">
<span class="num">16</span>
<p class="indent">It is a clear principle of law, that a person owing money on two several accounts, as upon bond and simple contract, may elect to apply his payments to which account he pleases; but if he fails to make the application, the election passes from him to the creditor. No principle is recollected which obliges the creditor to make this election immediately. After having made it he is bound by it, but until he makes it he is free to credit either the bond or simple contract.</p>

<span class="num">17</span>
<p class="indent">Unquestionably, circumstances may occur, and perhaps did occur in this case, which would be equivalent to the declaration of his election on the part of the debtor, and therefore the court was correct in instructing the jury, that if they should be satisfied that the payments were understood to be made on account of the goods sold at vendue, they ought to apply them to the discharge of that account; but in declaring that the election, which they supposed to devolve on the plaintiff if the application of the money was not understood at the time by the parties, was lost if not immediately exercised, that court erred.</p>

And it is further enacted, that the justices shall return the confession of judgment to the clerk of the court, where the first judgment was rendered, by the next court in course, to be entered on record; and after the expiration of the time limited in such confession, it shall be lawful to take out execution thereon, without a <i>scire facias</i> or any other delay, against either the principal or the security, or all or either of them for such judgment so confessed.</p>

Suppose there should be five solvent defendants, and one insolvent who supersedes the judgment with two sureties; the plaintiff cannot take out execution against the five, until the expiration of the six months.

He has signed his name as <i>mayor</i>, yet he may also be a justice of peace of the county. They might as well assert that John Ott is not a justice of peace, because he has not signed his name as such. There is no such office as that of a justice of peace of Georgetown.

<p class="parties">BLAINE<br/>v.<br/>THE SHIP CHARLES CARTER.<br/>DONALD AND BURTON AND OTHERS CLAIMANTS.</p>
<p class="date">February Term, 1808</p>
<div class="prelims">
<p class="indent">ERROR to the circuit court for the district of Virginia.</p>
<p class="indent">Blaine libelled the ship <i>Charles Carter, Bell</i> master, owned by M'Cawley, upon two bottomry bonds; one executed in London by <i>Bell</i> the master, on the 14th of July, 1796, and payable ten days after the arrival of the ship in Virginia; the other executed on the 27th of October, 1796, by M'Cawley the owner, in Virginia where he resided, and payable in thirty days after the arrival of the ship in Europe. The answer of <i>M'Cawley</i> admitted the truth of all the allegations of the libel; but a claim was interposed by <i>Donald and Burton</i>, creditors of <i>M'Cawley</i>, who had on the 30th of November, 1797, obtained judgment against him, and at whose suit the marshal on the 30th of December, in the same year, had seized the ship in execution upon several writs of <i>fieri facias</i>, issued on the 7th of the same month, from the circuit court for the district of Virginia, before the warrant of arrest had issued from the district court, upon Blaine's libel. The libel was filed on the 19th of January, 1798, on which day also the warrant to arrest the ship was issued.</p>
<p class="indent">It appeared in evidence, that the first bottomry bond was given by the master to Blaine, upon the first voyage to London, and that the consideration of that bond consisted of money paid to take up a prior bottomry bond and given to one Robertson, and of money paid for seamen's wages, provisions, repairs, and <i>finishing</i> the ship, she having come out from Virginia in a rough unfinished condition, and badly provided with sails and rigging. The money upon this bond was to be paid within ten days after the arrival of the ship in Virginia. She arrived in Virginia on the 28th of September, in the same year; after which the agent of Blaine called for the discharge of the bond, but on failing to receive the money, did not think it necessary to arrest the vessel. Blaine was a very large creditor of M'Cawley, over and above the amount of the bottomry bonds, and was authorised to receive the freights of the ship, and to apply them to his general account current with M'Cawley. The bond of the 27th of October, 1796, was taken in order to secure advances made by Blaine to M'Cawley to enable him to finish the ship before she sailed on her first voyage in March, 1796, to the time of her sailing, or at any time afterwards, and to secure Blaine for money paid by him to discharge three executions which had been served upon the ship. Between the date of the first bottomry bond, and the filing of the libel, the ship made two voyages from England to America, and one from America to England, and the freights were received by Blaine. The <i>district court</i> decreed in favour of Blaine for the whole amount of the first bottomry bond, and for so much of the other as appeared to have been actually advanced for necessaries for the ship; but the <i>circuit court</i>, on the 6th of December, 1799, reversed the decree, and dismissed the libel with costs. Blaine appealed from the decree of the circuit court, to this court, but the appeal was at that time dismissed for want of a <i>statement of facts</i> made in the court below, agreeably to the 19th section of the judiciary act of 1789, c. 20. After the passing of the act of congress of 3<i>d of March</i>, 1803. <i>vol.</i> 6. <i>p.</i> 315. <i>c.</i> 93. the cause was brought up again by writ of error, and was now argued upon the evidence contained in the record.</p>
<p class="indent"><i>C. Lee</i>, for the plaintiff in error.</p>
<p class="indent">The hypothecation in London was a legal lien upon she ship, and no circumstance had occurred to deprive the libellant of its benefit. Possession of the vessel hypothecated, is never delivered to the obligee of a bottomry bond; so that no inference of fraud can be drawn from the fact, that the possession remained with the obligor: nor was there any rule of law which required the obligee to assert his lien in any given time. This lien was prior to that of the judgment creditors.</p>
<p class="indent">As to the bond of 27th of October, 1796, given by the owner in Virginia, it rests upon the same law as the bond of the master. An <i>owner</i> may borrow money, on bottomry, for fitting out his ship for a voyage, and hypothecate the ship therefor. <i>Cro. Jac.</i> 209. <i>Sharpley</i> v. <i>Hurrel</i>, 2 <i>Bl. Com.</i> 458. A master, if part owner, may take up money on bottomry to the value of his own share, in places where the owners reside. 2 <i>Molloy, b.</i> 2. <i>c.</i> 2. <i>s.</i> 14, <i>and</i> 15. Hence it may be inferred that any other owner may do the like. If the master may hypothecate the ship <i>a fortiori</i> may the owner. <i>Park</i>, 410. The executions of Donald and Burton were void, because issued within ten days after the judgments, contrary to the act of congress. <i>Vol.</i> 1. <i>p.</i> 63. <i>s.</i> 23.</p>
<p class="indent"><i>P. B. Key</i>, for the defendants in error, contended,</p>
<p class="indent">1. That the bonds were paid off by the receipt of the freights which ought to have been applied to that purpose.</p>
<p class="indent">2. That there was no bottomry consideration for the second bond; and</p>
<p class="indent">3. That the bonds were fraudulently held up by Blaine, to give a false credit to M'Cawley, while Blaine was receiving the whole benefit of the vessel.</p>
<p class="indent">1st. With regard to the freights, he contended that, as there was no application at the time of the receipt of them, a court ought to apply them to the discharge of the bottomry bonds.</p>
<p class="indent">2d. That as Blaine was the correspondent of M'Cawley, and his creditor to a large amount, and the consideration of the bonds being charged <i>in account, M'Cawley</i> was at all events personally liable for the monies advanced, and therefore these monies did not run the risk of the voyage. That the bottomry bond of 27th October, 1796, was given for monies long before advanced, and to be advanced, and not for necessaries advanced upon the credit of this security on the ship.</p>
<p class="indent">3d. That his suffering the vessel to go several other voyages after the bonds became due, was either evidence of fraud, or of a waiver of the lien on the vessel. It was absurd to suppose that he would risk the money a second and a third time on the vessel, without a new premium, or an insurance. It is probable that the second bond was intended to cover the vessel during her winter's stay in Virginia.</p>
<p class="indent">If the executions were improperly issued, the remedy was to move to quash them on their return. Perhaps they were voidable, but they were not void.</p>
<p class="center"><i>March</i> 8.</p>
<p class="indent">CHASE, J.<a class="footnote" href="#fn-s" id="fn-s_ref">*</a> delivered the opinion of the court.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p1">
<span class="num">1</span>
<p class="indent">The libel in this case was filed upon two instruments of writing purporting to be bottomry bonds, the one executed by the master in a foreign port, the other by the owner in a port of the state of Virginia, in which state the libel was filed.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p2">
<span class="num">2</span>
<p class="indent">The voyage in the former bond terminated in Virginia, and the vessel has since made two voyages. The latter instrument was on a voyage which terminated in London, and the vessel has since made a voyage to this country. Upon her return here, and before the warrant of the admiralty was served, the executions were levied upon her, which form the ground work of the claim interposed by Donald and Burton.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p3">
<span class="num">3</span>
<p class="indent">The ship has been sold under the order of the court below, and the question is, who has the preferable claim to the money now lying in the marshal's hands. On the validity of the bond of the master there can be no question. It is acknowledged by counsel to possess all the requisites of a good bottomry bond. But it was contended that it was satisfied by the freights, which it appears Blaine was in the receipt of; and if not satisfied, was fraudulently upheld to the prejudice of general creditors. In addition to the objections taken to the first bond, it is further contended against the second, that it wanted a sufficient bottomry consideration in part or in the whole. The court think it unnecessary to give a particular consideration to the several objections above stated. A satisfactory conclusion on the rights of the parties may be drawn from other principles, on the nature and effect of the contract of bottomry.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p4">
<span class="num">4</span>
<p class="indent">A bottomry bond made by the master vests no absolute indefeasible interest in the ship on which it is founded, but gives a claim upon her which may be enforced with all the expedition and efficiency of the admiralty process. This rule is expressly laid down in the books, and will be found consistent with the principle of the civil law, upon which the contract of bottomry is held to give a claim upon the ship. In the case of a bottomry bond executed by an owner in his own place of residence, the same reason does not exist for giving an implied admiralty claim upon the bottom, for it is in his power to execute an express transfer or mortgage. There is strong reason to contend that this claim or privilege shall be preferred to every other for the voyage on which the bottomry is founded, except seamen's wages. But it certainly can extend no further. Had the warrant of the admiralty been first served upon the ship, there might be some ground to contend that this court ought not to divest that possession in favour of executions served at a subsequent day, at least to the prejudice of the bond executed by the master. But as the executions in this case were levied before the service of the warrant, and so long after the bonds became due, the owners of the ship had lost that possession, upon which alone the warrant of the admiralty could operate, after losing the right of preference.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p5">
<span class="num">5</span>
<p class="indent">Some objections have been made to the validity of these executions, on the ground of their having issued previous to the day on which by law they ought to have issued. On this point the court will give no opinion. If irregular, the court from which they issued ought to have been moved to set them aside; they were not void, because the marshal could have justified under them, and if voidable, the proper means of destroying their efficacy have not been pursued.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p6">

<p class="indent">The decree of the circuit court is affirmed, and the money ordered to be paid over to the execution creditors.</p>

<p>This case comes on upon a special demurrer to a replication filed by the plaintiffs to a plea of payment after the day. The replication is double, and consequently ill. But it is a known rule that a demurrer brings all the pleadings before the court; in consequence of which, judgment must be rendered against him who has committed the first fault; or, which will most generally produce the same result, for him who upon the whole record shall appear to be entitled to their judgment. It therefore becomes necessary to examine the plea of the defendants. By their agreement with the secretary of the treasury, they were bound to pay to the bankers of the United States in Amsterdam the sum of 500,000 guilders in the following manner, viz. 230,000 guilders on or before the first day of February, 170,000 guilders on or before the first day of March, and the remaining 100,000 guilders on or before the first day of June, in the year 1803. The first payment was made on the day, and the last before the day, but the second payment was made on the thirteenth day of May, instead of the first day of March. On the effect of this payment, the whole case depends.</p>
<p>The defendants plead that they did, on the 13th day of May, at Amsterdam, pay to the bankers of the United States, for the use of the United States, the sum of 170,000 guilders. The replication admits this payment as pleaded, but denies that it was accepted, received and allowed by the United States in payment and satisfaction of the same sum which was payable on the first of March. The replication proceeds to aver that the said sum of 170,000 guilders was not paid on the first day of March, nor had the defendants paid the damages of 20 per cent which were stipulated, in case of failure to pay on the day.</p>
<p>The fact upon these pleadings appears to be, that the payment was received by the United States without any <span class="star-pagination">*342</span> stipulation respecting the effect of that receipt, upon their agreement with the defendants. If payment to the bankers of the United States, the persons to whom by agreement the money was to be paid, was not payment to the United States, it would not be a payment to the use of the United States, which the plea avers, and the replication in terms admits. In such case the replication, instead of averring that this sum was not accepted in satisfaction of the same sum payable at an earlier day, would have averred, and ought to have averred, that it was not accepted at all, and was not a payment to the use of the United States, in which case, instead of a special replication, issue might have been tendered on the plea. The court, then, understands the fact as stated in the pleadings to be, that the money was received without any agreement whatever, and the law must determine the effect of such a payment.</p>
<p>The payment made to the bankers in Amsterdam being then an actual payment to the United States, the inquiry is, whether it was such a payment, and is so pleaded, as to bar this action.</p>
<p>It is admitted that the statute of Anne, which allows payment after the day to be pleaded, is in force in Pennsylvania, but it is contended that this bond is not within that statute; or, if it is, that this plea is not good under it.</p>
<p>If this be a bond within the statute of Anne, on which the court gives no opinion, yet by that statute, the payment must be of the whole sum actually due, or the action for the penalty is not barred.</p>
<p>In this case the sum due on the first of March was paid on the 13th of May, without interest or damages.</p>
<p>By the United States it is contended, that damages at the rate of 20 per centum on the sum of 170,000 guilders were then due; by the defendants it is contended that no interest was due.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*343</span> The words of the contract to which each party refers, are not precisely the same in the condition of the bond and in the articles of agreement which are referred to by the bond. There is no contradiction between them; but there is a variance in this, that the condition of the bond expresses more fully than the articles the idea of the parties, that in case of failure to perform the contract at Amsterdam, the demand for payment was to be made in Philadelphia. The words of the condition are, "or in case the said sums shall not be paid as aforesaid, then to repay to the United States the value of the said 500,000 guilders, at the rate of exchange current in Philadelphia at the time demand of payment is made, together with damages at the rate of 20 per cent, in the same manner as if bills of exchange had been drawn for the said sum, and they had been returned protested for non-payment, and lawful interest for any delay of payment that may take place after the demand."</p>
<p>The defendants were merchants residing and carrying on trade in Philadelphia, in which place the contract was made, and by the law of the state, bills of exchange returned unpaid under protest are liable to 20 per cent damages. It is sufficiently obvious, from these circumstances, and from the words of the condition, that the parties contemplated a repayment in Philadelphia in the event of non-payment in Amsterdam.</p>
<p>It is contended by the plaintiffs that, the instant the failure to pay the 170,000 guilders on the first of March had taken place, a full and complete right to the stipulated damages was vested in the United States, without any further act on their part; and that a payment of the principal sum on the succeeding day would not have relieved the defendants from those damages.</p>
<p>In this opinion the court does not concur with the counsel for the United States.</p>
<p>Contracts are always to be construed with a view to the real intention of the parties. In this contract, the object of the United States was to remit to their bankers in Amsterdam a sum of money, for which they had <span class="star-pagination">*344</span> occasion in Europe. The heavy damages to be incurred by the defendants in the event of their failing to make the stipulated payments in Amsterdam, were considered as a compensation for the disappointments produced by the non-payment of the money at that place in such time as to answer the purposes of the contract. Whether payment at the same place on a subsequent day would answer these purposes, was for the United States to determine. They might accept it, or they might reject it, and claim whatever the law of their contract would give them. In the event of non-payment in Amsterdam at the time stipulated, the defendants are to repay to the United States the value of the guilders they shall have failed to pay in Amsterdam, "at the rate of exchange current in Philadelphia at the time demand of payment is made, together with damages at the rate of 20 per cent." The fair interpretation of this agreement is, that the demand is to be made in Philadelphia, that the money is to be repaid in Philadelphia, and that the damages are upon the money there to be repaid. Had apart of the sum of 170,000 guilders been paid on the first of March, it will scarcely be contended that damages would have accrued on that part. A repayment of it could not have been demandable in Philadelphia It appears to the court that the acceptance of any part of the sum due in Amsterdam on a subsequent day, is a waiver of the claim to damages in Philadelphia on the sum so accepted, for that sum cannot be demanded in Philadelphia.</p>
<p>This reasoning, to which the majority of the court would strongly incline, from the nature and circumstances of the contract, derives much additional force from the reference to bills of exchange. The repayment of the value of the guilders "at the rate of exchange current in Philadelphia at the time demand of payment is made, together with damages at the rate of 20 per cent," is to be made "in the same manner as if bills of exchange had been drawn for the said sum, and they had been returned protested for non-payment."</p>
<p>Why is this reference made to bills of exchange?</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*345</span> The stipulation that damages at the rate of 20 per centum should be incurred on those sums which the defendants might fail to pay at the time and place mentioned in their contract, did not require it, unless the law of bills of exchange was either to explain or to give validity to that stipulation. To a majority of the court it is satisfactory evidence that the parties intended this contract, if not as a complete substitute for bills of exchange, to operate between themselves as if bills had been drawn. The law of Pennsylvania regulating bills of exchange was well understood. If those drawn on any part of Europe are returned back unpaid with a legal protest, the drawers and indorsers are subjected to damages at the rate of 20 per centum. But the right to these damages is not complete until the bill be returned back under protest. Till then they are not demandable. Consequently, payment before the bill returns does away the right to demand them. By receiving payment, the holder waives his right to damages. The express reference to bills which is made in this contract, and the terms in which that reference is made, being considered by the majority of the court as explanatory of the intention of the parties that the right to damages should be put on the same footing as if bills had been drawn, form an additional reason for their opinion that an acceptance in Amsterdam after the day, before a demand in Philadelphia, amounts to a waiver of any right the United States might otherwise, perhaps, have had to demand the stipulated damages.</p>
<p>But whether the sum agreed to be paid as a compensation for a failure to pay at the time and place mentioned in the contract, be considered merely as a penalty, or as stipulated damages, of which the law will coerce the payment, a forfeiture took place on the non-performance of the condition of the bond, and a right to something more than that condition vested immediately in the obligees. If the reservation of damages in the condition of the bond is in law only a double penalty, then interest is the legal compensation for this breach of the covenant contained in the condition of the bond. If it be even of the character given to it by both parties in argument, the amount of damages settled by the parties themselves, the majority of the court <span class="star-pagination">*346</span> is not satisfied, that in waiving those damages the obligee has, without any agreement on the subject, relinquished that right to interest which is attached to all contracts for the payment of money, which is only displaced by the agreement to receive a larger sum in damages, and which a mere tacit implied waiver of those stipulated damages might reinstate. The majority of the court, therefore, is of opinion, that under the circumstances which have taken place, the United States ought to receive, under this contract, interest on the sum of 170,000 guilders, from the first of March, the day on which that sum ought to have been paid, until the thirteenth of May, the day on which it was actually paid. Judgment, therefore, on the pleadings, must be rendered for the plaintiffs.</p>
<p>By the 26th section of the judicial act, it is directed, that in cases of this description the court shall render "judgment for so much as is due according to equity. And when the sum for which judgment should be rendered is uncertain, the same shall, if either of the parties request it, be assessed by a jury."</p>
<p>In this case it is the opinion of the majority of the court, that judgment ought to be rendered for so much as remains due of the sum of 170,000 guilders, calculating interest thereon from the first of March in the year 1803, and if either of the parties request it, that a jury be impanelled to ascertain the value of this sum in the money of the United States.</p>

THE CARGO OF THE SHIP FAVOURITE.</h1></center>
<center><p><b>Supreme Court of United States.</b></p></center>
<center></center>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*349</span> Reed, United States attorney for the district of Delaware, contended.</p>
<p>Broom and Van Dyke, contra.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*358</span> MARSHALL, Ch. J. delivered the opinion of the court, as follows:</p>
<p>In these cases two questions are to be decided by the court.</p>
<p>1st. Is the cargo of the Favourite, or any part of it, forfeited to the United States?</p>
<p>2d. Are Ware and others entitled to any, and if to any, to what salvage?</p>
<p>The first count in the first libel filed on the part of the United States claims the brandies, wines and cordials therein mentioned, in consequence of their being found in the possession of certain persons therein named, unaccompanied <span class="star-pagination">*359</span> with such marks and certificates as are required by law, the duties thereon not having been paid, or secured to be paid.</p>
<p>The second count claims them as forfeited because they were removed, without the consent of the collector, before the quantity and quality of the said wines and spirits, and the duties thereon, were ascertained according to law; the duties thereon not having been paid or secured.</p>
<p>The third count claims them because they were found concealed, the duties not having been paid or secured according to law.</p>
<p>The second libel claims certain other goods, which were parcel of the cargo of the Favourite, as forfeited, by being found unlawfully concealed, the duties thereon not having been paid or secured.</p>
<p>The facts of the case are these: The ship Favourite, belonging to Mr. Peisch, of Philadelphia, was discovered about the last of October adrift in the bay of Delaware, with her masts gone by the board, and without anchors, cables or rudder, and in danger of being carried out to sea. A company was formed to save the vessel and cargo; and with considerable labour, in the course of several days, the cargo was unladen and landed at Lewis, a small town on the bay, not a port of delivery, where it was, with the approbation of the collector, left under the care and in the custody of a revenue officer residing at that place, who was one of the party that had originally taken possession of the vessel, and under whose direction the whole business had been in a great measure conducted. On the 3d of November, while the salvors were unlading the vessel and landing the cargo, an imperfect entry was made by the owners or consignees, after which an award was made between the owners and salvors, by which the salvors were allowed one half the cargo. The owners were dissatisfied with this award, and refused to acquiesce under it. The collector ordered the goods, which had been in the custody of a revenue officer, to be carried to Wilmington for the purpose of <span class="star-pagination">*360</span> ascertaining the amount of duties. The salvors objected to this, and requested that the duties might be ascertained at Lewis, offering at the same time to pay the duties on the moiety of the cargo claimed by them under the award. The collector persisting in his determination to remove the goods to Wilmington, the salvors sued out a writ of replevin from the state court, and by force of that writ took the goods out of the possession of the revenue officer. This act is the foundation of the forfeiture alleged in the libels.</p>
<p>The forfeiture said to be occasioned by the goods being found without the marks and certificates required by law, depends upon the 43d section of the act for collecting duties, and on other sections of the same act, which are explanatory of the 43d section. The particular clause giving the forfeiture is in these words: "And if any casks, chests, vessels or cases, containing distilled spirits, wines, or teas, which by the foregoing provisions ought to be marked and accompanied with certificates, shall be found in possession of any person, unaccompanied with such marks and certificates, it shall be presumptive evidence that the same are liable to forfeiture." The law then authorises a seizure, and subjects such distilled spirits, &amp;c. to forfeiture, unless it be proved at the trial that they were imported according to law, and that the duties were paid or secured.</p>
<p>The objects of this clause are those vessels only which "by the foregoing provisions" ought to be marked and accompanied with certificates. To determine its extent, the "foregoing provisions" must be looked into.</p>
<p>This subject is first taken up in the 37th section of the act. That section directs particular and additional entries to be made of distilled spirits, wines and teas, which provisions are adapted to regular importation, not to those articles when saved from a wreck.</p>
<p>The entry is to be made by the importer or consignee, and specifications are required which can only be given by the owner or consignee, when in possession of the papers relative to the vessel and cargo. If a vessel be <span class="star-pagination">*361</span> wrecked on the coast, the cargo must be lost, or brought on shore without the knowledge of the owner or consignee, so as to put it in his power to make the entry, and the salvors are not only not the persons designated by the law to make, but they will often not possess the information which would enable them to make it.</p>
<p>The act proceeds to require that this entry shall be transmitted to the surveyor of the port where the delivery of the cargo is to commence, to whom also every permit for unlading or landing any part of the cargo must be previously produced, who shall record the same, and indorse thereon the word "inspected," the time when, and his own name. Goods landed previous to these formalities are to be forfeited.</p>
<p>These regulations obviously respect a regular importation, where all these pre-requisites to landing may be performed; not cases where a landing must take place without them. To suppose them applicable to salvage goods, would be to suppose that the legislature designed to prohibit salvage entirely, or to forfeit the cargoes of all vessels which might be wrecked on the coast.</p>
<p>The 38th section requires that all distilled spirits, wines and teas, shall be landed under the inspection of the surveyor, or other officer acting as inspector of the revenue for the port, and therefore can relate only to cases of regular importation at the port of delivery, where the revenue officer may superintend the landing. He is directed to attend at all reasonable times, not at all places.</p>
<p>The 39th section prescribes the duty of the officer of inspection of the port where the spirits, &amp;c. may be landed. He is to ascertain the duties and mark the casks.</p>
<p>The 40th section directs the surveyor, or chief officer of inspection of the port or district in which the said spirits, wines or teas shall be landed, to give the proprietor, importer or consignee a general certificate; and the 41st section directs him to give a particular certificate <span class="star-pagination">*362</span> for each vessel, which certificate passes with the vessel to the purchaser.</p>
<p>These sections are connected with those which precede them, and relate to regular importations, where the spirits, &amp;c. are landed under a permit at a port of delivery, and there is a proprietor, importer or consignee, or an agent to whom the certificates may be granted; not to spirits, &amp;c. which may, from the nature of things, lawfully get into the possession of individuals without the knowledge of a revenue officer.</p>
<p>The 42d section only directs that blank certificates shall be provided.</p>
<p>These are the sections which precede that which is supposed to give the forfeiture claimed under this count of the libel.</p>
<p>The first part of the 43d section directs the proprietor, importer or consignee, who may receive the said certificates, to deliver them with the vessels to the purchaser; and then comes the clause which subjects to forfeiture all vessels containing spirits, &amp;c. which may be found unmarked and not accompanied by certificates, which by the foregoing provisions ought to be marked and accompanied by certificates.</p>
<p>In the foregoing provisions the legislature, in the opinion of this court, did not intend to comprehend wrecked goods, or goods found under circumstances like those in the Favourite, where the vessel was deserted by her crew, and where it might be necessary, for the preservation of the goods, to take them to the nearest accessible part of the coast. Either these spirits and wines would have been liable to forfeiture if brought to land under the most pressing circumstances, where inevitable loss must attend any delay, if a revenue officer should not be present to take possession of them, or the single circumstance of their being found unmarked and unaccompanied with certificates, is not in itself sufficient to forfeit them. The opinion of the court that it was not the intention of the legislature to subject goods, under such circumstances, to forfeiture, is not formed exclusively <span class="star-pagination">*363</span> on the extreme severity of such a regulation. It is formed also on what is deemed a fair construction of the language of the several sections of the law, which seems not adapted to cases like the present.</p>
<p>The second count in the libel claims the goods as forfeited, because they were, without the consent of the proper officer, removed from the place where they were deposited, before the amount of duties was ascertained, the duties at that time not being paid or secured.</p>
<p>Neither this count, nor the first, supposes any forfeiture to have been incurred by the landing of the goods, or the unlading of the vessel. The spirits and wines are presumed to have been legally brought on shore, and it is the removal only which gives title to the United States. The court therefore is to inquire, whether these goods were under such circumstances that a removal, such as has taken place in this case, will produce a forfeiture. This depends on the 51st section of the law, in expounding which, it becomes proper to notice the 50th also. This section prohibits the unlading of any vessel, or the landing of any goods, without a permit granted by the proper officers, and subjects the master or other person having the command of such vessel, and all those who shall be concerned in unlading, removing, or storing such goods, to heavy penalties, and the goods themselves to forfeiture.</p>
<p>It was well observed that the application of this section to cases where the goods must perish, if not immediately brought on shore, and to cases in which a permit cannot regularly be granted, would be not only to prohibit, but to punish every attempt to save a cargo about to be lost on the coast. This construction of the law could only be made where the words would admit of no other. But it is unquestionably a correct legal principle, that a forfeiture can only be applied to those cases in which the means that are prescribed for the prevention of a forfeiture may be employed. The means prescribed to save the forfeiture given in the 50th section cannot be employed where a vessel is deserted by her crew, or cannot be brought into port. The permit cannot be obtained, nor can those steps which must precede the attainment <span class="star-pagination">*364</span> of a permit be taken. Upon just legal construction, then, the landing of these goods without a permit did not subject them to the forfeiture of the 50th section. This act is not within the law. The 50th section is calculated for cases in which the general requisites of the law can be complied with, not for salvage goods, in cases where those general requisites cannot be complied with.</p>
<p>The 51st section relates to the removal of goods from the wharf or place on which they may have been landed in conformity with the directions of the 50th section. It presupposes a permit, and that they were landed under the inspection of a revenue officer, in the manner prescribed by the 38th section.</p>
<p>It presupposes a case in which the guaging and marking may be done, and the other means prescribed for the ascertainment of the duties and security of the revenue may be taken, at the place of landing; not a case in which a landing must be made without a permit, often in the absence of a revenue officer, and where the goods could not be permitted, without extreme peril, to remain at the place of landing until these measures should be taken.</p>
<p>The court is also of opinion, that the removal for which the act punishes the owner with a forfeiture of the goods must be made with his consent or connivance, or with that of some person employed or trusted by him. If, by private theft, or open robbery, without any fault on his part, his property should be invaded, while in the custody of the officer of the revenue, the law cannot be understood to punish him with the forfeiture of that property. In the 52d section, therefore, to which the revenue officers seem to have intended to conform, so far as the case would admit, which directs them in the case of an incomplete entry to store the goods at the risk and expense of the owner or consignee, no forfeiture is annexed to their removal, unless the penalties of the 51st section, or of the 43d section, be applied to the 52d.</p>
<p>The court is of opinion that those penalties cannot be so applied in this case, not only because, from the whole <span class="star-pagination">*365</span> tenor of the law, its provisions appear not to be adapted to goods saved from a vessel under the circumstances in which the Favourite was found, but because, also, the law is not understood to forfeit the property of owners or consignees, on account of the misconduct of mere strangers, over whom such owners or consignees could have no controul.</p>
<p>It has been urged, on the part of the United States, that although the property of the owner should not be forfeited, yet that moiety which is claimed by the salvors has justly incurred the penalties of the law. But if the award rendered in this case be not binding, the salvors could have only a general claim for salvage, such as a court might allow; and if it be binding, still they acquired no title to any specific property. Their claim was in the nature of a general lien, and any irregular proceeding on their part would rather furnish motives for diminishing their salvage, if that be not absolutely fixed by the award, than ground of forfeiture. The irregularity, too, if any, which has been committed by them, being merely an attempt to assert, in a course of law, a title they supposed themselves to possess, and with no view to defraud the revenue, this court would not be inclined to put a strained construction on the act of congress, in order to create a forfeiture.</p>
<p>The third count in the first libel, and the second libel, claim a forfeiture on the allegation that the goods were concealed. The fact does not support this allegation. There was no concealment in the case.</p>
<p>Taking all the circumstances into consideration, it is the unanimous opinion of the court, that no forfeiture has been incurred, and that the libels filed on the part of the United States were properly dismissed.</p>
<p>The next question to be considered is, to what amount of salvage are the salvors entitled? That their claim is good for something, is the opinion of all the judges; but on the amount to be allowed, the same unanimity does not prevail.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*366</span> For the quantum of salvage to be allowed, no positive rules are fixed. It depends on the merit of the salvors, in estimating which, a variety of considerations have their influence.</p>
<p>In the case before the court, the opinion of the majority is, that the sentence of the circuit court ought to be affirmed. This opinion, however, is made up on different grounds. Two of the judges are of opinion that the award was fairly entered into, and although both parties might be mistaken with respect to the obligation created by the law of Delaware, yet there is no reason to suppose any imposition on either part; nor is there any other ground on which the award can be impeached or set aside. Two other judges, who do not think the award obligatory, view it as the opinion of fair and intelligent men, on the spot, of the real merit of the salvors, and connecting it with the testimony in the cause, are in favor of the salvage which has been awarded, and which has been allowed by the sentences of the district and circuit courts. Three judges are of opinion that the award is of no validity, and ought to have no influence. They think the conduct of the salvors, in taking the goods out of the possession of the revenue officer, though by legal process, is improper, and that the salvage allowed is too great.</p>
<p>They acquiesce, however, cheerfully, in the opinion of the majority of the court, and express their dissent from that opinion, solely for the purpose of preventing this sentence from having more than its due influence on future cases of salvage.</p>
<p>The sentence of the circuit court is affirmed, without costs.</p>

The right of property is proved to be in the plaintiff as heir of the patentee; and possession by operation of law, accompanies the title, unless the contrary is shewn; and <i>until</i> it is shewn.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p11">
<span class="num">11</span>
<p class="indent">If possession is taken by a wrong-doer, and severed from the title (of which there is no evidence in this case) then such naked possession, so acquired, may be defeated, either by <i>entry of the owner</i>, which is an act in <i>pais</i>, revesting the possession, and again uniting it with the right; or <i>by ejectment</i>, which is an act of law, to recover the possession with damages, &amp;c.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p12">
<span class="num">12</span>
<p class="indent">If a wrong-doer, after taking possession, dies in possession, and a descent is cast, this, under some circumstances, changes the title to a <i>right of entry</i>, or rather makes an <i>actual entry</i> necessary to give effect to the title. There are many cases in which actual entry is necessary to reunite the title with the possession, and for these cases the law of Georgia was made. But it cannot apply to a case where the title and the possession have not been separated.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">That law requires two things:</p>
<div class="num" id="p13">
<span class="num">13</span>
<p class="indent">1st. When the right is changed to a mere <i>right of entry</i>, or <i>where an entry is indispensable to complete the title</i>, then such entry must be within seven years from the accruing of such right of entry. But this does not apply to the case on the record. No disseisin, discontinuance, descent, or adverse possession existed, to make an actual entry necessary on the part of the plaintiff. The title and the possession were both in him.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p14">
<span class="num">14</span>
<p class="indent">2d. The statute gives remedy by ejectment within seven years <i>after the cause of action accrued</i>. In this case no cause of action accrued till the 10th of September, 1804, when the plaintiff's possession was disturbed. So long as it remained undisturbed he could not bring suit.</p>

<div class="prelims">
<p class="indent">ERROR to the circuit court for the district of Columbia, sitting at Alexandria.</p>
<p class="indent"><i>C. Simms</i>, for the defendant in error, having obtained a rule on the <i>plaintiff in error</i>, to show cause why the writ of error should not be quashed,</p>
<p class="indent"><i>Roungs, E. J. Lee</i>, and <i>Jones</i>, now showed cause; and read a printed paper produced by the other side, purporting to be the act of assembly of Virginia, of 1792, incorporating the bank, and giving them a right to obtain judgments against their debtors at the first term, without appeal or writ of error; another printed paper, also produced by the other side, purporting to be the act of assembly of Virginia, of the 21st of January, 1801, continuing the act of 1792, until the year 1811, which would otherwise have expired in the year 1803; the act of congress of the 27th of February, 1801, erecting the circuit court for the district of Columbia, and providing for an appeal or writ of error to this court, in all cases where the matter in dispute shall exceed the value of one hundred dollars, with a proviso that nothing in that act should impair the rights granted by, or derived from the acts of incorporation of any body corporate within the district; the act of assembly of Virginia, of 1789, ceding to the United States a territory for the seat of their government, and the act of congress of 1790, accepting the cession.</p>
<p class="indent">They contended,</p>
<p class="indent">1. That when the legislature of Virginia passed the act of 21<i>st of January</i>, 1801, continuing the act of 1792, which incorporated the bank, the state of Virginia had no power to legislate for the district of Columbia, and therefore could not give continuance to the act of 1792, as a law in that district. The consequence of which is, that there is now no law in the district of Columbia which gives to the bank any exclusive privileges.</p>
<p class="indent">2. That the act of Virginia, of 21st of January, 1801, was not adopted as the law for the district of Columbia, by the act of congress of 27th of February, 1801.</p>
<p class="indent">3. That if the act of 21st of January, 1801, was adopted as to its general provisions, yet so much of it as takes away the right of appeal was not adopted, because inconsistent with that part of the adopting law, which gives an appeal or writ of error, in all cases where the matter in dispute exceeds the value of 100 dollars.</p>
<p class="indent">4. That the acts of 1792, and 21st of January, 1801, were private acts, and that the papers read, purporting to be those acts, were not sufficiently authenticated, and could not be noticed by the court.</p>
<p class="indent">The points being opened, the court requested to hear the counsel on the other side.</p>
<p class="indent"><i>C. Simms</i>, for the bank.</p>
<p class="indent">The first question is, whether the right of Virginia to legislate for the district of Columbia, ceased on the 1st Monday in December, 1800, when the district became the seat of the national government, or on the 27th of February, 1801, when congress first provided by law for the government of the district under their jurisdiction. By the act of assembly of Virginia, passed on the 3d of December, 1789, for the cession of a territory, for the permanent seat of the general government, (<i>Revised Code, p. 52.</i>) it is enacted, 'that a tract of country, not exceeding ten miles square, or any lesser quantity, to be located within the limits of this state, and in any part thereof as congress may by law direct, shall be, and the same is hereby, forever ceded and relinquished to the congress and government of the United States, <i>in full and absolute right and exclusive jurisdiction</i>, as well of soil as of persons residing or to reside thereon, pursuant to the tenor and effect of the 8th section of the 1st article of the constitution of government of the United States.''Provided, that the jurisdiction of the <i>laws</i> of this commonwealth, over the persons and property of <i>individuals</i> residing within the limits of the cession aforesaid, shall not cease or determine, <i>until congress</i>, having accepted the said cession, <i>shall by law provide for the government thereof, under their jurisdiction</i>, in manner provided by the article of the constitution before recited.'</p>
<p class="indent">By the act of congress of 16<i>th of July</i>, 1790, <i>for establishing the temporary and permanent seat of the government of the United States, vol.</i> 1. <i>p.</i> 132. it is enacted 'that a district of territory, not exceeding ten miles square to be located, as hereafter directed on the river Potomac, at some place between the mouths of the <i>Eastern-branch</i>, and <i>Connogochegue</i>, be, and the same is hereby accepted for the permanent seat of the government of the United States; <i>provided nevertheless</i>, that the <i>operation of the laws</i> of the state, within such district, shall not be affected by this acceptance, until the time <i>fixed</i> for the removal of the government thereto, and until congress shall otherwise by law provide.</p>
<p class="indent">The time for the removal of the government to the district, was by the same act <i>fixed</i> to be the first Monday in December, 1800.</p>
<p class="indent">The government having been on that day removed to the district, congress did not by law provide for the government thereof, under their jurisdiction, until the 27th of February, 1801; until which day, we contend, the jurisdiction of the laws of Virginia, or in other words the right of Virginia to legislate for the district, did not cease or determine. Virginia had therefore a right to pass the act of 21st of January, 1801, which was consequently one of the existing laws of Virginia, in the district of Columbia, on the 27th of February, 1801, when congress enacted, 'that the laws of Virginia as they <i>now</i> exist, shall be and continue in force in that part of the district of Columbia, which was ceded by the said state to the United States, and by them accepted for the permanent seat of the government.'There are only two instances in which congress have referred to the 1<i>st Monday of December</i>, 1800, as the period of separation, viz. in the act of 3<i>d March</i>, 1801, <i>s.</i> 7. <i>vol.</i> 5. <i>p.</i> 290. authorising the sheriffs of the adjoining counties in Maryland and Virginia, to proceed to collect taxes and officers' fees, due before that day; and in the act of <i>May</i> 3<i>d</i>, 1802, <i>s.</i> 13. <i>vol.</i> 6. <i>p.</i> 183. which refers to the militia-laws of the states of Maryland and Virginia, as they stood in force in the district, on the 1st Monday of December, 1800.</p>
<p class="indent">The right of the bank to obtain judgment against their debtors at the first term without appeal, is a right granted to them by their act of incorporation, and is therefore saved by the proviso of the statute of 27th February, 1801, and is therefore an exception to the general clause, which gives a right of appeal in all cases.</p>
<p class="indent">But it is contended that the acts of Virginia, incorporating the bank of Alexandria, are private acts, and that the printed papers now produced ought not to be regarded by the court as evidence of the existence of such acts. The acts which we read to the court, are found printed with, and bound up among the public acts of the commonwealth. The title-page declares the book to contain the acts of assembly of the commonwealth of Virginia, and to be printed by Augustine Davis, who, we are ready to prove, was the public printer for the years when those laws were passed. By the act of assembly of Virginia, of 22d January, 1798, the public printer is to be appointed annually, by the joint ballot of both houses, and it is made his duty to publish <i>all</i> laws passed during the session. (<i>New Revised Code</i>, 382.) The executive is also bound by law, to send copies of all the laws, when printed, to the clerks of the courts, &amp;c. and by another statute, private acts of assembly may be given in evidence, without pleading them specially. (<i>New Rev. Code</i>, 59. 112.)</p>
<p class="indent">There is a difference between the laws of Virginia, and those of England, respecting the authentication of private acts. In England they are never printed nor promulgated, but remain with the clerk of parliament. But in Virginia they are printed and promulgated by the authority of the legislature, and are as well authenticated as public acts.</p>
<p class="indent">But this is a public act.</p>
<p class="indent">CHASE, J. The act makes it felony to counterfeit the notes of this bank. Does not that make it a public act?</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p1">
<span class="num">1</span>
<p class="indent">MARSHALL, Ch. J. said, that the opinion of the court was very strong, that this is a <i>publie</i> act; and that if it were not, it being printed by the public printer, by order of the legislature, agreeably to a general act of assembly for that purpose, it must be considered as sufficiently authenticated. But that the court would not prevent counsel from arguing the point, if they thought they could support the contrary opinion; which the counsel declined attempting.</p>
</div>

<div class="num" id="p4">
<span class="num">4</span>
<p class="indent">MARSHALL, Ch. J. said, the court is so much of opinion that the point is decided by the case of <i>Wilson and Mason</i>, (<i>ante, vol.</i> 1. <i>p.</i> 91.) that they are inclined to hear the other side.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p5">
<span class="num">5</span>
<p class="indent">By the Virginia land law, no appeal or writ of error is allowed in <i>caveats;</i> and by the compact between Virginia and Kentucky, that law was immutable; yet this court, in <i>Wilson and Mason</i>, decided that the act of congress which gives a writ of error in all cases, so far repealed the state law, as to prevent it from operating upon the United States court, for the district of Kentucky.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p6">
<span class="num">6</span>
<p class="indent">JOHNSON, J. Perhaps a distinction may be drawn between that case and this. If the bank of Alexandria had a vested right under the act of incorporation, it is saved by the proviso in the act of 27th of February, 1801.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p7">

<p class="indent">By the 8th section of the 1st article of the constitution of the United States, power is given to congress, 'To exercise <i>exclusive legislation</i> over such district, not exceeding ten miles square, as may by cession of particular states, and the acceptance of congress, become the seat of the government of the United States.' The moment the district became the seat of government, congress had the right of exclusive legislation over it. There could be no concurrent rights of exclusive legislation. The idea is absurd and impossible. There can be but one right of exclusive legislation, and by the constitution of the United States, it was vested in congress. It is not necessary that congress should have exercised the right in order to vest it in themselves. It must have vested in them before they could exercise it. The district of Columbia, both in law and in fact, became the seat of government of the United States, on the 1st Monday of December, 1800. From that moment the right of the state of Virginia to legislate over the district ceased. It could make no law to affect the property, or persons within it. Virginia did not attempt it. She knew she had no power, and therefore she has used language appropriate only to her own territory. She has authorised the stockholders to choose their directors in the state of Virginia, out of the district. She speaks of the town of Alexandria, as being 'in that part of the district of Columbia, which <i>heretofore</i> formed a part of this commonwealth.'</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p10">
<span class="num">10</span>
<p class="indent">Three things only were necessary to vest the exclusive power of legislation in congress. A cession of territory by some of the statesâ€”an acceptance by congressâ€”and the ceded territory being actually the seat of the government of the United States. These events had all happened on the first Monday of December, 1800. No further act was necessary. The right to legislate was complete and exclusive whether congress exercised it or not.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p11">
<span class="num">11</span>
<p class="indent">But it is said that, if Virginia could not legislate for the district of Columbia, yet she could legislate for herself; and congress by the act of 27th February, 1801, adopted <i>all</i> her laws as they <i>then existed</i>.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p12">
<span class="num">12</span>
<p class="indent">As they existed <i>where?</i> we say, as they then existed <i>in the district of Columbia;</i> that was the territory over which congress was legislating, and their object was merely to <i>continue</i> in force the laws, then existing in the district.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p13">
<span class="num">13</span>
<p class="indent">If Virginia had no right to legislate for the district of Columbia, when she passed the act of the 21st of January, 1801, that act was not in force, and did not exist, as a law, in the district of Columbia, on the 27th of February, 1801; and if it did not then exist as a law in the district, it could not be <i>continued</i> in force by the act of congress. The words of the act of congress are, 'the laws of the state of Virginia as they now exist, shall be and <i>continue</i> in force, in that part of the district,' &amp;c.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p14">
<span class="num">14</span>
<p class="indent">The legislatures of Virginia, and of the United States, both began their sessions on the same first Monday of December, 1800. It is not possible that congress, when they had passed the act of the 27th of February, 1801, should know what acts Virginia had passed at that session. The laws of that session were not then promulgated; and it cannot be supposed that congress meant blindfold to adopt whatever Virginia should chuse to enact. It cannot be presumed that congress would have adopted the act of 21st of January, 1801, if they had known it, because it was equivalent to giving the bank of Alexandria a new charter; and to give any bank a charter by a law of the United States, prior to the 4th of March, 1811, is to violate the public faith, pledged to the bank of the United States. If therefore a doubt can be raised as to the intention of the United States, this court will not give the law such a construction as would violate the public faith.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p15">
<span class="num">15</span>
<p class="indent">There is another objection to that part of the act of Virginia, which gives exclusive privileges to the bank of Alexandria.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p16">
<span class="num">16</span>
<p class="indent">It is directly repugnant to the bill of rights of Virginia, the fourth article of which declares, 'that no man, <i>or set of men</i>, are entitled to exclusive or separate emoluments, or <i>privileges</i> from the community, but in consideration of public services.'</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p17">
<span class="num">17</span>
<p class="indent">MARSHALL, Ch. J. We will consider that point when we come to the general merits of the case.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p18">
<span class="num">18</span>
<p class="indent"><i>Youngs</i>. But if the court should quash the writ of error, they will never hear the merits.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p19">
<span class="num">19</span>
<p class="indent">CHASE, J. But if it <i>be</i> contrary to the constitution of Virginia, are <i>we</i> to decide upon its unconstitutionality? I must say I think we cannot.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>E. J. Lee</i>, on the same side.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p21">
<span class="num">21</span>
<p class="indent">We do not contend that the bank has no charter; we admit that the bank still exists as a corporate body in Virginia, and may there exercise all its functions, choose its officers, keep its banking house, and transact its business. But we say it has no peculiar privileges in the courts of the United States. We deny it has existence as a corporate body in the district of Columbia, and that the court below is bound by any of the remedies which the bank is entitled to in the courts of Virginia, by virtue of any law of Virginia, passed since the first Monday in December, 1800. It never had a right to its summary remedy in the courts of the United States, and therefore no such right could be saved by the proviso in the act of the 27th of February, 1801. We consider the case of <i>Wilson and Mason</i> as decisive.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p22">

<p class="indent"><i>Swann</i>, contra.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p23">
<span class="num">23</span>
<p class="indent">There is a distinction to be taken between this case and that of <i>Wilson and Mason</i>. There the right of appeal was a <i>constitutional</i> right. It grew out of the constitution of the United States, which gave to the courts of the United States jurisdiction between citizens of different states, and to this court its appellate power. This is the ground taken by the court in delivering its opinion in that case.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p24">
<span class="num">24</span>
<p class="indent">But the right of appeal in this district is not a constitutional right. The courts of this district are of legislative, not of constitutional creation. The power of this court to hear appeals from the circuit court of this district, is a power <i>not</i> derived from the constitution. This district is like a state, and congress legislates for it as a state legislature would for a state.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p25">
<span class="num">25</span>
<p class="indent">The act of the 21st of January, 1801, was an existing law operating upon this part of the district on the 27th of February, 1801. On the 21st of January, 1801, the jurisdiction of Virginia <i>in all respects whatever</i> existed over this district, and continued until congress by an act <i>assumed</i> the jurisdiction. Congress had <i>power</i> to exercise exclusive legislation, but was not <i>bound</i> to exercise it. Until they chose to exercise it by providing for the government of the district, the jurisdiction of the laws of Virginia was not to cease. What is the jurisdiction of the laws, but the jurisdiction of the commonwealth? The jurisdiction of the laws comprehends the whole jurisdiction. If not the <i>whole</i> jurisdiction, what <i>part</i> does it comprehend? It was intended that there should be no <i>interregnum</i>, no time in which the inhabitants of the district should be without laws, and without the means of enforcing them. The jurisdiction of the courts and officers was to continue, as well as the laws, to be considered as mere rules of conduct.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p26">
<span class="num">26</span>
<p class="indent">It is evident by the act of February 27, 1801, that congress considered the district as remaining under the jurisdiction of Virginia until that day.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p27">
<span class="num">27</span>
<p class="indent">The legislature of Virginia had the same understanding. The act of the 21st of January, 1801, says, the charter of the bank is <i>hereby</i> continued, which they could not do, unless they had jurisdiction. The court of Hustings of Alexandria was also holden in January and February, 1801, by the justices holding their offices under Virginia.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p28">
<span class="num">28</span>
<p class="indent">Here then was the concurrent understanding of the congress, of the legislature of Virginia, and of the courts of that part of the district.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p29">
<span class="num">29</span>
<p class="indent">But even if the power of Virginia to legislate for the district had ceased, the act of 21st of January, was a law in Virginia on the 27th of February, 1801, and as such was adopted by the act of congress of that date.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p30">
<span class="num">30</span>
<p class="indent">It is said that congress cannot be supposed to intend to adopt the laws of the session of Virginia, which began on the 1st Monday of December, 1801, because congress cannot be presumed to have had knowledge of them. But congress cannot be presumed to have had knowledge of all the laws which were in existence, in Maryland and Virginia, before that period. Yet they adopted them. They took them upon trust; and they had as much reason to adopt those of the session of 1800-1801, as those of any former period.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p31">

<p class="indent"><i>C. Simms</i>, on the same side.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p32">
<span class="num">32</span>
<p class="indent">It is admitted that the jurisdiction of Virginia did not cease by the act of cession of 1789, nor by the act of acceptance of 1790; why should it cease on the first Monday of December, 1800? We say four things were necessary to divest the jurisdiction of Virginia.â€”1. The cession. 2. The acceptance. 3. The removal of the seat of government to the district, and 4. The actual providing by congress for the government of the district under their jurisdiction. Only three of these four events had happened on the first Monday of December, 1800.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p33">
<span class="num">33</span>
<p class="indent">What reason is there for supposing that Virginia retained an executive and a judicial jurisdiction over the district, and not a legislative jurisdiction also? If she could legislate for the district, after the cession and acceptance, she retained that power until congress provided for the government of the district.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p34">
<span class="num">34</span>
<p class="indent">By the act of cession in 1789, individual rights were not to be impaired by the change of jurisdiction whenever it should take place. This provision applied not to rights then existing, but to any which might be acquired under the laws of Virginia, before the actual transfer of the jurisdiction; so that there was a pledge of the public faith, in favour of the bank of Alexandria, prior to that in favour of the bank of the United States. Before the transfer of jurisdiction, also, the bank of Alexandria had acquired a right to the summary remedy without appeal.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p35">
<span class="num">35</span>
<p class="indent">The plaintiff in error had no right to complain of the exercise of that summary remedy in his case. He knew the rights of the bank before he obtained their credit, and became their debtor.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p36">
<span class="num">36</span>
<p class="indent">The decision of this court in <i>Wilson and Mason</i>, was predicated upon the principle that no act of a state legislature could deprive the courts of the United States of their jurisdiction; but here the act taking away the right of appeal, has been adopted by congress, and therefore is in fact a law of the United States.</p>

</div>
<div class="num" id="p39">

<p class="indent">The distinction attempted to be drawn between this case, and that of <i>Wilson and Mason</i>, is not founded in fact.

<p class="indent">The cases which occur in the district of Columbia, under the exclusive legislation of congress, are all cases which arise under the constitution and laws of the United States.

<p class="indent">The circuit court of the district of Columbia is a branch of the judiciary of the United States. It holds by the same tenure as every other court of the United States, and exercises a part of the judicial power of the United States, and this court exercises its appellate jurisdiction as much under the constitution in these cases, as in any other.</p>

<p class="indent">The same general question therefore occurs in this case as in that of <i>Wilson and Mason;</i> and is to be decided by the same principles.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p44">
<span class="num">44</span>
<p class="indent">If it was intended to say that the general jurisdiction of Virginia should continue until congress should legislate for the district, the legislature of Virginia, and congress would have said so expressly, and not used the limited expressions, '<i>jurisdiction of the laws</i>,' and '<i>operation of the laws</i>.' The power of legislation may cease, and yet the jurisdiction of the laws remain, and the officers of justice still continue to exercise their functions by virtue of the compact. Such is the case in conquered and ceded countries. They generally, by treaty, remain under the jurisdiction of the old laws, and old officers, until new laws are enacted, and new officers appointed; and yet it is not contended that the old sovereign can legislate for them.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p45">
<span class="num">45</span>
<p class="indent">The act of congress accepting the territory, either explains or restricts the act of cession. It uses the expression, '<i>operation</i> of the laws' instead of '<i>jurisdiction</i> of the laws.'</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p46">
<span class="num">46</span>
<p class="indent">We contend they mean the same thing, i. e. that the laws shall remain as the rule of conduct, until altered or repealed by congress. Virginia and the United States were two sovereigns treating respecting a cession of territory. They agree that the cession shall take effect upon a certain event, and that the laws then existing in the ceded territory, shall continue until the new government shall otherwise provide.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p47">
<span class="num">47</span>
<p class="indent">This cession took effect on the 1st Monday of December, 1800, and by the terms of the cession and acceptance, the laws then in force in the district were to continue in operation until congress should provide for the government thereof. The laws then which were in force in the district, on the 27th of February, 1801, were those only which were in force on the first Monday of December, 1800. By the act of 27th of February, congress declares that the laws of Virginia <i>as</i> they <i>now exist</i>, shall <i>be and continue</i> in force, &amp;c. The expression is not, <i>which</i> now exist, but <i>as</i> they now exist, which is descriptive of the manner in which they existed; that is by virtue of the cession and acceptance.</p>

<p class="indent">MARSHALL, Ch. J. delivered the opinion of the court as follows, viz.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p49">
<span class="num">49</span>
<p class="indent">This is a motion to quash a writ of error which has issued to a judgment obtained by the bank of Alexandria in the circuit court for the district of Columbia sitting in Alexandria. In support of the motion, it is contended that no writ of error lies to such a judgment.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p50">
<span class="num">50</span>
<p class="indent">The words of the act of congress of February, 1801, by which the circuit court for the district of Columbia was erected, are these: 'Any final judgment, order or decree, in the said circuit court, wherein the matter in dispute, exclusive of costs, shall exceed the value of one hundred dollars, may be re-examined, and reversed or affirmed, in the supreme court of the United States, by writ of error or appeal.'</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p51">
<span class="num">51</span>
<p class="indent">Upon the operation of this clause in the 'act concerning the district of Columbia,' no doubt could be entertained, were it not produced by the last section, which enacts that nothing in that act contained 'shall in any wise alter, impeach or impair the rights granted by or derived from the acts of incorporation of Alexandria and Georgetown, or of any other body corporate or politic within the district.'</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p52">
<span class="num">52</span>
<p class="indent">The state of Virginia had, in November, 1792, passed an act for establishing a bank in the town of Alexandria, which act incorporated the bank, and, in addition to the privilege of summary process for the recovery of debts, deprived their debtors of the right of appeal.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p53">
<span class="num">53</span>
<p class="indent">In January, 1801, the legislature of Virginia passed an act continuing the charter of the bank to the 4th of March in the year 1801, and authorising them to transact business in the county of Fairfax.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p54">
<span class="num">54</span>
<p class="indent">It is the opinion of the majority of the court, under the terms of the cession and acceptance of the district, that the power of legislation remained in Virginia until it was exercised by congress.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p55">
<span class="num">55</span>
<p class="indent">But the question recurs, whether that part of the act of Virginia which takes away the right of appeal, taken in connection with the act of congress passed in February, 1801, is now in operation.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p56">
<span class="num">56</span>
<p class="indent">The words of the act of congress being as explicit as language can furnish, must comprehend every case not completely excepted from them. The saving clause in the last section only saves existing rights; it does not extend those rights, or give new ones. The act incorporating the bank professes to regulate, and could regulate, only those courts which were established under the authority of Virginia. It could not affect the judicial proceedings of a court of the United States, or of any other state.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p57">
<span class="num">57</span>
<p class="indent">There is a difference between those rights on which the validity of the transactions of the corporation depends, which must adhere to those transactions every where, and those peculiar remedies which may be bestowed on it. The first are of general obligation; the last, from their nature, can only be exercised in those courts which the power making the grant can regulate. The act of incorporation, then, conferred on the bank of Alexandria a corporate character, but could give that corporate body no peculiar privileges in the courts of the United States not belonging to it as a corporation. Those privileges do not exist, unless conferred by an act of congress.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p58">
<span class="num">58</span>
<p class="indent">The mere saving in an act of congress which expressly renders all judgments of the circuit court, for a larger sum than one hundred dollars, re-examinable by writ of error in this court, cannot be considered as exempting judgments rendered in favour of the bank, from the operation of this general enacting clause respecting writs of error. If the act of March, 1801, be considered as giving the bank a right to proceed in the circuit court for Alexandria, in the same manner as by the act of incorporation, it might proceed in Virginia, yet that act does not affect the writ of error as given in the act of the 27th of February.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p59">

<p>The error assigned consists in both the admission and the operation of the testimony. So far as evidence of the existence of a deed went to show the nature of the possession which accompanied the deed, so far it was admissible; but it was not in itself evidence of any title in the plaintiff. There was no error, therefore, in admitting the testimony as to the deed.</p>
<p>But in overruling the prayer to instruct the jury, "that at the time the gift was said to be made, no gift of a slave was valid unless made in writing, which writing was afterwards reduced to record," the court below is to be considered as having given an opinion that a parol gift was good. This court is, therefore, of opinion, that the court below erred in refusing to give the latter part of the instruction prayed by the defendant.</p>

The plea avers that the consideration money was paid to the tax-gatherer; that he had a right to sell the land for default in payment of taxes; that the taxes were not paid at the time of sale, which was publicly made, after legal notice; that Daniel Course took immediate possession, and died seised thereof, and at his death it descended to his heirs, of whom the defendant Elizabeth is one.

<p class="indent">2. But if these defects of the plea should be considered as cured by the replication, yet it appears upon the whole record that the facts of the plea are not true, and that the sale of the collector transferred no right in the land to Daniel Course.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p34">
<span class="num">34</span>
<p class="indent">1st. The sale and conveyance were fraudulent and void.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p35">
<span class="num">35</span>
<p class="indent">2d. The collector had no authority, under the circumstances of the case, to sell; and if he had authority, he has not executed it legally.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p36">
<span class="num">36</span>
<p class="indent">1. The sale was fraudulent. The circumstances indicating fraud are, that the lands were liable in equity to the debts of John Rae. That the taxes were not paid for 1790 and 1791, although there was personal estate enough in the hands of the representatives of Robert Rae, in whose occupation the lands were, to pay them. This appears by Hammond's return of property, in which he has returned 56 negroes as the property of Robert Rae. That notwithstanding this personal property was in his hands, Hammond, who had married Robert Rae's widow, the mother of the defendant Elizabeth Course, not only permitted the land to be sold for taxes, but requested it might be sold, and pointed out this very land as the object of sale. The advertisement described the land by its least notorious appellation. It mentions neither the name of the owner of the land, nor the amount of taxes due. Hammond's son-in-law, the husband of the defendant, became the purchaser. There can be no doubt that he must have known the situation of the estate. He knew it was liable for the debts of John Rae. He knew that there was personal estate sufficient to pay the taxes. He knew that his father-in-law ought to have paid them; and he knew that he had directed the collector to sell the land. He knew the price which he gave for the land was far below its value; for the bill states it was sold in 1799 for 2,386 dollars, and the defendant, in her answer, says that it was then sold far below its value. He and his father-in-law and their wives were the representatives of Robert Rae, and were the only persons, except creditors, who were interested in the lands. These circumstances go strongly to show that the sale by the collector was only the means used to defeat the creditors of their just debts.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p37">
<span class="num">37</span>
<p class="indent">2. The collector had no authority to sell these lands for taxes.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p38">
<span class="num">38</span>
<p class="indent">1st. Because there was sufficient personal property, of which he had notice by the return of Hammond.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p39">
<span class="num">39</span>
<p class="indent">2d. Because he was not authorised in any case to sell more land than was sufficient to pay the taxes. The price which Daniel Course gave at this pretended sale was 552 dollars; the same lands, in 1799, sold under the decree of the court for 2,386 dollars, which the defendant in her answer says was far below their value, and yet the utmost amount of taxes which could be claimed, even supposing that all the taxes for 1790 and 1791, due from the estate of Robert Rae, for property wherever situated in Georgia, could be charged upon this one tract of land, would not exceed 150 dollars; and if, as we contend, this tract is liable for its own taxes only, the amount could not exceed 10 or 12 dollars. All special authorities are to be <i>rigidly pursued</i> and <i>strictly construed. Cowp.</i> 26.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p40">
<span class="num">40</span>
<p class="indent">3d. Because the collector could not sell after the first The 15th of December was the time limited for the debtors to pay their taxes, and from that time till the 1st of March was allowed to the collector to enforce payment by distress and sale; and on that day he was bound to close his accounts, and pay over the monies collected to the treasurer. Whether he had collected or not, he was bound to pay; and the law did not give him this summary remedy to indemnify himself for any taxes he might advance. If it did, it must give him a lien for an indefinite time, which cannot be supposed to have been the intention of the legislature. It is a special power, of an extrajudicial nature, to perform a duty in a certain time, and he is bound to pursue his authority strictly. If he paid the taxes which he had not collected, the power to distrain did not continue for his benefit. It is to be presumed that he did his duty, unless the contrary appears, and that he did pay the taxes which he was bound to collect, and had failed to collect, at the time when he was bound to close his accounts.</p>

It is simply called 450 acres of land lying on <i>Pipemaker's creek</i>, without mentioning the <i>Savannah</i> river, on which it was also bounded, and which was a more notorious object. It neither mentions the person from whom the taxes were due, nor their amount, nor the name of the owner of the land.

<p class="indent">MARSHALL, Ch. J. delivered the opinion of the court, as follows:</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p64">
<span class="num">64</span>
<p class="indent">The plaintiffs, who were the creditors of Rae and Somerville, brought this bill to subject a tract of land in the possession of the defendants to the payment of a debt for which they had obtained a decree against Rae and Somerville.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p65">
<span class="num">65</span>
<p class="indent">The defendants plead that Daniel Course, under whom they claim by descent, is a fair purchaser, for a valuable consideration, of the premises in question, at a sale thereof, by the collector of taxes for the county in which they lie, made for taxes in arrear. The defendant also answered, denying fraud.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p66">
<span class="num">66</span>
<p class="indent">A replication was filed to this plea, and on a hearing it was sustained, and the bill dismissed.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p67">
<span class="num">67</span>
<p class="indent">In this case the merits of the claim cannot be examined. The only questions before this court are upon the sufficiency of the plea to bar the action, and the sufficiency of the testimony to support the plea as pleaded.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p68">
<span class="num">68</span>
<p class="indent">On the first point, the counsel for the plaintiff has adduced authority which would certainly apply strongly, if not conclusively in his favour, if a special demurrer had been filed to the plea: But as issue has been taken on it, the court thinks it sufficient, since it contains, in substance, matter which, if true, would bar the action.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p69">
<span class="num">69</span>
<p class="indent">The replication puts the matter of the plea in issue, and it is incumbent on the defendants to support it. They prove a sale by the collector on account of taxes, and adduce a deed conveying the premises to the purchaser. But this testimony alone is not sufficient to support the plea. The validity of the sale is the subject of controversy, and its validity depends on the authority of the collector to sell, and on the fairness of the transaction. It would be going too far to say that a collector selling land with or without authority, could, by his conveyance, transfer the title of the rightful proprietor. He must act in conformity with the law from which his power is derived, and the purchaser is bound to inquire whether he has so acted. It is true that full evidence of every minute circumstance ought not, especially at a distant day, to be required. From the establishment of some facts, it is possible that others may be presumed, and less than positive testimony may establish facts. In this case, as in all others depending on testimony, a sound discretion, regulated by the law of evidence, will be exercised. But it is incumbent on the vendee to prove the authority to sell, and the question respecting the fairness of the sale will then stand on the same principles with any other transaction in which fraud is charged.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p70">
<span class="num">70</span>
<p class="indent">In examining the law under which this sale was made, the court perceives that the collector is authorised to sell land only on the deficiency of personal estate; and then to sell only so much as is necessary to pay the tax in arrear. In this case a sale is made of a whole tract of land, without specifying the amount of taxes actually due for which that land was liable and could be sold. This is proceeding in a manner not strictly regular. The sale ought to have been of so much of the land as would satisfy the tax in arrear. Should it be true that the land was actually liable for the whole sum for which it sold, it would still be incumbent on the vendee to prove that fact; for it cannot be presumed. Every presumption arising from the testimony in the cause is against it.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p71">
<span class="num">71</span>
<p class="indent">Had this fact been established, the court is inclined to think that the circumstances of the case as stated, though not perhaps amounting to proof of fraud, afford such presumptions as would render a final decree, without further testimony, unsatisfactory, and that an issue ought to have been directed on the question whether the sale was fraudulent or not. But if a whole tract of land was sold when a small part of it would have been sufficient for the taxes, which at present appears to be the case, the collector unquestionably exceeded his authority, and the plea cannot be substained.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p72">
<span class="num">72</span>
<p class="indent">It is, therefore, the opinion of the court, that there is error in the decree of the circuit court for the district of Georgia, in sustaining the plea of the defendants, and dismissing the bill of the plaintiffs, and that the said decree ought to be reversed and annulled, and the cause remanded, with directions that the defendants shall answer over, and that further proceedings be had in the said cause, according to equity.</p>

<p class="parties">HIGGINSON<br/>v.<br/>MEIN.</p>
<p class="date">February Term, 1808</p>
<div class="prelims">
<p class="indent">THIS was an appeal from a decree of the circuit court for the district of Georgia, which dismissed the complainant's bill brought to foreclose a mortgage.</p>
<p class="indent">The facts, as stated by <i>Marshall</i>, Ch. J. in delivering the opinion of the court, were as follows:</p>
<p class="indent">In November, 1769, Alexander Wylly, then residing in Georgia, executed his bond to Greenwood and Higginson, merchants of London, for the sum of 2,108<i>l.</i> 4<i>s.</i> sterling, conditioned to pay 1,054<i>l.</i> 2<i>s.</i> like money, on or before the 1st of January, 1773; and also executed a deed of mortgage, (which was admitted to record in the secretary's office) to secure the payment of the bond. Alexander Wylly took part with the British in the war of our revolution, in consequence of which his estate was confiscated, and commissioners were appointed to take possession of it and to sell it. In 1784, the mortgaged premises were sold and conveyed by the commissioners to certain persons in Savannah, who sold and conveyed them to James Houston, who retained peaceable possession of them until his death. In 1796 these lands were sold under execution by the marshal, to satisfy a judgment obtained against James Mossman, as executor of James Houston. The purchaser at the marshal's sale had notice of the mortgage deed to Greenwood and Higginson.</p>
<p class="indent">This suit is brought against the agent of the purchaser, [to whom notice was given, and to whom the purchaser has since conveyed his right,] in order to obtain payment of the debt due from Wylly, and to foreclose all equity of redemption in the mortgaged premises. The bill was filed on the 4th of November, 1802.</p>
<p class="indent"><i>P. B. Key</i>, for the appellant.</p>
<p class="indent">The treaty of peace of 1783 removed all legal impediments to the recovery of debts. By the fourth article, 'It is agreed that creditors on either side shall meet with no lawful impediment to the recovery of the full value in sterling money, of all <i>bona fide</i> debts heretofore contracted.' And by the 5th article, 'It is agreed that all persons who have any interest in confiscated lands, either <i>by debts</i>, marriage settlements, or otherwise, shall meet with no lawful impediment in the prosecution of their just rights.' At the time of the treaty, this land was not sold, but holden by the state under the confiscation act. After the treaty, the state held it subject to the mortgage, and could sell only such right as it had. It could at most sell Wylly's right of redemption.</p>
<p class="indent"><i>Harper</i>, contra.</p>
<p class="indent">The estate both of the mortgagor and mortgagees in this land was confiscated, and vested in the state of Georiga. If the treaty is to set up the title, no estate of a British subject indebted to a British subject could ever be confiscated; for the land may be the only fund out of which the creditor can get payment.</p>
<p class="indent">The impediments intended to be removed by the treaty were only <i>legal</i> impediments, not every thing which went to impair the <i>security;</i> not that which merely rendered the debtor less able to pay. Confiscations were not included under the expression legal impediments, because there is a separate provision for the case of confiscations. If confiscations were meant to be included in the expression, it might as well be extended to any general acts of the legislature by which the debtor's means of payment may be diminished. This being a particular lien, does not differ the case from that of a general lien. Every judgment-creditor had a lien upon all the lands of his debtor, and if all these liens are saved by the treaty, there were very few confiscations which it would not annul.</p>
<p class="indent">The fifth article of the treaty extends no further than the fourth.</p>
<p class="indent">MARSHALL, Ch. J. The decisions of this court have been uniform, that the acts of the states, confiscating debts, are repealed by the treaty; and if, in this case, the debt remains, does not the security remain also? Is not the remedy as much protected by the treaty, as the debt itself?</p>
<p class="indent"><i>Harper</i>. We contend not.</p>
<p class="indent">The lapse of 30 years induces a presumption that the bond is satisfied. We do not rely upon the statute of limitations, but the general presumption. In England, it is decided that the presumption arises by the lapse of 20 years without a demand or payment of interest.</p>
<p class="indent">MARSHALL, Ch. J. The period of 20 years is fixed upon in case of a bond, because in that time the interest at five per cent equals the principal; and no further interest is covered by the penalty of the bond.</p>
<p class="indent"><i>Harper</i>. That is not the reason stated in the English books.</p>
<p class="indent">But the reason is, that a man is presumed to depend upon the interest of his money as a revenue.</p>
<p class="indent">The fact of the plaintiff's being beyond seas does not remove the presumption, because both parties were equally beyond seas, and probably both within one jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="indent"><i>P. B. Key</i>, in reply.</p>
<p class="indent">The fifth article of the treaty expressly provides for the case. How can a man have an interest, <i>by debt</i>, in confiscated lands, unless it be by mortgage, or other lien. The practice in Maryland has always been to protect such liens.</p>
<p class="indent">LIVINGSTON, J. I have never heard that confiscated property has been restored by force of the treaty. The treaty only provides that congress shall <i>recommend</i> such restitution.</p>

<p class="indent">It is contended on the part of the purchaser,</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p4">

<p class="indent">1st. That the lands are exonerated from the mortgage by the confiscation and sale thereof made by the state of Georgia.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p5">
<span class="num">5</span>
<p class="indent">2d. That they are exonerated by the length of time which has intervened since that confiscation and sale, during which an adverse possession has been held.</p>

<span class="num">6</span>
<p class="indent">3d. That payment of the mortgage is to be presumed.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p7">
<span class="num">7</span>
<p class="indent">Several acts of confiscation were passed during the war by the state of Georgia, in which the name of Alexander Wylly is to be found. That under which the defendants in this case claim, was made in the month of May, in the year 1782. That act contains also a clause confiscating generally the estates of British subjects, with the exception of debts due to merchants residing in Great Britain, which were sequestered. The debt due to Greenwood and Higginson came within this exception, and the majority of the court is of opinion, that the lien given by the mortgage on the land of Wylly, for the security of that debt, was not confiscated.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p8">
<span class="num">8</span>
<p class="indent">The estate of Wylly, not the interest of Greenwood and Higginson in that estate, being confiscated, it is not to be inferred that the lien of Greenwood and Higginson on that estate was discharged. The treaty of peace was made while the estate remained unsold. The fifth article of the treaty, after discovering much solicitude on the part of Great Britain for the entire restoration of confiscated estates, concludes with this clause: 'And it is agreed, that all persons who have any interest in confiscated lands, either by debts, marriage settlements, or otherwise, shall meet with no lawful impediment in the prosecution of their just rights.'</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p9">
<span class="num">9</span>
<p class="indent">This article applies to those cases where an actual confiscation has taken place, and stipulates expressly, that in such cases the interest of all persons having a lien upon such lands shall be preserved. Neither the confiscation, nor any act in consequence of the confiscation, can constitute a legal impediment to the prosecution of their just rights. The preceding part of the article had contemplated sales of the confiscated property, and consequently this clause must have been intended to charge the lands, even in the hands of a purchaser. But respecting its application to this particular case, the court cannot conceive a doubt. The lands, at the time of the treaty, remained unsold, and the government, claiming them as confiscated, stipulates through the proper constituted authorities for their liability to this mortgage. If, then, the act of confiscation, independent of the treaty, would be construed to destroy the claim of the mortgagee, the treaty reinstates the lien in its full force, and the subsequent sale of the property could only pass it with the burden imposed upon it.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p10">
<span class="num">10</span>
<p class="indent">2d. Is this remedy barred by the act of limitations?</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p11">
<span class="num">11</span>
<p class="indent">Upon an attentive consideration of that act, it appears to be intended for suits at law, claiming the lands themselves, not to suits in equity for the purpose of subjecting the lands to the payment of debts for which they are mortgaged. The words of the law would lead to that opinion, and it is confirmed by the consideration that, in such cases, the possession of the mortgagor, or those claiming under him, is not adverse to, but is compatible with, the rights of the mortgagee. Unless, therefore, this statute has been otherwise construed in Georgia, it would not be considered as applicable to such a case as this. But this point must be decided in favour of the plaintiffs, because there is a saving in the act of the rights of persons beyond sea.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p12">
<span class="num">12</span>
<p class="indent">3d. Is payment in this case to be presumed?</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p13">
<span class="num">13</span>
<p class="indent">The length of time which elapsed between the day when this bond and mortgage became payable, and that on which the suit was instituted is certainly sufficient to warrant a presumption of payment. But this presumption may be met by circumstances which account for the delay in bringing this suit. In this case, the war, and those events which succeeded the war, have not the same influence as in ordinary cases of British debts, because the debtor was within the reach of his creditor from the date of his banishment in the year 1778, and might have been sued. It does not sufficiently appear in the proceedings where he was, nor what was his situation, to enable the court to judge whether the long delay in bringing this suit is or is not sufficiently accounted for. Neither is it shown satisfactorily that Alexander Wylly has left no personal representative who might show payment of this debt. If there be a personal representative of Alexander Wylly in existence, such person ought to be a party to this suit; if there be no personal representative, some evidence that there is none ought to be adduced. In any event, under all the circumstances of this case, enough does not appear to enable the court to decide whether payment ought to be presumed, or whether the delay in instituting this suit can be accounted for, and the court is therefore of opinion that an issue ought to have been directed by the circuit court, for the purpose of ascertaining the fact of payment. The decree of the circuit court is therefore to be reversed, and the cause remanded to that court, with instructions to direct an issue to determine whether the bond in the bill mentioned has been paid, and with liberty to the plaintiff to amend his bill, and make new parties, if he shall desire it.</p>

GODFREY.</h1></center>
<center><p><b>Supreme Court of United States.</b></p></center>
<center></center>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*322</span> JOHNSON, J.<sup>[*]</sup> delivered the opinion of the court, as follows:</p>
<p>This case rests upon the single question, Whether a subject of Great Britain, born before the declaration of independence, can now inherit lands in this country? The general doctrine is admitted, that in the state of Maryland, in which the land lies, an alien cannot take by descent; but it is contended, upon the doctrine laid down in Calvin's case, that the rights of the antenati of Great Britain formed an exception from the general rule. The point decided in the case of Calvin was, that a Scotsman, born after the union, could inherit lands in England. It is evident that this case is not directly in point, for the only objection here to the right of recovery did not exist in Calvin's case, as, whether in England or in Scotland, he was equally bound in allegiance to the king of Great Britain. It would be a contradiction in terms to contend that Dawson or his wife ever owed allegiance to a government which did not exist at their birth. It is upon a supposed analogy, therefore, and the reasoning of the judges in Calvin's case, that the argument for the plaintiffs is founded. In the two cases of Coxe and M`Ilvaine and Lambert and Payne, in this court, this doctrine was very amply discussed, and this case is submitted upon those arguments. The counsel there contended, that the relation of the postnati of Scotland (after the union) to the subjects of Great Britain, was identically the same with the antenati of Great Britain (before our revolution) to the citizens of this country, and that the community of allegiance at the time of birth, and not the existing state of it when the descent is cast, is the principle upon which the right to inherit depends.</p>
<p>The latter proposition presents the weak point of their argument, for the community of allegiance at the time of <span class="star-pagination">*323</span> birth and at the time of descent both existed in Calvin's case. And if the court in their argument expressed opinions which appear to go the length contended for by the counsel, they must be considered as mere obiter opinions, since the decision of the cause did not depend upon them. We have no doubt that the correct doctrine of the English law is, that the right to inherit depends upon the existing state of allegiance at the time of the descent cast. And that the idea that it depends upon community of allegiance at the time of birth, is a consequence that follows from the doctrines that a man can never put off his allegiance, or be deprived of the benefits of it but for a crime. Community of allegiance once existing must, upon these principles, exist ever after. Hence it is that the antenati of America may continue to inherit in Great Britain, because we once owed allegiance to that crown. But the same reason does not extend to the antenati of Great Britain, because they never owed allegiance to our government. This idea will be best elucidated in the following manner: If an action be commenced in England by an antenatus of America for the recovery of land, the plea of alien born could not be maintained, because inconsistent with the fact; nor would a plea of the severance of these states avail the defendant, because the act of his government, independent of any crime of his own, does not deprive the plaintiff of his civil rights, although it may release him from the obligation of allegiance. But if a suit of the same kind be instituted here by an antenatus of Great Britain, the plea of alien born could be maintained, for the plaintiff never owed allegiance to our government. To avoid it he would be put to a special replication, by which he must of necessity acknowledge the truth of the plea, and set forth circumstances which would amount to a recognition of his never having been a party in our social compact. Much of the difficulty in satisfying the mind on this subject vanishes upon a just view of the nature of the right of inheritance. Gentlemen have argued upon it as if it were a natural and perfect right; whereas it has its origin in, and is modified to infinity by the laws of society, in exercise of the right of territorial jurisdiction. To be entitled to inherit in the state of Maryland, a right should be made out under the laws of that state. As the common law, which is the law of Maryland on this subject, <span class="star-pagination">*324</span> deprives an alien generally of the right of inheriting, it is incumbent upon the plaintiff to establish some exception in favour of his case. But I know of no exception, at common law, which gives the right to inherit distinctly from the obligation of allegiance, existing either in fact or in supposition of law.</p>

<p><span class="star-pagination">*428</span> MARSHALL, Ch. J. delivered the opinion of the court as follows, viz.</p>
<p>In this case objections have been made to the jurisdiction of the circuit court, and to the proceedings in that court.</p>
<p>The point of jurisdiction made by the plaintiffs in error is considered as free from all doubt. By appearing to the action, the defendants in the court below placed themselves precisely in the situation in which <span class="star-pagination">*429</span> they would have stood, had process been served upon them, and consequently waived all objections to the non-service of process. Were it otherwise, the duty of the circuit court would have been to remand the cause to the state court in which it was instituted, and this court would be bound now to direct that proceeding. As little foundation is there for the exception taken to the manner in which the circuit court was constituted. That court consists of two judges, any one of whom is capable of performing judicial duties. So this court consists of seven judges, any four of whom may act. It has never been supposed that the death of three of the judges would disqualify the remaining four from discharging their official duties until the vacant seats of their departed brethren should be filled. There is nothing in the peculiar phraseology of that part of the judicial act which establishes the circuit courts, that requires a different construction of the words authorising a single judge to hold those courts, from what is usually given in other cases, to clauses authorising a specified number of justices to constitute a court.</p>
<p>The exceptions taken to the proceedings of the circuit court are more serious. These are,</p>
<p>1. To the pleadings.</p>
<p>2. To the opinions of that court, admitting certain testimony in support of the action.</p>
<p>The objections to the pleadings are,</p>
<p>That the different parts of the declaration are repugnant to each other; and that the declaration is itself insufficient, as the foundation of a judgment.</p>
<p>In deciding on so much of this objection as depends on the laws of Connecticut, this court would certainly be guided by the construction given by that state to its own statute; and, if it was indispensably necessary now to decide that question, the evidence in favour of the construction maintained by the defendants in error would seem to preponderate.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*430</span> Another objection taken to the declaration is, that it ought to have alleged a disseisin of the plaintiffs below, in order to enable them to maintain their action.</p>
<p>On this part of the case, the court can only consider whether the declaration in itself, unconnected with the testimony which was adduced to support it, is so radically defective, that a judgment cannot be rendered on it. This leads to the inquiry, whether the covenant of the vendors can be broken, as stated in the declaration, although no eviction has taken place; and the court is of opinion that it may be so broken. 9 Co. 60.</p>
<p>The covenant is, that the vendor is seised in fee of the premises which he sells and conveys. Suppose the fact to be that he had no title nor pretence of title to those premises; that he had conveyed lands for which he had never received a patent or a title of any kind. Could it be said that his covenant that he was seised in fee remained unbroken until the real proprietor should think proper to eject the vendee? This question, in the opinion of the court, must be answered in the negative. The testimony, which would be sufficient to establish the breach assigned, may be a subject for serious consideration, but on the sufficiency of the breach as assigned to support a judgment, there is no doubt.</p>
<p>The exceptions to the testimony admitted in the circuit court consists of two parts.</p>
<p>1st. To the admission of certain copies of surveys made for Wilson Carey Nicholas, connected with the testimony of Erastus Granger, describing the face of the country on which the surveys purported to be made.</p>
<p>2d. To the admission of parol testimony to prove prior titles to the lands conveyed in the deed on which this suit was instituted.</p>
<p>1. The surveys of Wilson Carey Nicholas, and the explanatory testimony of Granger, were introduced for the purpose of showing that the patent for the lands sold by Pollard and Pickett was void, because it issued on a <span class="star-pagination">*431</span> plat representing a survey which, in point of fact, could not have been made.</p>
<p>In examining this exception, it becomes proper to inquire what was the real issue between the parties.</p>
<p>The plaintiffs below averred in their declaration that the defendants were not seised and possessed of any estate whatever in the land and premises, nor in any part thereof, nor had they or either of them good right and lawful authority to sell and convey the same. The defendants, in their plea, do not set forth their title, but say generally that they were seised of the land sold and conveyed by them, and had good right to sell and convey the same, as is expressed by their deed. On this plea an issue is tendered, which is joined by the plaintiffs.</p>
<p>To prove that the survey on which the patent granting the lands to the defendants was issued could not have been made, the plaintiffs produced two other surveys made by the same person for Wilson Carey Nicholas, which were said to be completed only two days succeeding the completion of the survey of the defendants, which three several surveys could not possibly have been made in the time intervening between the entries in the surveyor's office and the day on which they are alleged to have been completed, whence the jury might conclude that the survey of Pollard and Pickett was not made.</p>
<p>The surveyor was a sworn officer, and his survey was returned upon oath. This is an attempt to invalidate the evidence derived from his official return, by a particular fact which has no relation to the cause before the court, and with which the parties to this controversy have no connection. Had it even appeared that the copies offered in evidence were authenticated, they would, on this account, have been inadmissible.</p>
<p>This whole testimony is inadmissible on other ground. Were it even true that this patent is voidable, if the surveyor had not run round all the lines of the land, a <span class="star-pagination">*432</span> point not yet established, it cannot be deemed absolutely void; it cannot be deemed a mere nullity. While it remains in force it is a valid title, and vests the fee-simple estate in the patentee. In this action, and on the trial of this issue, the question whether the patent be voidable by Virginia or not, is not properly examinable. Testimony, therefore, tending to establish that point, is irrelevant and inadmissible.</p>
<p>2. But had the court enteritaned any doubt on this point, the second part of the exception would be clearly decisive with regard to this judgment.</p>
<p>Parol testimony is admitted to show prior claims to the land in controversy. The defendants in error attempt to defend the admission of this testimony, by supposing it auxiliary to other testimony which had previously established the validity of those claims, and that this witness was only adduced to show that those claims covered this land. Had the fact supported the argument, a private ex parte survey would have been a very improper mode of establishing it; but the language of the exception excludes that construction of the opinion which the counsel for the defendants in error would put upon it. The proof offered and admitted is, not that those particular titles which were exhibited and proved to the court covered the land conveyed by Pollard and Pickett, but "that there were prior claims upon it to the amount of upwards of ninety thousand acres." The prior claims rest upon the oath of the witness. If those claims were valid, their validity was established by his testimony, which cannot be tolerated on any legal principle; if they were mere claims, not good titles, they ought not to have been stated to the jury. They were irrelevant to the point in issue.</p>
<p>Upon the whole, the court is unanimously of opinion, that the circuit court erred in permitting the copies of surveys made for Wilson Carey Nicholas, and the testimony of Erastus Granger, to go to the jury for the purposes mentioned in the bill of exceptions, and <span class="star-pagination">*433</span> that the judgment of the circuit court must, on that account, be reversed, and the cause remanded for a new trial.<sup>[*]</sup></p>
<p>Judgment reversed.</p>
<h2>NOTES</h2>
<p>[*]  After the opinion of the court was delivered, Lee prayed that the cause might be remanded, with leave for the defendants below to amend their pleadings.
</p>
<p>The Court said, that the court below had the power to grant leave to amend, and this court could not doubt but it would do what was right, in that respect.</p>

<h2>March 15.</h2>
<p>JOHNSON, J.</p>
<p>The action below was instituted on a policy of insurance.</p>
<p>On behalf of the insurers, it was contended that the policy was forfeited by committing a breach of blockade. It is not, and cannot be made a question, that this is one of those acts which will exonerate the underwriters from their liability. The only point below was relative to the evidence upon which the commission of <span class="star-pagination">*435</span> the act may be substantiated. A sentence of a British prize court in Barbadoes was given in evidence, by which it appeared that the vessel was condemned for attempting to commit a breach of blockade. It is the English doctrine, and the correct doctrine on the law of nations, that an attempt to commit a breach of blockade is a violation of belligerent rights, and authorises capture. This doctrine is not denied, but the plaintiff contends that he did not commit such an attempt, and the court below permitted evidence to go to the jury to disprove the fact on which the condemnation professes to proceed.</p>
<p>On this point, I am of opinion that the court below erred.</p>
<p>I do not think it necessary to go through the mass of learning on this subject, which has so often been brought to the notice of this court, and particularly in the case of Fitzsimmons, argued at this term. Nearly the whole of it will be found very well summed up in the 18th chapter of Mr. Park's Treatise. The doctrine appears to me to rest upon three very obvious considerations: the propriety of leaving the cognizance of prize questions exclusively to courts of prize jurisdiction Â— the very great inconvenience amounting nearly to an impossibility of fully investigating such cases in a court of common law Â— and the impropriety of revising the decisions of the maritime courts of other nations, whose jurisdiction is co-ordinate throughout the world.</p>
<p>It is sometimes contended that this doctrine is novel, and that it takes its origin in an incorrect extension of the principle in Hughes v. Cornelius. I am induced to believe that it is coeval with the species of contract to which it is applied. Policies of insurance are known to have been brought into England from a country that acknowledged the civil law. This must have been the law of policies at the time when they were considered as contracts proper for the admiralty jurisdiction, and were submitted to the court of policies established in the reign of Elizabeth. It is probable that, at the time when the common law assumed to itself exclusive jurisdiction of the contract of insurance, the rule was <span class="star-pagination">*436</span> too much blended with the law of policies to have been dispensed with, had it even been inconsistent with common law principles. But, in fact, the common law had sufficient precedent for this rule, in its own received principles relative to sentences of the civil law courts of England. It may be true that there are no cases upon this subject prior to that of Hughes v. Cornelius, but this does not disprove the existence of the doctrine. There can be little necessity for reporting decisions upon questions that cannot be controverted. Since the case of Hughes v. Cornelius, the doctrine has frequently been brought to the notice of the courts of Great Britain in insurance cases, but always with a view to contest its applicability to particular cases, or to restrict the general doctrine by exceptions, but the existence of the rule, or its applicability to actions on policies, is no where controverted.</p>
<p>I am of opinion that the sentence of condemnation was conclusive evidence of the commission of the offence for which the vessel was condemned, and as that offence was one which vitiated the policy, the defendants ought to have had a verdict.</p>
<p>WASHINGTON, J. The single question in this case is, whether the sentence of the admiralty court at Barbadoes, condemning the brig Fame and her cargo as prize, for an attempt to break the blockade of Martinique, is conclusive evidence against the insured, to falsify his warranty of neutrality, notwithstanding the fact stated in the sentence as the ground of condemnation is negatived by the jury?</p>
<p>This question has long been at rest in England. The established law upon this subject in the courts of that country is, that the sentence of a foreign court of competent jurisdiction condemning the property upon the ground that it was not neutral, is so entirely conclusive of the fact so decided, that it can never be controverted, directly or collaterally, in any other court having concurrent jurisdiction.</p>
<p>This doctrine seems to result from the application of a legal principle which prevails in respect to domestic <span class="star-pagination">*437</span> judgments, to the judgments and sentences of foreign courts.</p>
<p>It is a well established rule in England, that the judgment, sentence, or decree of a court of exclusive jurisdiction directly upon the point, may be given in evidence as conclusive between the same parties, upon the same matter coming incidentally in question in another court for a different purpose. It is not only conclusive of the right which it establishes, but of the fact which it directly decides.</p>
<p>This rule, when applied to the sentences of courts of admiralty, whether foreign or domestic, produces the doctrine which I am now considering, upon the ground that all the world are parties in an admiralty cause. The proceedings are in rem, but any person having an interest in the property may interpose a claim, or may prosecute an appeal from the sentence. The insured is emphatically a party, and in every instance has an opportunity to controvert the alleged grounds of condemnation, by proving, if he can, the neutrality of the property. The master is his immediate agent, and he is also bound to act for the benefit of all concerned, so that, in this respect, he also represents the insurer. That irregularities have sometimes taken place, to the exclusion of a fair hearing of the parties, is not to be denied. But this furnishes no good reason against the adoption of a general rule. A spirit of comity has induced the courts of England to presume that foreign tribunals, whether of prize or municipal jurisdiction, will act fairly, and will decide according to the laws which ought to govern them; and public convenience seems to require that a question, which has once been fairly decided, should not be again litigated between the same parties, unless in a court of appellate jurisdiction.</p>
<p>The irregular and unjust decisions of the French courts of admiralty of late years, have induced even English judges to doubt of the wisdom of the above doctrine in relation to foreign sentences, but which they have acknowledged to be too well established for English tribunals to shake; and the justice with which the same <span class="star-pagination">*438</span> charge is made by all neutral nations against the English as well as against the French courts of admiralty, during the same period, has led many American jurists to question the validity of the doctrine in the courts of our own country. It is said to be a novel doctrine, lately sprung up, and acted upon as a rule of decision in the English courts, since the period when English decisions have lost the weight of authority in the courts of the United States. It is this position which I shall now examine, acknowledging that I do not hold myself bound by such decisions made since the revolution, although, as evidence of what the law was prior to that period, I read and respect them.</p>
<p>The authority of the case of Hughes v. Cornelius, the earliest we meet with as to the conclusiveness of a foreign sentence, is admitted; but its application to a question arising under a warranty of neutrality between the insurer and insured, is denied. It is true that, in that case, the only point expressly decided was, that the sentence was conclusive as to the change of property effected by the condemnation. But it is obvious that the point decided in that case depended, not upon some new principle peculiar to the sentences of foreign courts, but upon the application of a general rule of law to such sentences.</p>
<p>This case, as far as it goes, places a foreign sentence upon the same foundation as the sentence or decree of an English court acting upon the same subject; and we have seen that, by the general rule of law, the latter, if conclusive at all, is so as to the fact directly decided, as well as to the change of property produced by the establishment of the fact. Hence it would seem to follow, that if the sentence of a foreign court of admiralty be conclusive as to the property, it is equally conclusive of the matter or fact directly decided. What is the matter decided in the case under consideration? Â— That the vessel was seized whilst attempting to break a blockade, in consequence of which she lost her neutral character; and the change of property produced by the sentence of condemnation is a consequence of the matter decided, that she was, in effect, enemy-property. Can the parties to that sentence be bound by so much of <span class="star-pagination">*439</span> it as works a loss of the property, because it was declared to be enemy-property, and yet be left free to litigate anew in some other form, the very point decided from which this consequence flowed? Or upon what just principle, let me ask, shall a party to a suit, who has once been heard, and whose rights have been decided by a competent tribunal, be permitted in another court of concurrent jurisdiction, and, in a different form of action, to litigate the same question, and to take another chance for obtaining a different result? I confess I am strongly inclined to think that the case of Hughes v. Cornelius laid a strong foundation for the doctrine which was built upon it, and which for many years past has been established law in England. This opinion is given with the more confidence, when I find it sanctioned by the positive declarations of distinguished law characters Â— men who are, of all others, the best able to testify respecting the course of decisions upon the doctrine I am examining, and the source from which it sprung.</p>
<p>In the case of Lothian v. Henderson, 3 Bos. &amp; Pull. 499. Chambre, J. speaking upon this point, says that the sentence of the French court was in that case conclusive against the claim of the assured, "agreeable to all the decisions upon the subject, beginning with the case of Hughes v. Cornelius, (confirmed as that was by the opinion of Lord Holt in two subsequent cases,) and pursuing them down to the present period. It is true," he observes, "that in Hughes v. Cornelius, the question upon the foreign sentence arose in an action of trover, and not in an action on a policy of assurance, where the non-compliance with a warranty of neutrality is in dispute. But from that period to the present, the doctrine there laid down respecting foreign sentences has been considered equally applicable to questions of warranty in actions on policies, as to questions of property in actions of trover." Le Blanc, J. says, "that these sentences are admissible and conclusive evidence of the fact they decide, it seems not safe now to question. From the time of Car. II. to this day, they have been received as such, without being questioned. In the discussion of the nature of such evidence before this <span class="star-pagination">*440</span> house in 1776, it seems not to have been controverted, and the cases, I may say, are numberless, and the property immense which have been determined on the conclusiveness of such evidence, in many of which cases, the forms in which they came before the courts in Westminster-Hall were such as to have enabled the parties, if any doubt had been entertained, to have brought the question before a higher tribunal." Lawrence, J. also speaking of the legal effect of a foreign sentence upon this point, says, "as to which, after the continued practice which has taken place from the earliest period, in which, in actions on policies of insurance, questions have arisen on warranties, to admit such sentences in evidence, not only as conclusive in rem, but also as conclusive of the several matters they purport to decide directly, I apprehend it is now too late to examine the practice of admitting them to the extent to which they have been received, supposing that practice might, upon the argument, have appeared to have been doubtful at first." Rooke, J. Lord Eldon, and Lord Alvanley, all concur in giving the same testimony, that the doctrine under consideration had been established for a long period of years, by a long series of adjudications in the courts of Westminster-Hall.</p>
<p>I cite this case for no other purpose but to prove by the most respectable testimony, that the case of Hughes v. Cornelius, decided in the reign of Car. II. had, by a uniform course of decisions from that time, been considered as warranting the rule now so firmly established in England. And when the inquiry is, whether the application of the principle laid down in that case to questions arising on warranties in actions on policies, be of ancient or modern date, I think I may safely rely upon the declarations of the English judges, when they concur in the evidence they give respecting the fact. It is true that no case was cited at the bar recognizing the application of the rule to questions between the insurer and insured, prior to the revolution, except that of Fernandez v. Da Costa, which I admit was a Nisi Prius decision. But were I convinced that the long series of decisions upon this point, from the time of Hughes v. Cornelius, spoken of by the judges in the case of Lothian v. Henderson, had been made at Nisi Prius, it <span class="star-pagination">*441</span> would not, in my mind, weaken the authority of the doctrine. It would prove the sense of all the judges of England, as well as of the bar, of the correctness and legal validity of the rule. It is not to be supposed that if a doubt had existed respecting the law of those decisions, the point would not have been reserved for a more deliberate examination, before some of the courts of Westminster-Hall. But the case of Fernandez v. Da Costa receives additional weight, when it is recollected that the judge who decided it was Lord Mansfield, and when upon examining it, we find no intimation from him that there was any novelty at that day in the doctrine. To this strong evidence of the antiquity of the rule, may be added that of Judge Buller, who, at the time he wrote his Nisi Prius, considered it as then established.</p>
<p>That the doctrine was considered as perfectly fixed in the year 1781, is plainly to be inferred, from the case of Bernardi v. Motteux, decided in that year. Lord Mansfield speaks of it as he would of any other well established principle of law, declaring in general terms, that the sentence, as to that which is within it, is conclusive against all persons, and cannot be collaterally controverted in any other suit. The only difficulty in that case was, to discover the real ground upon which the foreign sentence proceeded, and the court in that and many subsequent cases laid down certain principles auxiliary to the rule, for the purpose of ascertaining the real import of the sentence in relation to the fact decided as between the insurer and insured. For if the sentence did not proceed upon the ground of the property not being neutral, it of course concluded nothing against the insured; since upon no other ground could the sentence be said to falsify the warranty.</p>
<p>It was admitted by the counsel for the insured, that, as between him and the insurer, the sentence is prima facie evidence of a non-compliance with the warranty. But if they are right in their arguments as to the inconclusiveness of the sentence, I would ask for the authority upon which the sentence can be considered as prima facie evidence. Certainly no case was referred <span class="star-pagination">*442</span> to, and I have not met with one to warrant the position. If we look to general principles applicable to domestic judgment, they are opposed to it. We have seen that the judgment is conclusive between the same parties, upon the same matter coming incidentally in question. The judgment of a foreign court is equally conclusive, except in the single instance where the party claiming the benefit of it applies to the courts in England to enforce it, in which case only the judgment is prima facie evidence. But it is to be remarked, that in such a case, the judgment is no more conclusive as to the right it establishes, than as to the fact it decides. Now it is admitted that the sentence of a foreign court of admiralty is conclusive upon the right to the property in question; upon what principle, then, can it be prima facie evidence, if not conclusive, upon the facts directly decided. A domestic judgment is not even prima facie evidence between those not parties to it, or those claiming under them, and that would clearly be the rule, and for a similar reason as to foreign judgments. If between the same parties, the former is conclusive as to the right and as to the facts decided. This principle, if applied at all to foreign sentences, which it certainly is, is either applicable throughout, upon the ground that the parties are the same, or if not so, then by analogy to the rule applying to domestic judgments, the sentence cannot be evidence at all.</p>
<p>Upon the whole, I am clearly of opinion, that the sentence of the court of admiralty at Barbadoes, condemning the brig Fame and her cargo as prize, on account of an attempt to break the blockade of Martinique, is conclusive evidence in this case against the insured, to falsify his warranty of neutrality.</p>
<p>If the injustice of the belligerent powers, and of their courts, should render this rule oppressive to the citizens of neutral nations, I can only say with the judges who decided the case of Hughes v. Cornelius, let the government in its wisdom adopt the proper means to remedy the mischief. I hold the rules of law, when once firmly established, to be beyond the controul <span class="star-pagination">*443</span> of those who are merely to pronounce what the law is, and if from any circumstance it has become impolitic, in a national point of view, it is for the nation to annul or to modify it. Till this is done, by the competent authority, I consider the rule to be inflexible.<sup>[*]</sup></p>

<center><p><b>Supreme Court of United States.</b></p></center>
<center></center>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*243</span> For the libellant, the case was argued by C. Lee, Harper, S. Chase, jun. Dallas, Rawle, Ingersoll, and Drayton, and</p>
<p>For the respondent, by Duponceau, E. Tilghman, and Martin.<sup>[*]</sup></p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*268</span> MARSHALL, Ch. J. delivered the opinion of the court.</p>
<p>This is a claim for a cargo of coffee, &amp;c. which, after being shipped from a port in Santo Domingo, in possession of the brigands, was captured by a French privateer, and carried into Barracoa, a small port in the island of Cuba, where it was sold by the captor. The cargo, having been brought by the purchaser into the state of South Carolina, was libelled in the court of admiralty, by the original American owner. The purchaser defends his title by a sentence of condemnation pronounced by a tribunal sitting in Santo Domingo, after the property had been libelled in the court of this country; and by an order of sale made by a person styling himself delegate of the French government of Santo Domingo at St. Jago de Cuba.</p>
<p>The great question to be decided is,</p>
<p>Was this sentence pronounced by a court of competent jurisdiction?</p>
<p>At the threshold of this interesting inquiry, a difficulty presents itself, which is of no inconsiderable magnitude. It is this.</p>
<p>Can this court examine the jurisdiction of a foreign tribunal?</p>
<p>The court pronouncing the sentence, of necessity decided in favour of its jurisdiction; and if the decision was erroneous, that error, it is said, ought to be corrected by the superior tribunals of its own country, not by those of a foreign country.</p>
<p>This proposition certainly cannot be admitted in its full extent. A sentence professing on its face to be the sentence of a judicial tribunal, if rendered by a selfconstituted <span class="star-pagination">*269</span> body, or by a body not empowered by its government to take cognizance of the subject it had decided, could have no legal effect whatever.</p>
<p>The power of the court then is, of necessity, examinable to a certain extent by that tribunal which is compelled to decide whether its sentence has changed the right of property. The power, under which it acts, must be looked into; and its authority to decide questions, which it professes to decide, must be considered.</p>
<p>But although the general power by which a court takes jurisdiction of causes must be inspected, in order to determine whether it may rightfully do what it professes to do, it is still a question of serious difficulty, whether the situation of the particular thing on which the sentence has passed, may be inquired into, for the purpose of deciding whether that thing was in a state which subjected it to the jurisdiction of the court passing the sentence. For example; in every case of a foreign sentence condemning a vessel as prize of war, the authority of the tribunal to act as a prize court must be examinable. Is the question, whether the vessel condemned was in a situation to subject her to the jurisdiction of that court, also examinable? This question, in the opinion of the court, must be answered in the affirmative.</p>
<p>Upon principle, it would seem that the operation of every judgment must depend on the power of the court to render that judgment; or in other words, on its jurisdiction over the subject-matter which it has determined. In some cases, that jurisdiction unquestionably depends as well on the state of the thing, as on the constitution of the court. If by any means whatever a prize court should be induced to condemn, as prize of war, a vessel which was never captured, it could not be contended that this condemnation operated a change of property. Upon principle, then, it would seem that, to a certain extent, the capacity of the court to act upon the thing condemned, arising from its being within, or without their jurisdiction, as well as the constitution of the court, may be considered by that tribunal which is to decide on the effect of the sentence.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*270</span> Passing from principle to authority, we find, that in the courts of England, whose decisions are particularly mentioned, because we are best acquainted with them, and because, as is believed, they give to foreign sentences as full effect as are given to them in any part of the civilized world, the position that the sentence of a foreign court is conclusive with respect to what it professes to decide, is uniformly qualified with the limitation that it has, in the given case, jurisdiction of the subject-matter.</p>
<p>This general dictum is explained by particular cases.</p>
<p>The case of the Flad Oyen, 1 Rob. 114. was a vessel condemned by a belligerent court sitting in a neutral territory; consequently, the objection to that sentence turned entirely on the defect in the constitution of the court.</p>
<p>The Christopher, 2 Rob. 173. was condemned while lying in the port of an ally. The jurisdiction of the court passing the sentence was affirmed, but no doubt seems to have been entertained, at the bar, or by the judge himself, of his right to decide the question, whether a court of admiralty sitting in the country of the captor could take jurisdiction of a prize lying in the port of an ally. The decision of the tribunal at Bayonne in favour of its own jurisdiction, was not considered as conclusive on the court of admiralty in England, but that question was considered as being perfectly open, and as depending on the law of nations.</p>
<p>The case of The Kierlighett, 3 Rob. 82. is of the same description with that of The Christopher, and establishes the same principle.</p>
<p>In the case of The Henrick and Maria, 4 Rob. 35. Sir W. Scott determined that a condemnation, by the court of the captor, of a vessel lying in a neutral port, was conformable to the practice of nations, and therefore valid; but in that case the right to inquire whether the situation of the thing, the locus in quo, did not take it out of the jurisdiction of the court, was considered as unquestionable.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*271</span> The case of The Comet, 5 Rob. 255. stands on the same principles.</p>
<p>The Helena, 4 Rob. 3. was a British vessel captured by an Algerine corsair owned by the Dey, and transferred to a Spanish purchaser by a public act in solemn manner before the Spanish consul. The transfer was guarantied by the Dey himself. The vessel was again transferred to a British purchaser under the public sanction of the judge of the vice-admiralty court of Minorca, after that place had surrendered to the British arms. On a claim in the court of admiralty by the original British owner, Sir W. Scott affirmed the title of the purchaser, but expressed no doubt of the right of the court to investigate the subject.</p>
<p>The manner in which this subject is understood in the courts of England, may then be considered as established on uncontrovertible authority. Although no case has been found in which the validity of a foreign sentence has been denied, because the thing was not within the ports of the captor, yet it is apparent that the courts of that country hold themselves warranted in examining the jurisdiction of a foreign court, by which a sentence of condemnation has passed, not only in relation to the constitutional powers of the court, but also in relation to the situation of the thing on which those powers are exercised; at least so far as the right of the foreign court to take jurisdiction of the thing is regulated by the law of nations and by treaties. There is no reason to suppose that the tribunals of any other country whatever deny themselves the same power. It is, therefore, at present, considered as the uniform practice of civilized nations, and is adopted by this court as the true principle which ought to govern in this case.</p>
<p>In pursuing the inquiry, then, whether the tribunal erected in St. Domingo was acting on a case of which it had jurisdiction when The Sarah was condemned, this court will examine the constitutional powers of that tribunal, the character in which it acted, and the situation of the subject on which it acted.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*272</span> Admitting that the ordinary tribunal erected in St. Domingo was capable of acting as a prize court, and also of taking cognizance of offences against regulations purely municipal, it is material to inquire in which character it pronounced the sentence of condemnation in the case now under consideration.</p>
<p>In making this inquiry, the relative situation of St. Domingo and France must necessarily be considered.</p>
<p>The colony of St. Domingo originally belonging to France, had broken the bond which connected her with the parent state, had declared herself independent, and was endeavouring to support that independence by arms. France still asserted her claim of sovereignty, and had employed a military force in support of that claim. A war de facto then unquestionably existed between France and St. Domingo. It has been argued that the colony, having declared itself a sovereign state, and having thus far maintained its sovereignty by arms, must be considered and treated by other nations as sovereign in fact, and as being entitled to maintain the same intercourse with the world that is maintained by other belligerent nations. In support of this argument, the doctrines of Vattel have been particularly referred to. But the language of that writer is obviously addressed to sovereigns, not to courts. It is for governments to decide whether they will consider St. Domingo as an independent nation, and until such decision shall be made, or France shall relinquish her claim, courts of justice must consider the ancient state of things as remaining unaltered, and the sovereign power of France over that colony as still subsisting.</p>
<p>It is not intended to say that belligerent rights may not be superadded to those of sovereignty. But admitting a sovereign who is endeavouring to reduce his revolted subjects to obedience, to possess both sovereign and belligerent rights, and to be capable of acting in either character, the manner in which he acts must determine the character of the act. If as a legislator he publishes a law ordaining punishments for certain offences, which law is to be applied by courts, the nature of the law, and of the proceedings under it, will <span class="star-pagination">*273</span> decide whether it is an exercise of belligerent rights, or exclusively of his sovereign power; and whether the court, in applying this law to particular cases, acts as a prize court, or as a court enforcing municipal regulations.</p>
<p>Let the acts of the French government which relate to this subject be inspected.</p>
<p>The notification given by Mr. Pichon, the French charge d'affaires to the American government, which was published in March, 1802, interdicts all manner of intercourse with the ports of St. Domingo, in possession of the revolted negroes, and declares that "cruisers will arrest all foreign vessels attempting to enter any other port, and to communicate with any of the revolted negroes, to carry either ammunition or provisions to them. Such vessels," he adds, "shall be confiscated, and the commanders severely punished, as violating the rights of the French Republic, and the law of nations."</p>
<p>It might be questioned, under this notice, whether vessels sailing on the high seas, having traded with one of the brigand ports, would be considered as liable to seizure and to confiscation, after passing the territorial jurisdiction of the government of St. Domingo. A free trade with that colony had been allowed, and the revocation of that license is made known to the government of the United States. To its revocation the ordinary rights of sovereignty alone were sufficient. The notification, however, refers to the order of the commander in chief of the French Republic in St. Domingo; and that order would of course be examined as exhibiting more perfectly the extent and the nature of the rights which the French Republic purposed to exercise.</p>
<p>The particular order which preceded this notification is in these words: "Every vessel, French or foreign, which shal be found by the vessels of the Republic riding at anchor in the ports of the island not designated by these presents, or within the bays, creeks, and landing places on the coast, or under sail at a less distance <span class="star-pagination">*274</span> than two leagues from the coast, and communicating with the land, shall be forfeited."</p>
<p>The next decree is dated the 22d of June, 1802, and the extract which is supposed to regulate this particular subject, is in these words: "Every vessel, French or foreign, which shall be found by the vessels of the Republic anchored in one of the ports of the island, not designated by the present decree, or in the bays, coves, or landings of the coast, or under sail at a less distance than two leagues from the coast, and communicating with the land, shall be arrested and confiscated."</p>
<p>Nothing can be more obvious than that these are strictly territorial regulations, proceeding from the sovereign power of St. Domingo, and intended to enforce sovereign rights. Seizure for a breach of this law is to be made only within those limits over which the sovereign claimed a right to legislate, in virtue of that exclusive dominion which every nation possesses within its own territory, and within such a distance from the land as may be considered as a part of its territory. This power is the same in peace and in war, and is exercised according to the discretion of the sovereign. The prohibition and the penalty are the same on French and foreign vessels.</p>
<p>This subject was again taken up in October, 1802, in an arrete, which in part regulates the coasting trade of the island. The 4th, 5th and 6th articles of this decree respect foreign as well as French vessels, and subject them to confiscation in the cases which are there enumerated.</p>
<p>These are all of the same description with those stated in the arrete of the 22d of June; and no seizure is authorised but of vessels found within two leagues of the coast.</p>
<p>The last decree is that which was issued by General Ferrand on the 1st of March, 1804. This deserves the more attention, because it is that on which the courts profess to found their sentence of condemnation, in the particular case under consideration, and because General <span class="star-pagination">*275</span> Ferrand uses expressions which clearly indicate the point of view in which all these arretes were contemplated by the government of the island.</p>
<p>The title of this arrete is, "An arrete relative to vessels taken in contravention of the dispositions of the laws and regulations concerning French and foreign commerce in the colony."</p>
<p>In stating the motives for this ordinance, it is said, "That some French agents in the neighbouring and allied islands had mistaken the application of the laws and regulations concerning vessels taken in contravention, upon the coasts of St. Domingo occupied by the rebels, and had confounded those prizes with those which were made upon the enemy of the state." "Desiring to put an end to all the abuses which might result from this mistake, and which would be as injurious to the territorial sovereignty as to the rights of neutrality," the commander in chief, after some further recitals, which are not deemed material, ordains the law under which the tribunals have proceeded.</p>
<p>The distinction, between seizures made in right of war, and those which are made for infractions of the commercial regulations established by the sovereign power of the state, is here taken in terms; and that legislation, which was directed against vessels contravening the laws and regulations concerning French and foreign commerce in the colony, is clearly of the latter description.</p>
<p>The first article of this ordonnance is recited in the sentence, as that on which the condemnation is founded. It is in these words:</p>
<p>"The port of Santo Domingo is the only one in the colony of St. Domingo that is open to the French and foreign commerce; in consequence, all vessels anchored in the bays, harbours, and landing places, on the coast occupied by the rebels, those cleared for the ports in their possession coming out with or without a cargo, and, generally, all vessels sailing in the territorial extent of the island, (except that from Cape Raphael to <span class="star-pagination">*276</span> Ocoa bay,) found at a distance less than two leagues from the coast, shall be detained by the state vessels and privateers having our letters of marque, who shall conduct them, if possible, into the port of Santo Domingo, that the confiscation of the said vessels and cargoes may be pronounced."</p>
<p>As this article authorises a seizure of those vessels only which are "sailing within the territorial extent of the island, found within less than two leagues of the coast," it is deemed by the court to be sufficiently evident that the seizure and confiscation are made in consequence of a violation of municipal regulation, and not in right of war. It is true that the revolt of the colony is the motive for this exercise of sovereign power. Still it is an exercise of sovereign power, restricting itself within those limits which are the province of municipal law, not the exercise of a belligerent right.</p>
<p>The tribunal professing to carry this law into execution, though capable of sitting either as a prize or an instance court, must be considered in this case as acting in the character of an instance court, since it is in that character that it punishes violations of municipal law.</p>
<p>The Sarah was captured more than ten leagues from the coast of St. Domingo, was never carried within the jurisdiction of the tribunal of that colony, was sold at Barracoa, in the island of Cuba, and afterwards condemned as prize under the arrete of General Ferrand, which has been stated.</p>
<p>If the court of St. Domingo had jurisdiction of the case, its sentence is conclusive. If it had no jurisdiction, the proceedings are coram non judice, and must be disregarded.</p>
<p>Of its own jurisdiction, so far as depends on municipal rules, the court of a foreign nation must judge, and its decision must be respected. But if it exercises a jurisdiction which, according to the law of nations, its sovereign could not confer, however available its sentences may be within the dominions of the prince from whom the authority is derived, they are not regarded <span class="star-pagination">*277</span> by foreign courts. This distinction is taken upon this principle, that the law of nations is the law of all tribunals in the society of nations, and is supposed to be equally understood by all.</p>
<p>Thus the sentence of a court sitting in a neutral territory, and instituted by a belligerent; has been declared not to change the property it professed to condemn; and thus the question whether a prize court sitting in the country of the captor could condemn property lying in a neutral port, has been fully examined, and although the jurisdiction of the court in such case was admitted, yet no doubt appears to have been entertained of the propriety of examining the question, and deciding it according to the practice of nations.</p>
<p>Since courts, who are required to decide whether the condemnation of a vessel and cargo by a foreign tribunal has effected a change of property, may inquire whether the sentence was pronounced by a court which, according to the principles of national law, could have jurisdiction over the subject; this court must inquire whether, in conformity with that law, the tribunal sitting at St. Domingo to punish violations of the municipal laws enacted by its sovereign, could take jurisdiction of a vessel seized on the high seas, for infracting those laws, and carried into a foreign port.</p>
<p>In prosecuting this inquiry, the first question which presents itself to the mind is, what act gives an inchoate jurisdiction to a court?</p>
<p>It cannot be the offence itself. It is repugnant to every idea of a proceeding in rem, to act against a thing which is not in the power of the sovereign under whose authority the court proceeds; and no nation will admit that its property should be absolutely changed, while remaining in its own possession, by a sentence which is entirely ex parte. Those on board a vessel are supposed to represent all who are interested in it, and if placed in a situation which requires them to take notice of any proceedings against a vessel and cargo, and enables them to assert the rights of the interested, the cause is considered as being properly heard, and all concerned <span class="star-pagination">*278</span> are parties to it. But the owners of vessels navigating the high seas or lying in port, cannot take notice of any proceedings which may be instituted against those vessels in foreign countries; and consequently, such proceedings would be entirely ex parte, and a sentence founded on them never would be, and never ought to be, regarded.</p>
<p>The offence then alleged to have been committed by The Sarah, could not be cognizable by the court of St. Domingo, until some other act was performed which should make the owners of the vessel and cargo parties to the proceedings instituted against them, and should place them within the legitimate power of the sovereign, for the infraction of whose laws they were to be confiscated. There must then be a seizure, in order to vest the possession of the thing in the offended sovereign, and enable his courts to proceed against it. This seizure, if made either by a civil officer, or a cruiser acting under the authority of the sovereign, vests the possession in him, and enables him to inquire, by his tribunals constituted for the purpose, into the allegations made against, and in favour of the offending vessel. Those interested in the property which has been seized are considered as parties to this inquiry, and all nations admit that the sentence, whether correct or otherwise, is conclusive.</p>
<p>Will a seizure de facto, made without the territorial dominion of the sovereign under cover of whose authority it is made, give a court jurisdiction of a thing never brought within the dominions of that sovereign?</p>
<p>This is a question upon which considerable difficulty has been felt, and on which some contrariety of opinion exists. It has been doubted whether proceedings, denominated judicial, are, in such a case, merely irregular, or are to be considered as absolutely void, being coram non judice. If merely irregular, the courts of the country pronouncing the sentence were the exclusive judges of that irregularity, and their decision binds the world; if coram non judice, the sentence is as if not pronounced.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*279</span> It is conceded that the legislation of every country is territorial; that beyond its own territory, it can only affect its own subjects or citizens. It is not easy to conceive a power to execute a municipal law, or to enforce obedience to that law without the circle in which that law operates. A power to seize for the infraction of a law is derived from the sovereign, and must be exercised, it would seem, within those limits which circumscribe the sovereign power. The rights of war may be exercised on the high seas, because war is carried on upon the high seas; but the pacific rights of sovereignty must be exercised within the territory of the sovereign.</p>
<p>If these propositions be true, a seizure of a person not a subject, or of a vessel not belonging to a subject, made on the high seas, for the breach of a municipal regulation, is an act which the sovereign cannot authorise. The person who makes this seizure, then, makes it on a pretext which, if true, will not justify the act, and is a marine trespasser. To a majority of the court it seems to follow, that such a seizure is totally invalid; that the possession, acquired by this unlawful act, is his own possession, not that of the sovereign; and that such possession confers no jurisdiction on the court of the country to which the captor belongs.</p>
<p>This having been the fact in the case of The Sarah, and neither the vessel, nor the captain, supercargo, nor crew, having ever been brought within the jurisdiction of the court, or within the dominion of the sovereign whose laws were infracted, the jurisdiction of the court over the subject of its sentence never attached, the proceedings were entirely ex parte, and the sentence is not to be regarded.</p>
<p>The case of The Helena, already cited, may at first view be thought a case which would give validity to any seizure wherever made, and would refer the legality of that seizure solely to the sovereign of the captor. But on a deliberate consideration of that case, the majority of the court is of opinion that this inference is not warranted by it. Several circumstances concurred in producing <span class="star-pagination">*280</span> the decision which was made, and those circumstances vary that case materially from this. The captured vessel was carried into port, and while in the power of the sovereign was transferred by his particular authority in solemn form.</p>
<p>In such a case, Sir W. Scott conceived that a sentence of confiscation conformably with the laws of Algiers, was to be presumed. But his decision did not turn singly on this point. The vessel, after passing in this formal manner to a Spanish purchaser, had, with equal solemnity, been again transferred to a British purchaser; and the judge considered this second purchaser, with how much reason may perhaps be doubted, as in a better situation than the original purchaser. This case is badly reported, the points made by counsel on one side are totally omitted, and the opinion of the judge is not given with that clearness which usually characterizes the opinions of Sir William Scott. But the seizure was presumed to be made by way of reprisals for some breach of the treaty between the two powers, so that the possession of the captor was considered as legitimately the possession of his sovereign, and from the subsequent conduct of the Dey himself, a condemnation according to the usages of Algiers was presumed.</p>
<p>But in presuming a condemnation, this case does not, it is thought, dispense with the necessity of one; nor is it supposed, in presuming a legitimate cause of seizure, to declare that a seizure made without authority, by a commissioned cruiser, would vest the possession in the sovereign of the captor, and give jurisdiction to his courts.</p>
<p>If this case is to be considered as if no sentence of condemnation was ever pronounced, the property is not changed, and this court, having no right to enforce the penal laws of a foreign country, cannot inquire into any infraction of those laws. The property in this particular case was purchased under circumstances which exclude any doubt respecting its identity, and respecting the full knowledge of the purchaser of the nature of the title he acquired.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*281</span> The sentence of condemnation being considered as null and invalid, the property is unchanged, and therefore ought to be recovered by the libellants in the court below. But those libellants ought to account with the defendants for the freight, insurance, and duties on importation, and for such other expenses as would have been properly chargeable on themselves as importers; and each party is to bear his own costs.</p>
<p>The sentence of the circuit court is to be reversed, and also the sentence of the district court, so far as it contravenes this opinion, and the cause is to be remanded to the circuit court for the district of South Carolina, for a final decision thereon.</p>
<p>LIVINGSTON, J.</p>
<p>Without expressing an opinion on the invalidity of a seizure on the high seas under a municipal regulation, if the property be immediately carried into a port of the country to which the capturing vessel belongs, and there regularly proceeded against, I concur in the judgment just delivered, because The Sarah and her cargo were condemned by a French tribunal sitting at St. Domingo, without having been carried into that, or any other French port, and while lying in the port of Charleston, South Carolina, whither they had been carried, by and with the consent of the captor.</p>
<p>CUSHING and CHASE, Justices, concurred in opinion with Judge Livingston.</p>
<p>JOHNSON, J.</p>
<p>This cause comes up on appeal from the circuit court of South Carolina, acting in the capacity of an instance court of admiralty. The doctrines which regulated the decision of the circuit court, are not overruled by a majority of the bench; but the decree of that court is rescinded, because to three of the five judges who concur in sustaining the appeal, it appears that the property could not be condemned in the court of St. Domingo, while lying in a neutral port: and to the other two, that the capture on the high seas, for a breach of municipal regulation, was contrary to the law of nations, and therefore vested no jurisdiction in the court of St. Domingo. On the former doctrine it is not <span class="star-pagination">*282</span> necessary to make any observations, because in the case of the Sea-flower, argued together with this as one cause, and decided on the same day, that doctrine is expressly overruled. But on the latter point I think it proper, briefly to state the reasons upon which I found my disapprobation, both of the doctrine and of its application to this case.</p>
<p>It would have been some relief to us in determining this question, had it been made a point by counsel, either in their argument in this court, or in the court below; but it appears to have been wholly unnoticed by them.</p>
<p>Most of the difficulties which have occurred in the investigation of this case, appear to have resulted from an indistinct view of the nature, origin, and object of prize courts. Conducted by the same forms, and very generally blended in the same persons, it is not easy to trace upon the mind, the discriminating line between the instance and prize courts; yet the object of the institution of the latter court, when considered, strongly marks the distinguishing point between them. In its ordinary jurisdiction, the admiralty takes cognizance of mere questions of meum and tuum arising between individuals; its extraordinary or prize jurisdiction is vested in it for the purpose of revising the acts of the sovereign himself performed through the agency of his officers or subjects. A seizure on the high seas by an unauthorised individual, is a mere trespass, and produces no change of right, but such a seizure made by sovereign authority, vests the thing seized in the sovereign; for the fact of possession must have all the beneficial effects of the right of possession, as the justice or propriety of it cannot be inquired into by the courts of other nations. But as this principle might leave the unoffending individual a prey to the rapacity of cruisers, or a victim to the errors of those who even mean well, and as every civilized nation pretends to the character of justice and moderation, and to have an interest in preserving the peace of the world, they constitute courts with powers to inquire into the correctness of captures made under colour of their own authority, and to give redress to those who have been unmeritedly attacked or injured. These are denominated prize courts, and the primary <span class="star-pagination">*283</span> object of their institution, is to inquire whether a taking as prize, is sanctioned by the authority of their sovereign, or the unauthorised act of an individual. From this it would seem to follow, that the decision of such a court, is the only legal organ of communication, through which the sanction of a sovereign can be ascertained, and that no other court is at liberty to deny the existence of sovereign authority, for a seizure which a prize court has declared to be the act of its sovereign.</p>
<p>The propriety of such an act may correctly become the subject of executive or diplomatic discussion; but the equality of nations forbids that the conduct of one sovereign, or the correctness of the principles upon which he acts, should be submitted to the jurisdiction of the courts of another. From these considerations I infer, that the capture and continued possession of The Sarah and her cargo, confirmed by the approbatory sentence of a court of the capturing power, vested a title in the claimant, which this court cannot, consistently with the law of nations, interpose its authority to defeat.</p>
<p>Having briefly stated the grounds upon which I originally formed, and now adhere to an opinion in favour of the claimants, I will consider the objections stated to the jurisdiction of the court, on the ground that the seizure was contrary to the law of nations.</p>
<p>It is admitted, if the court of St. Domingo had jurisdiction of the subject matter, that the condemnation completed the divestiture of property. But it is contended that the subject, in this case, was not within their jurisdiction, because it was seized for a cause not sanctioned by the law of nations. I am unfortunate enough to think that neither the premises nor the conclusion of this argument, are maintainable. The conclusion is subject to this very obvious objection, that it defeats the very end for which such courts were created.</p>
<p>To contend that a violation of the law of nations will take away the jurisdiction of a court, which sits and judges according to the law of nations, appears to approach very near to a solecism. The occurrence which gives it jurisdiction, takes it away.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*284</span> If the object and end of constituting a prize court be to give redress against unlawful capture, and, as the books say, in such case to restore velis levatis, how can it make reparation to the injured individual if it loses its jurisdiction; because there has been an injury done to him, the court can give him no redress. The argument admits, that a capture consistent with the law of nations, would give jurisdiction, but how is the legality or illegality of a capture to be determined, unless a court can take jurisdiction of the case. The legality of the capture is the very point to which a court is to direct its inquiries, and yet that inquiry is arrested in its inception. The cause or circumstances of a capture can never be known to a court, without exercising jurisdiction on the subject. To maintain therefore, that prize courts can only exercise jurisdiction over captures, made consistently with the law of nations is, in effect, to deprive them of all jurisdiction, since it leaves no means of deciding the question on which their jurisdiction rests.</p>
<p>But the premises which lead to this conclusion, will be found no less exceptionable than the conclusion itself; and the propriety of taking into consideration the questions which form those premises very questionable. The opinion of those of my brethren who maintain this doctrine, is founded upon two propositions.</p>
<p>1. That a nation cannot capture, on the high seas, a vessel which has within her territories, committed a breach of a municipal law.</p>
<p>2. That the condemnation in this case, was grounded on an offence against a municipal law.</p>
<p>To me it appears wholly immaterial on what grounds the decision be founded, if the case be within their jurisdiction. Indeed, this is fully admitted by those of the court, who maintain the doctrine that I am considering; but under the idea of examining the jurisdiction of the court, they appear to me to go farther and examine into the correctness of its decision. I do not deny that there are circumstances material to the effect of sentenecs of foreign prize courts, into which other courts may <span class="star-pagination">*285</span> inquire. The authorities quoted on this point relate exclusively to two, viz.</p>
<p>1. Whether the court is held in the territory of the sovereign who constitutes it.</p>
<p>2. Whether the subject was sub potestate of the sovereign whose courts condemned it.</p>
<p>These circumstances have an immediate relation to the existence of the court, and of its power of acting upon the subject; but within its legitimate scope of action, the correctness of its proceedings, or of the rules of decision by which it is governed, cannot, in the nature of things, and consistently with the idea of perfect equality and independence, be subjected to the review of other courts.</p>
<p>The decisions of such courts do not derive their effect from their abstract justice; they are in this respect analogous to the acts of sovereignty. They are universally conclusive, because no where subject to revision. Among nations they are considered as entitled to the same validity as the decisions of municipal courts, within their respective territories, and preclude the rights of parties, although contrary to every idea of law, reason and evidence.</p>
<p>The court of St. Domingo being a court of co-ordinate authority with this, was equally competent to decide a question of jurisdiction arising under the law of nations. Had the question whether a seizure under municipal law, upon the high seas, was contrary to the law of nations Â— or, if contrary to the law of nations, whether the court could not therefore exercise jurisdiction upon it, been brought to the notice of that court, it is presumed that their decree would not have been void, because they maintained the negative of the proposition. Had it been made a question before that court, whether the laws of France authorised the capture of The Sarah at ten leagues distance from the coast, or whether in fact the vessel was not seized within two leagues of the coast, it is presumed that their decision upon these points would have been conclusive, whatever may be the impression <span class="star-pagination">*286</span> of this court from the evidence now before us. It is impossible for this court to pretend to a knowledge of all the facts by which the decree of that court may have been regulated. The decree itself shows that the whole evidence is not before us; but if it were, that court is sole arbiter, both of the effect of testimony, and the credibility of witnesses. A similar observation may be made with regard to the laws of France, which much pains has been taken to prove, did not authorise this capture. How can this court be supposed to know all the laws, sovereign orders, or received principles which regulate the decisions of foreign courts. Such courts are best acquainted with the laws of their own government, and their decision upon the existence or effect of those laws must, in the nature of things, be conclusive in the eyes of other nations. Suppose that other courts were so far at liberty as to review the grounds upon which such decrees profess to proceed, the insufficiency of those grounds would not be conclusive against the correctness of such decisions, because they may be maintainable upon other grounds, not noticed, or even not known to the judge who pronounces them.</p>
<p>But if we are to look into the grounds upon which a decree is professedly founded, extravagant as that upon the case of The Sarah is said to be, there is one view in which it may admit of justification. General Ferrand in his preamble declares it to be his leading object to remove the contrariety of opinion which existed among the officers of government relative to existing laws, respecting captures of vessels taken upon the coasts of St. Domingo. If their judges thought proper to consider this arrete as only declaratory of pre-existing laws, and that the words in the first article, "ceux expediÃ© "pour les portes en leur possession en sortant avec ou "sans chargement," authorised the capture of vessels outward bound, I know no reason that we can have to declare it a misconstruction or incorrect opinion, or, if incorrect, to nullify their decree on that account. The conclusiveness of a foreign sentence appears to be at an end, the moment other courts undertake to look into the cause for which a capture was made. If the possession of the captor is the possession of his sovereign, and his courts have a right therefore to adjudicate property captured, <span class="star-pagination">*287</span> or carried into a foreign port, it appears to me to be immaterial on what ground the capture is made. The fact of dispossession by sovereign authority, judicially ascertained, deprives all other courts of the right to act upon the case.</p>
<p>Upon these considerations I have adopted the opinion that we are not at liberty to enter into the inquiry, whether the capture of The Sarah was made in pursuance of belligerent or municipal rights. But if we are to enter into the inquiry, I am of opinion that the evidence before us plainly makes out a case of belligerent capture, and, though not so, that the capture may be justified, although for the breach of a municipal law.</p>
<p>In support of my latter position, both principle, and the practice of Great Britain and our own government may be appealed to.</p>
<p>The ocean is the common jurisdiction of all sovereign powers; from which it does not result that their powers upon the ocean exist in a state of suspension or equipoise, but that every power is at liberty upon the ocean to exercise its sovereign right, provided it, does no act inconsistent with that general equality of nations which exists upon the ocean. The seizure of a ship upon the high seas, after she has committed an act of forfeiture within a territory, is not inconsistent with the sovereign rights of the nation to which she belongs, because it is the law of reason, and the general understanding of nations, that the offending individual forfeits his claim to protection, and every nation is the legal avenger of its own wrongs. Within their jurisdictional limits the rights of sovereignty are exclusive; upon the ocean they are concurrent. Whatever the great principle of self defence in its reasonable and necessary exercise will sanction in an individual in a state of nature, nations may lawfully perform upon the ocean. This principle, as well as most others, may be carried to an unreasonable extent; it may be made the pretence instead of the real ground of aggression, and then it will become a just cause of war. I contend only for its reasonable exercise. The act of Great Britain, of the 24 Geo. III. c. 47. is predicated upon these principles. It subjects vessels to <span class="star-pagination">*288</span> seizure, which approach with certain cargoes on board, within the distance of four leagues of her coast, because it would be difficult, it not impossible to execute her trade laws, if they were suffered to approach nearer in the prosecution of an illicit design. But it they have been within that distance, they are afterwards subject to be seized on the high seas. They have then violated her laws and have forfeited the protection of their sovereign. The laws of the United States upon the subject of trade, appear to have been framed in some measure after the model of the English statutes; and the 29th section of the act of 1799, expressly authorises the seizure of a vessel that has, within the jurisdiction of the United States, committed an act of forfeiture, wherever she may be met with by a revenue cutter, without limiting the distance from the coast. So also the act of 1806, for prohibiting the importation of slaves, authorises a seizure beyond our jurisdictional limits, if the vessel be found with slaves on board, hovering on the coast; a latitude of expression that can only be limited by circumstances, and the discretion of a court, and in case of fresh pursuit, would be actually without limitation. Indeed, after passing the jurisdictional limits of a state, a vessel is as much on the high seas as if in the middle of the ocean; and if France could authorise a seizure at the distance of two leagues, she could at the distance of twenty.</p>
<p>But the capture of The Sarah may fairly be considered as an exercise of belligerent right, and strictly analogous to seizure for breach of blockade. The right of one nation to exclude all others from trading with her territories, exists equally in war and in peace. Had the exclusion in this case been merely calculated for the interests of trade, it may have been considered as purely municipal. But there existed a war between the parent state and her colony. It was not only a fact of the most universal notoriety, but officially notified in the gazettes of the United States, by the proclamation of the French resident M. Pichon, who at the same time publishes the prohibition to trade with the revolters, with a declaration that seizure and confiscation should be the consequence of disobedience to this prohibition. Here then was notice of the existence of war, and an assertion <span class="star-pagination">*289</span> of the rights consequent upon it. The object of the measure was not the promotion of any particular branch of agriculture, manufacture, or commerce, but solely the reduction of an enemy. It was therefore not merely municipal, but belligerent in its nature and object. If France had a right to subdue the revolted colony, she had an undoubted right to preclude all nations from supplying them with the means of protracting the war. To confine her to her own jurisdictional limits, in the exercise of those acts of force which were necessary to carry into effect her right of excluding neutrals, would be a mere mockery, when by the very state of things she was herself shut out from those limits. Seizure on the high seas for a breach of the right of blockade, during the whole return voyage, is universally acquiesced in as a reasonable exercise of sovereign power. The principle of blockade has indeed in modern times been pushed to such an extravagant extent as to become a very justifiable cause of war, but still it is admitted to be consistent with the law of nations, when confined within the limits of reason and necessity. The right to subdue an enemy, carries with it the right to make use of the necessary means for that purpose, and the individual who does an act inconsistent with the rights of a belligerent, exposes himself to the liability to be treated as an enemy. The belligerent nation can exercise the same acts of violence against him that she can against an individual of her enemy. Nor can his sovereign protect an individual who has committed an aggression upon belligerent rights without becoming a party to the contest.</p>
<p>The argument drawn from the decree of Ferrand, to prove that France had not asserted her belligerent rights, is evidently founded upon a mistranslation. The sentence which authorises the seizure of vessels when outward bound, after having entered the ports of St. Domingo, is substantive, and totally unaffected by the subsequent sentence, which authorises a seizure of vessels sailing within two leagues of the coast. The former authorises capture for the offence of having entered those ports; the latter, for being found in a situation from which an intention to commit that offence shall be inferred. Nor, if the fact were so, that she had limited the right of capture to two leagues from her coast, would <span class="star-pagination">*290</span> it follow that this was an exercise of municipal right; because a nation may restrict her subjects, in the exercise of belligerent rights, to a certain distance from the coast, or even to her jurisdictional limits, and yet the character of the seizure would be in no wise changed. If the object of the seizure is to promote the reduction of an enemy, it is an exercise of the rights of war.</p>
<p>From these considerations I conclude that the capture of The Sarah was justifiable upon principles not at all dependent upon municipal regulation; that it may fairly be considered as having been made in conformity with the law of nations, and, therefore, without acceding to the doctrine that a seizure contrary to the law of nations was a void seizure, and that we have a right to declare that a mere marine trespass which a court of France has declared to be the act of its sovereign, I conclude that the court of St. Domingo had jurisdiction in this case; and if it had jurisdiction, it is admitted that the property was altered, and the libellant ought not to recover.</p>
<p>Let it be observed that this is not an application on behalf of the vendee of the captor for the aid of this court to secure to him the benefit of his purchase. We find him in possession, and the application is for our aid to divest that possession, and restore it to the original owner. This owner was clearly an offender against the rights of France, and his only claim upon the interference of this court is, that he had escaped, with the property thus acquired, beyond two leagues from the shore of the nation that he had offended. In such a case it would be enough for all the purposes of the defendant, if this court would imitate the state of our nation, and remain neutral between the parties.</p>
<p>Let it not be supposed that the opinion which I am giving devotes the commerce of our country to lawless depredation. My observations are applied to a case in which an evident aggression has been committed, by entering at least two of the interdicted ports of St. Domingo. The individual who will knowingly violate the rights of war, or laws of trade of another nation, is well apprised that he forfeits all claim to the protection of his country, or the interference of its courts. The peace of <span class="star-pagination">*291</span> the nation, and the interests of the fair trader, imperiously require that the smuggler, or the violator of neutrality, should be left to his fate.</p>
<p>If I had no other reason to satisfy my mind of the correctness of the doctrines that I have been contending for, a conviction of their importance to the peace and security of the mercantile world would alone induce me to maintain them. The purchase of these goods was made in a Spanish port, under sanction of an agent of the French government, apparently countenanced by the government of the country in which he acted, and is sanctioned by a condemnation. If in the purchase of articles of merchandize in a foreign port, under the sanction of sovereign authority, it is nevertheless necessary, in order to acquire a good property, that a merchant should know whether they were captured by law or without law, under the law of nations, or under municipal law, the office of a lawyer will be as necessary to his education as the counting house. Articles of commerce passing from hand to hand by mere delivery, often remaining for years in the same packages, distinguished by the same marks, may admit of identification after any length of time, in the remotest countries, and in the hands of the most innocent purchasers. But if a seizure by a sovereign, upon a ground which any court may adjudge unsanctioned by the law of nations, is tantamount to no seizure, and nothing done in pursuance of it can transfer a good property, where is the uncertainty to end? With regard to ships the inconvenience may not be so great. Every merchant knows that a vessel must be accompanied with her document papers, so that the purchaser may come to the knowledge of her having passed through a capture and condemnation, and be put on his guard against so precarious a title. He will know that he is liable to be dispossessed according to the varying constructions of the law of nations that may prevail in different countries; yet he knows the full value of a property thus embarrassed. But in the purchase of merchandize he has no security, unless indeed he purchases them immediately from the manufacturer or the planter. It is a subject of curious speculation how far the pursuit or research after merchandize thus situated may be carried; whether the same principle may not extend it into the <span class="star-pagination">*292</span> hands of the retailer or even the consumer. In one of the cases arising out of the capture of The Sarah, I mean that against Groning, the property is libelled in the hands of a purchaser without notice, after it was landed in this country. If we can go so far, I see not where we are to stop. Every subsequent purchaser, even the remotest, as far as the article will admit of identification, is in no better situation than the defendant Groning, and liable, upon the same principle, to be dispossessed. After going beyond the fact of seizure by sovereign authority within his own territory, (where he is supreme,) or upon the ocean, (where he is equal to all others,) unaffected by escape, recapture or release, (by which property is restored to its state before seizure,) the approbatory sentence of his own court Â— (by which alone it can be judicially known to be the act of the sovereign) Â— beyond these limits every step that a court takes can only be productive of doubt, litigation and uncertainty, and involve the commercial world in endless embarrassment, at the same time that it compromits the peace of nations, among whom it is a received and correct opinion, that a want of due deference to the jurisdiction of their maritime courts is a just cause of war.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>Sentence of the Court, March 2, 1808.</h2>
<p>This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record, and on sundry exhibits introduced into the case in this court, and was argued by counsel, on consideration whereof, it appearing that The Sarah with her cargo were seized without the territorial jurisdiction claimed by the French government of St. Domingo, for the breach of a municipal regulation, and having never been carried within that jurisdiction, were sold by the captor in a foreign port, and afterwards condemned by the court of St. Domingo, as having violated the laws for regulating the commerce of French and foreign vessels with that colony, which laws authorise a seizure of vessels found within two leagues of the coast; it is the opinion of the court, that the seizure of The Sarah and her cargo is to be considered as a marine trespass, not vesting the possession in the sovereign of the captor, or <span class="star-pagination">*293</span> giving jurisdiction to the court which passed the sentence of condemnation, and, therefore, that the said sentence did not change the property in The Sarah and her cargo, which ought to be restored to the plaintiffs, the original owners, subject to those charges of freight, insurance and other expenses which would have been incurred by the owners in bringing the cargo into the United States, which equitable deductions the defendants are at liberty to show in the circuit court. This court is therefore of opinion, that the sentence of the circuit court of South Carolina ought to be reversed, and the cause be remanded to that court, in order that a final decree may be made therein, conformably to this opinion.</p>
<h2>NOTES</h2>
<p>[*]  This case was argued in connexion with the case of Rose v. Groening, which was a libel for another part of the cargo of the Sarah; and with the case of La Font v. Bigelow, from Maryland, which was an action of replevin by the original owner of goods condemned by the tribunal at Santo Domingo, under similar circumstances; and with the case of Hudson and Smith v. Guestier, also from Maryland, which was trover for the cargo of the Sea Flower, condemned upon similar grounds; and with the case of Pulmer and Higgins v. Dutilgb, from Pennsylvania, which was replevin for the cargo of the brig Ceres, condemned under similar circumstances; and with the case of Pluyment v. The Brig Ceres, which was a libel in the district court of the United States a Philadelphia, for restoration of the vessel. These cases were all supposed to depend on the same questions, and by consent of counsel, with leave of the court, were argued as one cause. This accounts for the great number of the counsel employed, and for the great length of the argument, which consumed nine days.
</p>
<p>Upon the opening of these cases, six judges being present, it appeared that three of the six judges had given opinions in the circuit court upon the principal points which were about to be argued, and that if each judge who had given an opinion, should withdraw from the bench, as had been customary heretofore, there would not remain a quorum to try the cause. It was thereupon agreed by all the judges that they would sit. Chase, Johnson, and Livingston, Justices, expressed themselves strongly against the practice of a judge's leaving the bench because he had decided the case in the court below. Washington, Justice, said he should not insist upon the practice, if it should be generally abandoned by the judges The whole six judges (Todd, Justice, being absent) sat in the cause; so that the practice of retiring seems to be abandoned.</p>

THE NEWPORT INSURANCE COMPANY.</h1></center>
<center><p><b>Supreme Court of United States.</b></p></center>
<center></center>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*186</span> It was now argued by Dallas and C. Lee for the plaintiff in error, and by Rawle for the defendants.</p>
<p>Argument for the plaintiff in error.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*197</span> MARSHALL, Ch. J. (all the seven judges being present) delivered the opinion of the court as follows: viz.</p>
<p>This suit is instituted to recover from the underwriters the amount of a policy insuring the brig John, on a voyage from Charleston to Cadiz. The vessel was captured on her passage by a British squadron then blockading that port, was sent into Gibraltar for adjudication, and was there condemned by the court of vice-admiralty as lawful prize. The assured warrants the ship to be American property; and the defence is, that this warranty is conclusively falsified by the sentence of condemnation.</p>
<p>The points made for the consideration of the court are,</p>
<p>1st. Is the sentence of a foreign court of admiralty conclusive evidence, in an action against the underwriters, of the facts it professes to decide? If so.</p>
<p>2d. Does this sentence, upon its face, falsify the warranty contained in the policy? If not,</p>
<p>3d. Does the special verdict exhibit facts which falsify the warranty?</p>
<p>The question on the conclusiveness of a sentence of a foreign court of admiralty having been more than once elaborately argued, the court reluctantly avoids a decision of it at present. But there are particular reasons which restrain one of the judges from giving an opinion on that point, and another case has been mentioned, in which it is said to constitute the sole question. In that case, it will of course be determined.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*198</span> Passing over the consideration of the first point, therefore, the court proceeded to inquire whether this cause could be decided on the second and third points.</p>
<p>Admitting for the present that the sentence of a foreign court of admiralty is conclusive, with respect to what it professes to decide, does this sentence falsify the warranty contained in this policy, that the brig John is American property?</p>
<p>The sentence declares "the said brig to have been cleared out for Cadiz, a port actually blockaded by the arms of our sovereign lord the king, and that the master of said brig persisted in his intention of entering that port, after warning from the blockading force not to do so, in a direct breach and violation of the blockade thereby notified."</p>
<p>The sentence, then, does not deny the brig to have been American property. But it is contended by the counsel for the underwriters, that a ship warranted to be American is impliedly warranted to conduct herself during the voyage as an American, and that an attempt to enter a blockaded port, knowing it to be blockaded, forfeits that character.</p>
<p>This position cannot be controverted.</p>
<p>It remains, then, to inquire, whether the sentence proves the brig John to have violated the laws of blockade; that is, whether the cause of condemnation is alleged in such terms as to show that the vessel had forfeited her neutral character, or in such terms as to show its insufficiency to support the sentence.</p>
<p>The fact of clearing out for a blockaded port, is in itself innocent, unless it be accompanied with knowledge of the blockade. The clearance, therefore, is not considered as the offence; the persisting in the intention to enter that port, after warning by the blockading force, is the ground of the sentence.</p>
<p>Is this intention (evidenced by no fact whatever) a breach of blockade? This question is to be decided by <span class="star-pagination">*199</span> a reference to the law of nations, and to the treaty between the United States and Great Britain.</p>
<p>Vattel, b. 3. s. 177. says, "All commerce is entirely prohibited with a besieged town. If I lay siege to a place, or only from the blockade, I have a right to hinder any one from entering, and to treat as an enemy whoever attempts to enter the place, or carry any thing to the besieged, without my leave."</p>
<p>The right to treat the vessel as an enemy is declared, by Vattel, to be founded on the attempt to enter, and certainly this attempt must be made by a person knowing the fact.</p>
<p>But this subject has been precisely regulated by the treaty between the United States and Great Britain, which was in force when this condemnation took place. That treaty contains the following clause:</p>
<p>"And whereas it frequently happens that vessels sail for a port or place belonging to an enemy, without knowing that the same is either besieged, blockaded or invested; it is agreed that every vessel so circumstanced may be turned away from such port or place, but she shall not be detained, nor her cargo, if not contraband, be confiscated, unless after notice she shall again attempt to enter; but she shall be permitted to go to any other port or place she may think proper."</p>
<p>This treaty is conceived to be a correct exposition of the law of nations; certainly it is admitted by the parties to it, as between themselves, to be a correct exposition of that law, or to constitute a rule in the place of it.</p>
<p>Neither the law of nations nor the treaty admits of the condemnation of the neutral vessel for the intention to enter a blockaded port, unconnected with any fact. Sailing for a blockaded port, knowing it to be blockaded, has been in some English cases construed into an attempt to enter that port, and has therefore been adjudged a breach of the blockade from the departure of the vessel. <span class="star-pagination">*200</span> Without giving any opinion on that point, it may be observed, that in such cases the fact of sailing is coupled with the intention, and the sentence of condemnation is founded on an actual breach of blockade. The cause assigned for condemnation would be a justifiable cause, and it would be for the foreign court alone to determine whether the testimony supported the allegation that the blockade was broken. Had this sentence averred that the brig John had broken the blockade, or had attempted to enter the port of Cadiz after warning from the blockading force, the cause of condemnation would have been justifiable, and without controverting the conclusiveness of the sentence, the assured could not have entered into any inquiry respecting the conduct of the vessel. But this is not the language of the sentence. An attempt to enter the port of Cadiz is not alleged, but persisting in the intention, after being warned not to enter it, is alleged as the cause of condemnation. This is not a good cause under the treaty. It is impossible to read that instrument without perceiving a clear intention in the parties to it, that after notice of the blockade, an attempt to enter the port must be made, in order to subject the vessel to confiscation. By the language of the treaty it would appear that a second attempt, after receiving notice, must be made, in order to constitute the offence which will justify a confiscation. "It is agreed," says that instrument, "that every vessel so circumstanced" (that is, every vessel sailing for a blockaded port, without knowledge of the blockade) "may be turned away from such port or place, but she shall not be detained, nor her cargo, if not contraband, be confiscated, unless after notice she shall again attempt to enter."</p>
<p>These words strongly import a stipulation that there shall be a free agency on the part of the commander of the vessel, after receiving notice of the blockade, and that there shall be no detention nor condemnation, unless, in the exercise of that free agency, a second attempt to enter the invested place shall be made.</p>
<p>It cannot be necessary to state that testimony which would amount to evidence of such second attempt. Lingering about the place, as if watching for an opportunity <span class="star-pagination">*201</span> to sail into it, or the single circumstance of not making immediately for some other port, or possibly obstinate and determined declarations of a resolution to break the blockade, might be evidence of an attempt, after warning, to enter the blockaded port. But whether these circumstances, or others, may or may not amount to evidence of the offence, the offence itself is attempting again to enter, and "unless, after notice, she shall again attempt to enter," the two nations expressly stipulate "that she shall not be detained, nor her cargo, if not contraband, be confiscated." It would seem as if, aware of the excesses which might be justified, by converting intention into offence, the American negotiator had required the union of fact with intention, to constitute the breach of a blockade.</p>
<p>The cause of condemnation, then, as described in this sentence, is one which, by express compact between the United States and Great Britain, is an insufficient cause, unless the intention was manifested in such manner as, in fair construction, to be equivalent to an attempt to enter Cadiz, after knowledge of the blockade. This not being proved by the sentence itself, the parties are let in to other evidence.</p>
<p>However conclusive, then, the sentence may be, of the particular facts which it alleges, those facts not amounting, in themselves, to a justifiable cause of condemnation, the court must look into the special verdict, which explains what is uncertain in the sentence. The special verdict shows that the vessel was seized on her approaching the port of Cadiz, without previous knowledge of the blockade; that she never was turned away, and "permitted to go to any other port or place;" that she was "detained" for several days, and then sent in for adjudication, without being ever put into the possession of her captain and crew, so as to enable her either "again to attempt to enter" the port of Cadiz, or to sail for some other port; that while thus detained, the commander of the blockading squadron drew the captain of the John into a conversation which must be termed insidious, since its object was to trepan him into expressions which might be construed into evidence of an intention to sail for Cadiz, should he be liberated; <span class="star-pagination">*202</span> that availing himself of some equivocal, unguarded, and perhaps indiscreet answers on the part of the captain, the vessel was sent in for adjudication; and on those expressions was condemned.</p>
<p>This court is of opinion that these facts do not amount to an attempt again to enter the port of Cadiz, and therefore do not amount, under the treaty between the United States and Great Britain, to a breach of the blockade of Cadiz. The sentence of the court of vice-admiralty in Gibraltar, therefore, is not considered as falsifying the warranty that the brig John was American property, or as disabling the assured from recovering against the underwriters in this action, and the testimony in the case shows that the blockade was not broken.</p>
<p>The judgment of the circuit court is to be reversed, with costs, and it is to be certified to that court, that judgment is to be entered on the special verdict for the plaintiff.</p>
<p>Judgment reversed.</p>

<p>The appraisement is not conclusive evidence of the value, but in this case it is the best evidence. It was made by officers of the court under its order, and was regularly returned and filed. It does not impeach the credibility of the witness now examined, for the value is a matter depending upon opinion, and with respect to which the judgments of men may honestly vary. The appraised value would have been the matter in dispute if the property had been delivered up to the claimants upon security given.</p>
<p>Todd, Livingston, Washington, Chase and Cushing, Justices, concurred.</p>
<p>JOHNSON, J. contra. The appraisement was a thing not perfected. It was not acted upon, and might have been impeached.</p>
<p>The appeals were all dismissed for want of jurisdiction in this court.</p>
<p>No objection was made to the viva voce examination of the witness as to the value.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*218</span> On the next day,</p>
<p>Rodney, Attorney General, moved the court for a continuance of these causes, and leave to take affidavits respecting the value of the property, so as to sustain the jurisdiction. This court has only decided that its jurisdiction does not appear upon the record. It is like the case of Course v. Stead's Executors, 4 Dall. 25. where the court continued the cause, and suffered affidavits to be taken to show the value of the matter in dispute. If the court should be of opinion that the decision of yesterday upon the weight of testimony differs this case from that of Course v. Stead, they will reject the motion.</p>
<p>Broom, contra.</p>
<p>If this motion had been made yesterday, before the decision of the court upon the weight of testimony, perhaps it might have been proper, but after the parties have put themselves on trial upon the evidence then before the court, and the decision has been made, it is not usual to open the case and grant a new trial, unless new evidence is suggested to have been discovered since the trial, not known to the party at the time of trial.</p>
<p>MARSHALL, Ch. J. Cannot the United States sue out a new writ of error, and take new affidavits to show the cause to be within our jurisdiction? If so, perhaps the court would not put the United States to that expense.</p>
<p>Rodney apprehended it would be final, it being an appeal, and not a writ of error.</p>

<center><h1>MARSHALL<br/>
v.<br/>
THE DELAWARE INSURANCE COMPANY.</h1></center>
<center><p><b>Supreme Court of United States.</b></p></center>
<center></center>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*203</span> Hopkinson, for plaintiff.</p>
<p>Dallas and Rawle, contra.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*205</span> MARSHALL, Ch. J. after stating the facts of the case as above, delivered the opinion of the court as follows.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*206</span> The question submitted to the consideration of the court is this: Is the assured entitled to recover for a partial or for a total loss?</p>
<p>In support of the claim for a total loss, two points have been made:</p>
<p>1st. That the state of information at the time of the abandonment, not the state of the fact, must decide the right of the assured to abandon.</p>
<p>If this be otherwise, then, it is contended,</p>
<p>2d. That the right to abandon is coextensive with the detention, which continued until restitution was made in fact, and that restitution in fact, though made on the same day, was posterior in point of time to the abandonment.</p>
<p>1. Does the right to abandon depend on the fact, or on the information of the parties?</p>
<p>The right to abandon is founded on an actual or legal total loss. It appears to the court to consist with the nature of the contract, which is truly stated to be a contract of indemnity, that the real state of loss at the time the abandonment is made, is the proper and safe criterion of the rights of the parties. Might they depend absolutely on the state of information, a seizure which scarcely interrupted the voyage might be, and frequently would be converted into a total loss, and the contests respecting the real state of information might be endless. Intelligence of capture and of restitution might be received at the same time, and the insured might suppress the one and act upon the other.</p>
<p>This point came under the consideration of the court in the case of Rhinelander v. The Insurance Company of Pennsylvania, in which case it was said, that "where a belligerent has taken full possession of a vessel as prize, and continues that possession to the time of the abandonment, there exists, in point of law, a total loss." The court, in delivering this opinion, understood itself to require, that the continuance of the possession <span class="star-pagination">*207</span> up to the time of the abandonment, or a technical total loss incurred, notwithstanding the restoration, was necessary to justify a recovery as for a total loss.</p>
<p>In considering the second point, the court proceeded to inquire whether the technical total loss on which the right to abandon depended, was terminated by the decree of restitution, or continued until that decree was carried into execution, and restitution was made in fact.</p>
<p>The real object of the policy is not to effect a change in property, but to indemnify the insured. Whenever, therefore, only a partial loss is sustained by one of the perils insured against, the original owner of the property retains it, prosecutes his voyage, and recovers for his partial loss.</p>
<p>But the voyage may be really broken up, without the destruction of the vessel and cargo. A detention by a foreign prince, either by embargo or capture, may be of such long duration as to defeat the voyage. This is a peril insured against, and of its continuance no certain estimate can be made. In the case of capture it is, for the time, a total loss, and no person can confidently say that the loss will not finally be total. So of an embargo. Its duration cannot be measured, and it may destroy the object of the voyage. These detentions, therefore, are, for the time, total losses, and they furnish reasonable ground for the apprehension that their continuance may be of such duration as to break up the voyage, or ruin the assured, by keeping his property out of his possession. Such a case, therefore, upon the true principles of the contract, has been considered as justifying an abandonment, and a recovery for a total loss.</p>
<p>But when a final decree of restitution, from which it is admitted that no appeal lies, has been awarded, the peril is over. On no reasonable calculation can it be supposed that such a delay of restitution will ensue, as from that time to break up the voyage. There is no reason to presume a subsequent detention on the part of <span class="star-pagination">*208</span> the foreign prince. There is no motive for such detention. The master of the captured vessel may perhaps not be ready to receive possession, and the delay may proceed from him. At any rate, without some evidence that the peril was not actually determined, the court cannot consider it as continuing after the sentence was pronounced. A technical total loss originates in the danger of a real total loss. The court cannot suppose such a danger to have existed after a final sentence of acquittal, unless some order of court relative to a reconsideration could be shown, or it should appear that some other delays were interposed by the court which had pronounced the sentence, or by the sovereign of the captor.</p>
<p>Had the facts on which this question depends been known at New-York and Philadelphia as they occurred, could it have been said that there existed a technical total loss? After a decree of restitution, could it be said that while means were taking to carry that decree into execution, while the mandate for restitution was passing from the court to the vessel, the assured had a right to elect to consider his vessel as lost, and to abandon to the underwriters? To this court, it seems that the right to make such an election at such a time, would be inconsistent with the spirit of the contract, and that the technical total loss was terminated by the decree of restitution, unless something subsequent to that decree could be shown to prove the continuance of the danger, or of an adversary detention.</p>
<p>Nothing in this opinion is intended to extend to the case where a cargo may be lost, without the loss of the vessel.</p>
<p>There is no error in the judgment of the circuit court of Pennsylvania, and it is to be affirmed with costs.</p>
<p>Judgment affirmed.</p>

<center></center>
<p>For the plaintiff in error, it was contended</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*211</span> CUSHING, J. delivered the opinion of the court, as follows.<sup>[Â†]</sup></p>
<p>The court deems it unnecessary to declare an opinion upon a point which was much debated in this cause, whether a real British subject born before the 4th of July, 1776; who never from the time of his birth, resided within any of the American colonies or states, can, upon the principles of the common law, take lands by descent in the United States; because Daniel Coxe, under whom the lessor of the plaintiff claims, was born in the province of New-Jersey, long before the declaration of independence, and resided there until some time in the year 1777, when he joined the British forces.</p>
<p>Neither does this case produce the necessity of discriminating very nicely the precise point of time, when <span class="star-pagination">*212</span> Daniel Coxe lost his right of election to abandon the American cause, and to adhere to his allegiance to the king of Great Britain; because he remained in the state of New-Jersey; not only after she had declared herself a sovereign state, but after she had passed laws by which she pronounced him to be a member of, and in allegiance to the new government. The court entertains no doubt that after the 4th of October, 1776, he became a member of the new society, entitled to the protection of its government, and bound to that government by the ties of allegiance.</p>
<p>This opinion is predicated upon a principle which is believed to be undeniable, that the several states which composed this union, so far at least as regarded their municipal regulations became entitled, from the time when they declared themselves independent, to all the rights and powers of sovereign states, and that they did not derive them from concessions made by the British king. The treaty of peace contains a recognition of their independence, not a grant of it. From hence it results, that the laws of the several state governments were the laws of sovereign states, and as such were obligatory upon the people of such state, from the time they were enacted. We do not mean to intimate an opinion that even the law of a state, whose form of government had been organized prior to the 4th of July, 1776, and which passed prior to that period, would not have been obligatory. The present case renders it unnecessary to be more precise in stating the principle; for although the constitution of New-Jersey was formed previous to the general declaration of independence, the laws passed upon the subject now under consideration were posterior to it.</p>
<p>Having thus ascertained the situation of Daniel Coxe, on the 4th of October, 1776, let us see whether it was in any respect changed by his subsequent conduct, in relation to the new government. Without expressing an opinion upon the right of expatriation as founded on the common law, or upon the application of that principle to a person born in the state of New-Jersey, before its separation from the mother country, we think it conclusive upon the point, that the legislature of that state <span class="star-pagination">*213</span> by the most unequivocal declarations, asserted its right to the allegiance of such of its citizens as had left the state, and had attempted to return to their former allegiance.</p>
<p>The act of the 5th of June, 1777, contains an express declaration that all such persons were subjects of the state, who had been seduced by the enemy from their allegiance. The law speaks of them as jugitives not as aliens, and they are invited, not to become subjects, but to return to their duty, which the legislature clearly considered as still subsisting and obligatory upon them.</p>
<p>The inquiry which the jury is directed to make, by the act of the 18th of April, 1778, in order to lay a foundation for the confiscation of the personal estates of these fugitives is, whether the person had, between the 4th of October, 1776, and the 5th of June, 1777, joined the armies of the king of Great Britain, or otherwise offended against the form of his allegiance to the state. The 7th section of this law is peculiarly important, because it provides not only for past cases, which had occurred since the 5th of June, 1777, but for all future cases, and in all of them, the inquiry is to be whether the offender has joined the armies of the king, or otherwise offended against the form of his allegiance to the state.</p>
<p>During all this time, the real estates of these persons remained vested in them; and when by the law of the 11th of December, 1778, the legislature thought proper to act upon this part of their property, it was declared to be forfeited for their offences, not escheatable on the ground of alienage. This last act is particularly entitled to attention, as it contains a legislative declaration of the point of time, when the right of election to adhere to the old allegiance ceased, and the duties of allegiance to the new government commenced. Those who joined the enemy between the 19th of April, 1775, and the 4th of October, 1776, (when an express declaration upon the subject was made,) and who had not since returned and become subjects in allegiance to the new government, by taking the oaths of abjuration and allegiance, are pronounced guilty of high treason, not for the purpose of affecting them personally, which would have <span class="star-pagination">*214</span> been most unjust; but with a view to the confiscation of their estates. And consistent with this distinction, the jury are to inquire in respect to these persons, not as in the case of those who had left the state after the 4th of October, 1776, whether they had offended against the form of their allegiance, but, whether they are offenders within this act, that is, by having joined the enemy between the 19th of April, 1775, and the 4th of October, 1776, and not having returned and become subjects in allegiance to the state.</p>
<p>Having taken this view of the laws of New-Jersey upon this subject, it may safely be asserted that prior to the treaty of peace, it would not have been competent, even for that state to allege alienage in Daniel Coxe in the face of repeated declarations of the legitimate authority of the government, that he continued to owe allegiance to the state, notwithstanding all his attempts to throw it off. If he was an alien, he must have been so by the laws of New-Jersey; but those laws had uniformly asserted, that he was an offender against the form of his allegiance to the state. How then can this court, acting upon the laws of New-Jersey declare him an alien? The conclusion is inevitable, that, prior to the treaty of peace, Daniel Coxe was entitled to hold, and had a capacity to take lands in New-Jersey by descent.</p>
<p>But it is insisted that the treaty of peace, operating upon his condition at that time, or afterwards, he became an alien to the state of New-Jersey in consequence of his election, then made to become a subject of the king, and his subsequent conduct confirming that election. In vain have we searched that instrument for some clause or expression, which by any implication could work this effect.</p>
<p>It contains an acknowledgment of the independence and sovereignty of the United States, in their political capacities, and a relinquishment on the part of his Britannic majesty, of all claim to the government, propriety and territorial rights of the same. These concessions amounted, no doubt, to a formal renunciation of all claim to the allegiance of the citizens of the United States. But the question who were at that period citizens of the <span class="star-pagination">*215</span> is not decided, or in the slightest degree alluded to in this instrument; it was left necessarily to depend upon the laws of the respective states, who in their sovereign capacities had acted authoritatively upon the subject. It left all such persons in the situation it found them, neither making those citizens, who had by the laws of any of the states been declared aliens, nor releasing from their allegiance, any who had become, and were claimed as citizens. It repeals no laws of any of the states which were then in force, and operating upon this subject, but on the contrary it recognises their validity by stipulating that congress should recommend to the states, the reconsideration of such of them as had worked confiscations. If the laws relating to this subject were at that period, in the language of one of the counsel, temporary and functi officio, they certainly were not rendered so by the terms of the treaty, nor by the political situation of the two nations, in consequence of it. A contrary doctrine is not only inconsistent with the sovereignties of the states, anterior to, and independant of the treaty, but its indiscriminate adoption might be productive of more mischief than it is possible for us to foresee.</p>
<p>If then at the period of the treaty, the laws of New-Jersey which had made Daniel Coxe a subject of that state were in full force, and were not repealed, or in any manner affected by that instrument, if by force of these laws he was incapable of throwing off his allegiance to the state, and derived no right to do so by virtue of the treaty, it follows that he still retains the capacity which he possessed before the treaty, to take lands by descent in New-Jersey, and consequently that the lessor of the plaintiff is entitled to recover.</p>
<p>Judgment must be affirmed with costs.</p>

<p class="date">February Term, 1808</p>
<div class="num" id="p1">
<span class="num">1</span>
<p class="indent">ERROR to the district court for the district of Kentucky, in an action of debt upon an official bond given by <i>Ballinger</i>, as collector of the revenue, and signed and sealed by <i>Pawling, Todd, Adair</i>, and <i>Kennedy</i>, as his sureties, who pleaded that they delivered the same, as an <i>escrow</i>, to <i>one Joseph Ballinger</i>, to be safely kept; upon condition that, if <i>Simon Ingleman</i>, and <i>William Patton</i>, named on the face of the bond, should execute the same as <i>co-sureties</i>, then the bond should be delivered to <i>James Morrison</i>, supervisor, on behalf of the United States, as their deed, and not otherwise; and that the same never was executed by <i>Ingleman</i> and <i>Patton;</i> yet <i>Ballinger</i> delivered it to <i>Morrison</i>, on behalf of the United States, <i>and so not their deed</i>. The delivery as an <i>escrow</i> being traversed by the United States, issue was thereupon joined; in the trial of which the United States demurred to the evidence produced on the part of the defendants, which consisted of the depositions of T. T. Davis, W. G. Bryant, one of the subscribing witnesses, Elijah Stapp, another subscribing witness, John P. Wagnon, another subscribing witness, and a letter from Morrison, the supervisor, to Ballinger. The deposition of Davis states a conversation, between Ballinger and Pawling, some time before the signing of the bond, in which the former told the latter that Todd, Kennedy, Shelby, Knox, Ingleman, Logan, Lewis, and Adair, had agreed to be security for him; upon which Pawling also agreed to become his surety, but upon the express condition that the other persons also should join in the bond. It also states a subsequent conversation between the deponent and Todd, before signing the bond, in which the latter denied that he had agreed to become Ballinger's surety, but said that he should not be apprehensive of danger, if all the men whom Davis had named would join in the bond.â€”The deposition of Bryant states that he saw Pawling, in the presence of Ballinger, sign the bond, on condition that Kennedy, Todd, Adair, Davis, and others, whom the witness did not recollect, should also sign the bond; and he understood that Pawling was to be exonerated if they did not. The deposition of Elijah Stapp states that he saw Pawling, in the hearing of Ballinger, acknowledge the bond as his act and deed, upon condition that others mentioned should also sign it. The deposition of Wagnon states, that when Todd, Adair and Kennedy signed the bond, Todd, in the presence of the other two, after inserting in the bond the names of other persons who he said were to sign it, called upon the witness to take notice that others were to sign it, and said, 'We acknowledge this instrument of writing, but others are to sign it.' The letter from Morrison to Ballinger says, 'I have received your favour by Mr. Davidson, who carries back your bond; not that I require more securities, but that you appeared anxious to have more; those who have already signed are very sufficient.' It was admitted by the attorney for the United States, that the names of Thomas Kennedy, John Adair, Simon Ingleman, and William Patton, inserted in the body of the bond as obligors, were in the hand-writing of the defendant, Todd. This evidence, upon the demurrer, was by the court below adjudged insufficient. The defendants, the sureties, took a bill of exceptions to the refusal of the court to suffer <i>Ballinger</i>, the principal obligor, to be examined as a witness for them, they having severed in their pleas. But as that question was not decided by this court, it is deemed unnecessary to state the arguments of counsel on that point.</p>

<p class="indent">Upon a demurrer to evidence, it is a general rule or law, that the evidence must be taken most strongly against the party demurring; and that the court ought to infer every thing which a jury could reasonably have inferred from the testimony. <i>Doug.</i> 134.

<p class="indent">The <i>law</i> of the plea is admitted by the joining of issue upon the <i>fact</i>. No exception can be taken to the legality of the defence, if the facts of the plea are found to be true. Courts ought to lean against demurrers to evidence, because they take the cause from the jury, which is the proper tribunal to decide the <i>facts</i> of the case, and throw that burden upon the court, whose only duty it is to decide the <i>law</i>. Demurrers to evidence are also extremely inconvenient in practice, especially demurrers to parol testimony, which consume a vast deal of time.</p>

</div>
<div class="num" id="p10">
<span class="num">10</span>
<p class="indent">In this case two points are made for the consideration of the court.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p11">
<span class="num">11</span>
<p class="indent">It is contended by the plaintiffs in error.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p12">
<span class="num">12</span>
<p class="indent">1st. That judgment on the demurrers to evidence should have been rendered for the defendants in the court below.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p13">
<span class="num">13</span>
<p class="indent">2d. That Joseph Ballinger ought to have been admitted as a witness.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p14">
<span class="num">14</span>
<p class="indent">The general doctrine on a demurrer to evidence has been correctly stated at the bar. The party demurring admits the truth of the testimony to which he demurs, and also those conclusions of fact which a jury may fairly draw from that testimony. Forced and violent inferences he does not admit; but the testimony is to be taken most strongly against him, and such conclusions as a jury might justifiably draw, the court ought to draw.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p15">
<span class="num">15</span>
<p class="indent">The point in issue between the parties was the delivery of the instrument on which the suit was instituted. The plaintiffs below contending that it was delivered absolutely, the defendants that it was delivered as an <i>escrow</i>.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p16">
<span class="num">16</span>
<p class="indent">The bond, upon its face, purports to be delivered absolutely; and it is not to be doubted, that obligees would be much more secure against fraud, if the evidence that the writing was delivered as an <i>escrow</i> appeared upon its face, than by admitting parol testimony of that fact. But the law is settled otherwise, and is not to be disturbed by this court.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p17">
<span class="num">17</span>
<p class="indent">The subscribing witnesses to the bond were examined to prove its delivery. Henry Pawling executed it at one time, the other defendants, Kennedy, Todd, and Adair, at a different time. With respect to Pawling, the testimony is as complete as can be required. William G. Bryant deposes that Pawling signed the bond, on condition that other persons, whom he named, should also sign it. The witness understood that, if those other persons should not sign it, Pawling should be exonerated. Elijah Stapp, the other subscribing witness to the signature of Pawling, deposed that 'he saw Pawling acknowledge it as his act and deed, upon condition that others, whom he mentioned, should also sign it.'</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p18">
<span class="num">18</span>
<p class="indent">These are the subscribing witnesses to the bond, and certainly a jury believing them could not have avoided declaring, by their verdict, that the bond was delivered on condition. That condition not having been performed, the bond, as to Pawling, remains an <i>escrow</i>.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p19">
<span class="num">19</span>
<p class="indent">The testimony, with respect to the other defendants, is less positive. The witness, John P. Wagnon, was called in to attest the bond. Thomas Todd, one of the defendants, then sat down and inserted in the body of the bond the names of other persons who, he said, were also to execute the instrument which he then held in his hand.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p20">
<span class="num">20</span>
<p class="indent">Some distinction was taken at the bar between the case of Todd and that of the other defendants. But the court is of opinion that no such distinction exists. The other defendants said nothing. They did not even acknowledge their signatures. Todd, holding the instrument in his hands, called upon the witness to take notice that 'we' (in the plural) 'acknowledge this instrument, but others are to sign it.' The two other obligors being present, and making no other acknowledgment, are clearly to be considered as speaking through Todd, and executing the bond on the terms on which he executed it. Their condition, then, is the same. It is either an <i>escrow</i>, or a writing obligatory with respect to all of them.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p21">
<span class="num">21</span>
<p class="indent">A jury might certainly have found the issue in favour of the plaintiffs below, and a court would have been well satisfied with their verdict. But might they not, without going against evidence, have found the issue in favour of the defendants below?</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p22">
<span class="num">22</span>
<p class="indent">When words are to be proved by witnesses who depend on their memory alone, the precise terms employed by the parties will seldom be recollected, and courts and juries must form their opinions upon the substance and upon all the circumstances. Now to what purpose did the defendants call upon the subscribing witness to take notice that others, as well as themselves, were to execute the writing? To what purpose did they qualify their acknowledgment with this declaration? It could not be in order to show that they depended on Ballinger to procure additional securities, for that was an affair between him and them, of which it was perfectly unnecessary to call on the witness to take notice, if it was to have no influence on the particular fact he was required to attest. There is certainly strong reason for believing that the obligors considered that declaration as explaining and affecting the act with which they connected it.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p23">
<span class="num">23</span>
<p class="indent">It is also of some importance that the defendant, Todd, had previously declared that he should not be apprehensive of becoming a security for Ballinger, provided others, whom he named, should also become securities, and that he inserted the names of others in the bond, in the presence of the witness.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p24">
<span class="num">24</span>
<p class="indent">Although the judges who compose this court might not, perhaps, as jurors, be perfectly satisfied with this testimony, they cannot say that a verdict would not be received, or ought not to be received, which should find the issue in favor of the defendants below. They cannot say that such a verdict would be against evidence. Thinking so, the court is of opinion that the judgment on the demurrer ought to have been in favour of the defendants below.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p25">
<span class="num">25</span>
<p class="indent">It is unnecessary to give any opinion on the second point. The judgment of the court for the district of Kentucky is to be reversed.</p>

<p class="date">February Term, 1808</p>
<div class="prelims">
<p class="indent">ERROR to the circuit court for the district of Maryland, in an action of <i>ussumpsit</i> brought by John and <i>Jeremiah</i> Naylor against <i>Daniel</i> Grant.</p>
<p class="indent">The verdict and judgment below were for the plaintiffs on the <i>second count</i> of the declaration, which stated in substance, that it was agreed between the plaintiffs and defendant, that if the plaintiffs would at the request of the defendant sell and deliver to a John Hackett and <i>Alexander</i> Grant 'divers goods, wares and merchandizes,' he, the defendant, in consideration of the same, promised to pay the plaintiff as much money as <i>they reasonably deserved</i> to have therefor, in case Hackett and Grant did not pay for them; and that, in consideration of the defendant's promise, and at his request, they sold and delivered to Hackett and Grant 'divers goods, wares and merchandizes,' and reasonably deserved to have therefor 2, 168<i>l.</i> sterling, of which the defendant and Hackett and Grant had notice; and which Hackett and Grant did not pay, but refused, and are insolvent; of all which the defendant had notice, and in consideration of the premises promised to pay the plaintiffs the said sum of 2,168<i>l.</i> sterling, of the value, &amp;c. which he has failed to do.</p>
<p class="indent">Upon the issue of <i>non assumpsit</i>, the plaintiffs read in evidence a letter, admitted to be signed by and with the name of the defendant, and directed 'To Messrs. John and <i>Joseph</i> Naylor and Company,' in the following words:</p>
<p class="indent">'<i>Baltimore</i>, 6<i>th April</i>, 1795.</p>
<p class="indent">'Gentlemen,</p>
<p class="indent">'By the recommendation of Mr. Travis, I take the liberty to address you by my son Alexander, who visits England with a view of establishing connexions in the commercial line there in the different manufactories and others. He is concerned with Mr. John Hackett, of this place, under the firm of Hackett and Grant. For their plan I refer to themselves. Have therefore only to add, that I will guaranty their engagements, should you think it necessary, for any transaction they may have with your house.'</p>
<p class="indent">The plaintiffs also produced and offered to read in evidence a commission (with interrogatories, and an exhibit and depositions) directed to two persons, in the usual form, commanding them to take the examination of the witnesses in writing upon the interrogatories, and to send them to the court <i>closed up and under the seals</i> of any two or one of them, and requiring them to take the oath annexed to the commission, but not directing before whom, or in what manner the oath should be taken.</p>
<p class="indent">The depositions under this commission went to prove that there was no commercial house at Wakefield, (the town where the plaintiffs lived), under the name of John and <i>Joseph</i> Naylor and Company. That the firm of the plaintiffs was John and <i>Jeremiah</i> Naylor and Company, and that the Mr. Travis mentioned in the letter was the agent of the plaintiffs. That the letter was in fact intended for that house, and was delivered to it by Alexander Grant, of the house of Hackett and Grant, who obtained goods upon the credit of it, and who became insolvent.</p>
<p class="indent">To that reading of this commission and depositions the defendant objected, contending that the commission was illegally and defectively executed; but the court below overruled the objection, and suffered them to be read.</p>
<p class="indent">The defendant then prayed the court to instruct the jury, that upon this evidence the plaintiffs were not entitled to recover upon either count in the declaration; but the court refused, and instructed the jury that the evidence was <i>proper and legal</i> to <i>support</i> the issue on the part of the plaintiffs, and <i>sufficient in law for that purpose</i>, if by the jury believed to be true, and if they should believe that the letter was intended to be addressed, <i>and was addressed</i>, by the defendant to the plaintiffs.</p>
<p class="indent">To which opinions of the court the defendant excepted, and brought his writ of error.</p>
<p class="indent"><i>Martin</i>, for the plaintiff in error.</p>
<p class="indent">1. The first bill of exceptions brings into view the informality of the execution of the commission to examine witnesses. The authority to issue such a commission, and the mode of executing it, depend upon the act of assembly of Maryland, passed at <i>November session</i>, 1773, <i>c. 7. s. 7.</i> by which it is enacted, 'that <i>such</i> commission shall issue, and the commissioners shall be appointed and qualified, and <i>such</i> interrogatories be proposed or exhibited, and such commission be <i>executed and returned</i>, and the depositions of affidavits taken in pursuance thereof, shall be published in the same manner and form, as in the case of a commission issuing out of the court of chancery for the examination of witnesses residing and living out of this province; and the depositions or affidavits which shall be duly made or taken in virtue of any commission which shall issue in pursuance of this act, or copies thereof duly attested, shall be admitted in evidence at the trial of the cause.'</p>
<p class="indent">The mode of issuing and executing commissions from the court of chancery in Maryland has always been conformable to the English practice, except that, by the <i>act of assembly of</i> 1785, <i>c.</i> 72. <i>s.</i> 15. the parties are permitted to be present at the examination, and may put additional interrogatories.</p>
<p class="indent">1st. We object to the execution of the commission, because it does not appear that the commissioners were sworn according to law. They themselves certify that they took the oath annexed to the commission, but do not say before whom, nor in what manuer. It ought to have been certified by some person who administered the oath, and who was competent in law to administer it; and such certificate ought to show <i>how</i> it was done. It is like the case of a commission to ascertain the boundaries of lands, in which case it has been uniformly holden in Maryland, that if the commissioners only return that they have acted according to law in general terms, their return is insufficient. They must certify in what manner they have executed their commission, that the court may judge whether it be legally executed.</p>
<p class="indent">2d. The commissioners were only authorised to examine witnesses upon the interrogatories sent out with the commission. But it does not appear that any interrogatories were sent with the commission.<a class="footnote" href="#fn-s" id="fn-s_ref">*</a></p>
<p class="indent">3d. The defendant had no notice of the time and place of executing the commission. He filed no interrogatories. Notice is required by the principles of natural justice, and by the constant practice of the court of chancery. 1 <i>Harrison's Ch. Prac.</i> 444.</p>
<p class="indent">4th. The return of the commissioners ought to have been under seal.</p>

<p class="indent">1. Whether the letter of credit rendered the defendant liable to the extent of the plaintiffs' demand.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p16">
<span class="num">16</span>
<p class="indent">2. Whether the objection, arising from the mistake in addressing the plaintiffs as John and <i>Joseph</i>, instead of John and <i>Jeremiah</i>, is not obviated by the proof, without an averment in the declaration that the same persons were meant.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p17">
<span class="num">17</span>
<p class="indent">3. Whether the evidence under the commission was admissible.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p18">
<span class="num">18</span>
<p class="indent">1. On the first point he contended, that it was apparent on the face of the letter, and from the nature of the business in which Hackett and Grant were about to engage, that a continuing guarantee was intended. And that if there was any ambiguity in the expressions of the letter upon that point, they ought to be taken most strongly against the writer, and that a letter of credit was a contract which required to be executed among merchants with peculiar good faith.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p19">
<span class="num">19</span>
<p class="indent">2. Parol evidence was admissible to show that John and <i>Joseph</i> meant John and <i>Jeremiah</i>, 10 <i>Co.</i> 124. and 125(<i>b</i>).</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p20">
<span class="num">20</span>
<p class="indent">It is admitted that if the obligor be sued by the name in the bond, and it be proved by parol that the defendant delivered the bond, he is estopped to deny his name to be as in the bond. So in <i>assumpsit</i>, parol evidence may be given to show that the contract was made with <i>A.</i> by the name of <i>B.</i> and to show that the writing was delivered to <i>A.</i>It is the custom in Europe among merchants to keep the name of a firm long after all the original copartners are dead. Suppose a letter of credit addressed to the old firm be delivered to persons not named in the letter, and they furnish the goodsâ€”shall they not be entitled to recover upon this letter of credit?</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p21">
<span class="num">21</span>
<p class="indent">In the present case, suppose there is no such person as Joseph, then his name is a surplusage, and it is a letter to John. And then what is the objection to a suit in the name of John and Jeremiah?</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p22">
<span class="num">22</span>
<p class="indent">I may state the contract according to its legal import. If a bond be made in the name of John, and James deliver it, it is the bond of James. So may a letter addressed to John and Joseph, delivered to John and Jeremiah, constitute a contract with John and Jeremiah. It was competent to prove that Alexander Grant delivered the letter to John and Jeremiah, and that there was no other firm in Wakefield of the name of <i>Naylor</i>. It was not necessary to state in the declaration that the contract was in writing, nor that John and Joseph meant John and Jeremiah. If John and Jeremiah had drawn a bill of exchange in the name of John and Joseph, John and Jeremiah would have been liable. So on a policy of insurance in the name of <i>A.</i> but for the use of <i>B.</i> it is not necessary to aver it to be so, but an action may be brought directly in the name of <i>B.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p23">
<span class="num">23</span>
<p class="indent">So if I direct my correspondent, having funds in has hand, to make insurance, and he fails to do so, I may charge him as insurer, without stating specially the circumstances which render him liable. So in case of <i>executor de son tort</i>, I charge him as executor generally, without stating the facts of intermeddling with the goods, &amp;c. whereby he is liable to be sued as executor.</p>

<span class="num">40</span>

</div>
<div class="num" id="p51">
<span class="num">51</span>
<p class="indent">In this case three points are made by the plaintiff in error on the letter which constitutes the basis of this action. He contends,</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p52">
<span class="num">52</span>
<p class="indent">1st. That this letter being a collateral undertaking, and being addressed to John and <i>Joseph</i> Naylor and Co. the plaintiffs below cannot be admitted to prove by parol testimony that it was intended for and is an assumpsit to John and <i>Jeremiah</i> Naylor.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p53">
<span class="num">53</span>
<p class="indent">2d. That the undertaking was conditional, and required notice to be given to the writer of the intent and nature of his liability.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p54">
<span class="num">54</span>
<p class="indent">3d. That it is confined to the shipments made during the year in which it was written.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p55">
<span class="num">55</span>
<p class="indent">On the first objection the court has felt considerable difficulty. That the letter was really designed for John and Jeremiah Naylor cannot be doubted, but the principles which require that a promise to pay the debt of another shall be in writing, and which will not permit a written contract to be explained by parol testimony, originate in a general and a wise policy, which this court cannot relax so far as to except from its operation cases within the principles.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p56">
<span class="num">56</span>
<p class="indent">Already have so many cases been taken out of the statute of frauds, which seem to be within its letter, that it may well be doubted whether the exceptions do not let in many of the mischiefs against which the rule was intended to guard. The best judges in England have been of opinion that this relaxing construction of the statute ought not to be extended further than it has already been carried, and this court entirely concurs in that opinion.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p57">
<span class="num">57</span>
<p class="indent">On examining the cases which have been cited at the bar, it does not appear to the court that they authorise the explanation of the contract which is attempted in this case.</p>

<p class="indent">This is not a case of ambiguity.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p59">

<p class="indent">It is not an ambiguity patent, for the face of the letter can excite no doubt.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p60">
<span class="num">60</span>
<p class="indent">It is not a latent ambiguity, for there are not two firms of the name of John and Joseph Naylor and Co. to either of which this letter might have been delivered.</p>

<p class="indent">If it be a case of mistake, it is a mistake of the writer only, not of him by whom the goods were advanced, and who claims the benefit of the promise.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p63">

<p class="indent">Without reviewing all the cases which have been urged from the bar, it may be said with confidence that no one of them is a precedent for this.</p>

<p class="indent">A letter addressed, by mistake it is admitted, to one house, is delivered to another. It contains no application or promise to the company to which it is delivered, but contains an application and a promise to a different company not existing at that place. The company to which it is delivered are not imposed upon with respect to the address, but knowing that the letter was not directed to them, they trust the bearer, who came to make contracts on his own account. In such a case the letter itself is not a written contract between Daniel Grant, the writer, and John and Jeremiah Naylor, the persons to whom it was delivered. To admit parol proof to make it such a contract, is going further than courts have ever gone, where the writing is itself the contract, not evidence of a contract, and where no pre-existing obligation bound the party to enter into it.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p65">
<span class="num">65</span>
<p class="indent">It being the opinion of a majority of the court that John and Jeremiah Naylor could not maintain their action on this letter, it becomes unnecessary to consider the other points which were made at the bar.

<p class="indent">By the 3d article of the constitution of the United States, the judicial power of the United States is extended '<i>to all case of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction</i>.' Congress could not make cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction; and under that clause of the constitution they could not give their courts jurisdiction of a case which was not of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction at the time of the adoption of that constitution. The question, then, is, whether, according to the understanding of the people of this country at that time, a seizure of a vessel, within the body of a county, for breach of a municipal law of trade, was a case of admiralty cognizance. It certainly was never so considered in England, from whence we draw all our ideas of admiralty jurisdiction. All seizures in that country for violation of the laws of revenue, trade, or navigation are tried by a jury in the court of exchequer according to the course of the common law. There is nothing in the course of proceedings <i>in rem</i> which requires that they should be in a court of admiralty. A court of common law is as competent to the trial of such cases as a court of admiralty. The high court of admiralty in England exercises no original jurisdiction in revenue cases. It hears only <i>appeals</i> in such cases from the vice-admiralty courts in the colonies, to whom the jurisdiction is given by an act of parliament. 2 <i>Browne, Civil Law</i>, 492. 2 <i>Rob.</i> 189. <i>The Sarah</i>. 4 <i>Inst.</i> 135. 139. 2 <i>Browne</i>, 75. 78. 3 <i>Bl.

<p class="indent">Nor were such cases ever supposed by the people of this country to be rightfully classed among causes of admiralty. It was one of our serious grievances, and of which we complained against Great Britain in our remonstrances to the King, and in our addresses to the people of Great Britain, while we were colonies, that the jurisdiction of the courts of vice-admiralty was extended to cases of revenue. <i>Journals of the old Congress, vol.</i> 1. <i>p.</i> 47. Such being the understanding of the people of this country at the adoption of the constitution, we are to presume that the words '<i>cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction</i>,' did not include cases of seizure like the present. The 9th section of the judiciary act (<i>vol.</i> 1. <i>p.</i> 53.) is to be construed with a reference to the meaning of those expressions in the constitution; and if it cannot, consistently with the force of its terms, be reconciled with the constitution, it must yield to the superior obligation of that instrument. The words of that section of the act, as far as they affect the present question, are, 'and shall also have exclusive original cognizance of all civil causes of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction, <i>including</i> all seizures under laws of impost, navigation, or trade, of the United States, where the seizures are made on waters which are navigable from the sea by vessels of ten or more tons burthen, within their respective districts as well as upon the high seas: saving to suiters, <i>in all cases</i>, the right of a common law remedy, where the common law is competent to give it; and shall also have exclusive original cognizance of all seizures on land, or other waters than as aforesaid, made, and of all suits for penalties and forfeitures incurred under the laws of the United States.' 'And the trial of issues in fact in the district courts, in all causes, except civil causes of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction, shall be by jury.'</p>

<p class="indent">The district court shall have exclusive original cognizance of <i>all</i> civil causes of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction, <i>including</i>, within its exclusive original cognizance, all seizures, &amp;c. It does not mean <i>including within the expression</i> '<i>all civil causes of admiralty</i>,' &amp;c. If such cases of seizure were civil causes of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction, there was no necessity to enumerate them, because the expression, <i>all</i> civil causes of admiralty, &amp;c. certainly included them. If they were not civil causes of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction, congress could not make them such, nor by forcing them into that class, deprive the citizen of his right to a trial by jury. Congress had no such intention, for in the very same breath they say, 'saving to suiters, in all cases, the right of a common law remedy, where the common law is competent to give it.' We have seen that in all cases of seizure for breaches of the laws of revenue, trade or navigation, the common law is competent to give a remedy; and consequently this suiter is entitled to it.</p>

<p class="indent">In the act for registering vessels, passed the 31st <i>of December</i>, 1792, (<i>Oswald's edition of the Acts of Congress, vol.</i> 2. <i>p.</i> 134. 144. <i>sect.</i> 4. <i>and</i> 16.) if the owner shall take a false oath, 'there shall be a forfeiture of the vessel, &amp;c. or of the value thereof, to be recovered <i>with costs of suit</i>,' of the person taking the false oath. So in case of the sale of a vessel to a foreigner it shall be forfeited in a certain case, 'provided that if it shall be made appear to <i>the jury</i> before whom the trial for such forfeiture shall be had, that,' &amp;c. and the penalties and <i>forfeitures</i>, under that act were to 'be <i>sued for, presecuted</i> and <i>recovered</i>,' in such courts, &amp;c. as penalties and forfeitures under the act for the collection of duties, &amp;c. Hence it is evident that congress intended that all cases of forfeiture should be tried by jury. The expressions in the act respecting registering of vessels, explain what may otherwise appear doubtful in the act concerning the collection of duties, as to the mode of prosecution.</p>

<div class="num" id="p34">

</div>
<div class="num" id="p35">
<span class="num">35</span>
<p class="indent">But by the judiciary act no <i>circuit</i> court could take original cognizance of civil causes of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction; hence it is obvious that congress did not consider such seizures as civil causes of admiralty, &amp;c. The forfeiture also is to accrue to any person 'who will <i>inform</i> and <i>prosecute</i> for the same,' which shows that the proceedings were to be at common law.</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">All the forfeitures under the act for the collection of duties, are to be recovered in the same way. <i>Some</i> of them being cases of seizure on land, must be tried by jury, therefore <i>all</i> must. And in sect. 71. (<i>vol.</i> 4. <i>p.</i> 391.) it is said, 'in <i>actions, suits</i> or <i>informations</i> to be brought, where any seizure shall be made pursuant to this act, if the property be claimed by any person, in every such case the <i>onus probandi</i> shall be upon such claimant.'

<p class="indent">The 89<i>th sect.</i> in <i>p.</i> 427. speaking of the recovery of <i>penalties</i>, clearly refers to suits at common law; and when speaking of <i>forfeitures</i>, it says, 'and all ships, goods, &amp;c. which shall become forfeited in virtue of this act, shall be seized, libelled and <i>prosecuted as aforesaid</i>;' referring to the mode of prosecution pointed out for the recovery of penalties. Here if the word '<i>libelled</i>' had not been used there could be no doubt. But the expression '<i>libelled</i>' relates as well to seizures on land, as to seizures on water; but seizures on land must be tried by jury according to the course of the common law.

The consequence would have been that this case, involving the same fact, between the same parties, could not have been otherwise tried than by a jury.

<center><h1>JOHN AND JAMES TUCKER<br/>
v.<br/>
OXLEY, ASSIGNEE OF T. MOORE, A BANKRUPT.</h1></center>
<center><p><b>Supreme Court of United States.</b></p></center>
<center>February 15, 1809.</center>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*36</span> <i>C. Simms,</i> for the plaintiff in error.</p>
<p><i>Jones,</i> contra.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*39</span> MARSHALL, Ch. J. delivered the opinion of the court, as follows:</p>
<p>In this case the plaintiffs in error, who were defendants in the circuit court, claimed to set off against a debt due from them to Thomas Moore, the bankrupt, a debt previously due to them from the firm of H. and T. Moore, which firm was dissolved, and the partnership fund had passed to T. Moore. This offset was not allowed; and its rejection is the error alleged in the proceedings of the circuit court.</p>
<p>At law, independent of the statute of bankruptcy, the court is of opinion that this discount could not have been made in a suit instituted by Thomas Moore against the Tuckers; and if the words of the act of congress allowing set-off in the case of mutual debts and credits were to be expounded without regard to the provisions of that act in other respects, it is probable that they would not be extended beyond that technical operation, to which has been <span class="star-pagination">*40</span> allowed the term "mutual debts," in ordinary cases. But the bankrupt law changes essentially the relative situation of the parties; and the provisions making that change are thought, by a majority of the court, to have a material influence on the words of the 42d section of the act, which provide for the case of mutual debts and credits.</p>
<p>It is the opinion of the court that this is a debt, which might have been proved under the 6th section of the act. It is a debt, which, by a suit against both the partners, might have been recovered against either of them, and either might have been compelled to pay the whole. Although due from the company, yet it is also due from each member of the company; and the claim of the creditor for its satisfaction extended, previous to the act of bankruptcy, to the whole property of each member of the firm, as well as to the joint property of the firm. It would be certainly impairing that claim to apply, by the operation of law, the whole particular fund to other creditors, who, at the time of the bankruptcy, had not a better legal claim on that fund than the Tuckers, without allowing them to participate in it. The court, therefore, would be much inclined to consider the creditors of the partnership as having a right, under the general description of creditors of the bankrupt, to prove their debts before the commissioners. But all doubt on this subject seems to be removed by the <i>proviso</i> to the 34th section. That section declares, that the bankrupt shall be discharged from all debts which were due from him at the date of the bankruptcy, and all which were or might have been proved under the said commission, "Provided that no such discharge of a bankrupt shall release or discharge any person, who was a partner with such bankrupt at the time he or she became bankrupt, or who was then jointly held or bound with such bankrupt for the same debt or debts, from which such bankrupt was discharged as aforesaid."</p>
<p>Thomas Moore, then, is discharged from the debt due from Henry and Thomas Moore to the Tuckers; and if he is discharged therefrom, it would seem to <span class="star-pagination">*41</span> be an infraction of their pre-existing rights not to allow them a share of his property. It is deemed by the court material in the construction of this statute, that, as the proviso shows the joint creditors to be within the description of the terms creditors of the bankrupt, so as to enable them to prove their debts under the commission, they are of necessity comprehended within the same terms in those sections which direct to whom the dividends are to be made. The words of the 29th and 30th sections are imperative. They command the commissioners to divide the estate of the bankrupt among such of his creditors as shall have made due proof of their debts, in proportion to the amount of their claims. Consequently, every creditor who proves his debt is entitled to a dividend.</p>
<p>But, although the creditors of H. and T. Moore might have proved their debt before the commissioners, and have received a dividend out of the estate of the bankrupt, it may be contended that, having failed to do so, they are not entitled to set off their whole claim.</p>
<p>The 42d section of the act directs, that where it shall appear to the commissioners that there hath been mutual credit given by the bankrupt and any other person, or mutual debts between them at any time before such person became bankrupt, the assignee or assignees of the estate shall state the account between them, and one debt may be set off against the other; and what shall appear to be due on either side, on the balance of such account, after such set-off, and no more, shall be claimed or paid on either side respectively.</p>
<p>The term "debt," as used in this section, is fairly to be construed to mean any debt for which the act provides. A debt which may be proved Before the commissioners, and to the owner of which a dividend must be paid, is a debt in the sense of the term as used in this section.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*42</span> Were this doubtful, it cannot be denied that the advantage given by the section is reciprocal, and in any case where the set-off would be allowed, if the balance was against the bankrupt, it must be allowed if in his favour. It has already been stated that the Tuckers might have proved their claim before the commissioners. Can it be doubted that the whole of the debt due to the bankrupt would, under this section, have been deducted from that claim? We think it cannot be doubted. Then, the terms applying alike to each party, the debt due to the Tuckers must be set off from that which they owe the bankrupt.</p>
<p>If the "assignee of the estate ought to have stated the account," and have only claimed the balance, his omitting so to do cannot enlarge his rights; he can only recover what he ought to have claimed.</p>
<p>This, which seems to be the naked law of the case, is not unreasonable. It is fair to conclude that the Tuckers forbore to recover the money due to them from H. and T. Moore, in consideration of their dealings with T. Moore, after he traded on his separate account.</p>
<p>This exposition of the bankrupt act appears to the court to conform to that which is given in England. As the bankrupt law of the United States, so far as respects this case, is almost, if not completely, copied from that of England, the decisions which have been made on that law by the English judges may be considered as having been adopted with the text they expounded.</p>
<p>In England, it has never been doubted that a man, having a claim on two persons, might become a petitioning creditor for the bankruptcy of one of them. Such petitioning creditor has always been admitted to prove his debt before the commissioners, and to receive his dividends, in proportion, with the other creditors. He is, then, in contemplation of the act, a creditor of the bankrupt; and, consequently, all the <span class="star-pagination">*43</span> provisions of the act apply to him, as to other creditors. This would seem to prove that, under the legal operation of the act, a creditor of a firm, of which the bankrupt was one, and a creditor of the bankrupt singly, were equally creditors of the bankrupt, in contemplation of the law, and were construed to come equally within the meaning of the term, as used in the act. If this position be correct, the rules which we find laid down by the chancellor, for marshalling the respective funds, are to be considered merely as equitable restraints on the legal rights of parties, obliging them to exercise those rights in such manner as not to do injustice to others. This is the peculiar province of a court of chancery. It is the same, in principle, with the common case of marshalling assets, where specialty creditors, who have a right to satisfaction out of lands, exhaust the personal estate, to the injury of simple contract creditors.</p>
<p>It is undoubtedly unjust that the Tuckers, having a claim on H. and T. Moore, and being able to obtain payment from H. Moore, should satisfy that claim entirely out of the separate estate of T. Moore, to the exclusion of other creditors, who had no resort to Henry; and it is probable that a court of chancery might restrain this use of his legal rights within equitable limits. But suppose H. Moore, also, to be a bankrupt; or to be insolvent, and unable to pay the debt; would it not be equally unjust to apply the estate of each individual to the discharge of the several debts, to the entire exclusion of their joint creditors, who, previous to their bankruptcy, had a legal and equitable right to satisfaction out of the separate estate of each?</p>
<p>Mr. Cooke has made a very good collection of the decisions in England, on this question. It will be found that a creditor of the partnership was first permitted by consent to prove his debt before the commissioners of the individual bankrupt, and to receive dividends from the separate fund. It was afterwards decided by the chancellor that he had a right <span class="star-pagination">*44</span> so to do: and in conformity with this decision was the regular course of the court, until the year 1796. During this time, however, the chancellor, sitting, as chancellor, on a bill suggesting equitable considerations for restraining the order he had made, was accustomed to enjoin the dividends which he had ordered, sitting in bankruptcy. This would seem to prove that, at law, the creditor of the partnership had a right to his dividends from the separate fund, but that equity would compel him first to exhaust the joint fund.</p>
<p>In 1796, this whole subject was reviewed in the case <i>Ex parte Elton,</i> reported in 3 <i>Ves.</i> jun. This case has been considered as overruling former decisions; but, in the opinion of the court, it confirms the principle already stated. After stating his objection to the prevailing practice, because each order carried in its bosom a suit in chancery, the chancellor took time to consider the subject; and finally determined that the petitioner should be permitted to prove his debt, and that his dividend should be set apart, but not paid to him until an account should be taken of the joint fund.</p>
<p>It is perfectly clear that, in this case, the chancellor, for convenience, exercised, at the same time, his common law and equitable jurisdiction. In conformity with the uniform exposition of the act, he permitted the partnership creditor to prove his debt before the commissioners of the bankrupt, and directed the dividend to be allotted to him out of the separate fund; and then, without the expense of a bill, exercising his equitable powers, he suspended the payment of this dividend, until it should be ascertained how much of it a court of equity would permit the creditor to receive. This does not negative, but affirms, the legal right of a partnership creditor to come on the separate fund.</p>
<p>It appears also to be admitted, that if the particular creditors should be satisfied without exhausting the fund, the residue might be paid to the partnership <span class="star-pagination">*45</span> creditors. This seems to admit the legal right of those creditors to prove their debts, and to recore their dividends. It is equity, not law, which can postpone them.</p>
<p>It is the opinion of a majority of the court, that the circuit court erred in rendering a judgment on thi special verdict for the sum of 143 dollars and 33 cets, instead of the sum of 16 dollars and 63 cents; which was the balance after deducting the debt due from H. and T. Moore to the defendants in that cort. It is therefore considered by the court, that the said judgment be reversed and annulled; and the judgment be rendered for the plaintiffs in the circuit court for the sum of 16 dollars and 63 cents, and the costs in the circuit court.</p>
<p>Judgment reversed.</p>

<div class="num" id="p6">

<span class="num">9</span>
<p class="indent">Subsequent to the passage of the law for the erection of the <i>Zaneville</i> district, and prior to the time when the office of receiver of public moneys for the Marietta district became vacant, two entries were made in the Marietta land-office, of land lying within the <i>Zaneville</i> district, which entries and sales were acknowledged as good and valid by the government of the United States, who considered Matthews's entry as void, and the secretary of the treasury has directed his purchase-money to be repaid to him. The two tracts, the sales of which were confirmed by the government of the United States, were in the surveyor-general's schedule returned as sold at Marietta; but the land in controversy was not included in that schedule, because the register of the land-office at Marietta had not made his return, as by law directed, to the surveyor-general, who had no guide by which to make out the schedule, but the returns of the register. The officers of the Zaneville land-office were directed by the secretary of the treasury to receive the schedule as the <i>only evidence</i> of what land had been sold at Marietta.</p>

<p class="indent">That this subject may be distinctly understood, it may be necessary concisely to state the land system of the United States.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p16">
<span class="num">16</span>
<p class="indent">In 1785, the old congress passed an ordinance for the survey and sale of public lands in the north-western territory. Seven ranges of townships were laid off, and sales made at <i>New-York</i>, to a considerable extent. The Indian wars that soon followed, closed the sales. But after General Wayne's treaty at Greeneville, in 1795, congress took up the subject again, and in May, 1796, passed an act for appointing a surveyor-general, and directing surveys and sales. <i>Vol.</i> 3. <i>p.</i> 293. These surveys could not be completed till the end of the year 1799. The act of the 10th of May, 1800, <i>vol.</i> 5 <i>p.</i> 174. established the present system, by which four land-offices were to be opened, viz. at <i>Cincinnati, Chilicothe, Marietta</i>, and <i>Steubenville</i>. That at <i>Marietta</i> was for the lands lying east of the <i>sixteenth</i> range of townships, south of the military lands, and south of a line drawn due west from the north-west corner of the first township of the second range to the military lands. A register of the land office, and a receiver of public moneys, was to be appointed for each of the offices. A person wishing to purchase any of the lands was to pay to the treasurer of the United States, or the receiver of public moneys, one twentieth part of the purchase-money besides certain fees, and take his receipt therefor, which he was to carry to the register, who was to enter his application in a book, stating the date of the application, the date of the receipt, and the number of the section, or half section, township and range applied for. No lands were to be sold at less than two dollars an acre, one fourth, including the one twentieth, in forty days, one fourth in two years, one fourth in three years, and the residue in four years, with interest. A discount of 8 <i>per cent. per annum</i> was to be allowed for prompt payment. Upon payment of the whole purchase-money a patent was to be issued by the president of the United States.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p17">
<span class="num">17</span>
<p class="indent">Thus stood the land system, and the mode of purchasing and acquiring title until congress, desirous of bringing more lands into the market, passed an act on the 3<i>d of March</i>, 1803, <i>vol.</i> 6. <i>p.</i> 291. by the 6th section of which, a new district was created called the <i>Zaneville</i> district, which covered part of the lands in Marietta district, and, among others, the lands in controversy, and certain lands in the military tract which had not been surveyed. This act did not prescribe the time when the land-office should be opened at <i>Zaneville</i>, nor when the officers should be appointed.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p18">
<span class="num">18</span>
<p class="indent">The first question which presents itself under this law is, did it prevent a continuance of sales at Marietta, of the lands which had been surveyed in that district, and how included in the <i>Zaneville</i> district?</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p19">
<span class="num">19</span>
<p class="indent">We contend it did not.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p20">
<span class="num">20</span>
<p class="indent">All these laws are to be construed together as forming one system. The two great principles of the system are,</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p21">
<span class="num">21</span>
<p class="indent"><i>Settlement</i> of the western frontier, and <i>revenue</i> to be derived from the sales of the lands.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p22">
<span class="num">22</span>
<p class="indent">The importance of the first, and the policy of settling the western frontier, are too obvious for illustration. It has been an object of anxiety at all times from the first organization of the union.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p23">
<span class="num">23</span>
<p class="indent">As an object of revenue it has been the incessant subject of attention, and of primary importance. The proceeds of the sales were in 1790 assigned to the sinking fund. With a view to facilitate sales, the lands have been divided into sections and half sections. Discounts, and abatement of interest, have been allowed on prompt payment. The sale of the western lands, therefore, being a leading object of national policy, it is to be presumed that they were not to cease unless by positive law.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p24">
<span class="num">24</span>
<p class="indent">There is nothing in the act creating the <i>Zaneville</i> district to prevent a sale at <i>Marietta</i>, before the <i>Zaneville</i> office should be opened.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p25">
<span class="num">25</span>
<p class="indent">There is nothing repugnant to such a construction. Both acts may so far stand together, and be consistent with each other and with the general policy of the United States.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p26">
<span class="num">26</span>
<p class="indent">The 5th and 6th sections of the act of 1803, taken together, show that a previous survey was to be made of the unappropriated military lands which were to form a part of the <i>Zaneville</i> district, before the sales could commence there.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p27">
<span class="num">27</span>
<p class="indent">The 4th section of the act of 1800, gave full powers to the <i>Marietta</i> land-office to sell all the lands within that district.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p28">
<span class="num">28</span>
<p class="indent">This power exists until destroyed, and cannot be repealed by doubtful implication against the great national policy and the scope of the laws. It was well understood that the Zaneville land-office could not be opened until a survey should be made. Officers were to be appointed; and none were appointed until a year after, because they could not act until the surveys should be completed, and the lands ready for sale.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p29">
<span class="num">29</span>
<p class="indent">This shows what construction the executive gave to the law. The surveyor-general also returned a list of sales made at Marietta, up to the 17th of May, 1804. All the sales upon that list have been confirmed by the treasury.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p30">
<span class="num">30</span>
<p class="indent">In the course of the year 1803 a survey was made, and congress, by the act of the 26<i>th of March</i>, 1804, <i>vol.</i> 7. <i>p.</i> 106. Â§ 12. opened the Zaneville land-office on the 21st of May, 1804, and directed the sales to commence there on that day.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p31">
<span class="num">31</span>
<p class="indent">Is it a reasonable construction to contend that 700,000 acres should be locked up from market for a whole year, when every act of the government demonstrated their anxiety to make sales.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p32">
<span class="num">32</span>
<p class="indent">The act of 1803 described limits within which as office was erected for future sales, but the opening of that office and proceeding to sell was to be settled by a future law. This was done, and the office directed to go into operation on the 21st of May, 1804. Until that period the office at Marietta might proceed to sell.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p33">

<p class="indent">Suppose a district, for the collection of duties, divided, and a new port of entry established, and a collector to be appointed, would this put a stop to the entry and collection at the first port until the second office was open for business?</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p35">

<p class="indent">The schedule of the surveyor-general was not the only admissible evidence of sales at the Marietta office. There was no statute, nor any principle of law, which made it such. It was a matter <i>in pais</i>, which might be proved by any kind of legal evidence. The register's certificate which Matthews produced at the Zaneville office at the time and place of sale to Zane, was the very best evidence which could then be required; and it ought to have been respected. Zane purchased with a full knowledge of Matthews's title.</p>

The act provides for the appointment of officers to sell. Congress had only to create the office. The president was to appoint the officers, under the general authority given to him by the constitution. If the president did not appoint, that did not prevent the effect of the act. The president cannot dispense with the law, nor suspend its operation.</p>

<center><h1>THE UNITED STATES<br/>
v.<br/>
JUDGE PETERS.</h1></center>
<center><p><b>Supreme Court of United States.</b></p></center>
<center>February 20, 1809.</center>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*135</span> <i>John Serjeant,</i> attorney for defendants.</p>
<p>MARSHALL, Ch. J. delivered the opinion of the court as follows:</p>
<p>With great attention, and with serious concern, the court has considered the return made by the judge for the district of Pennsylvania to the <i>mandamus</i> directing him to execute the sentence pronounced by him in the case of <i>Gideon Olmstead and others</i> v. <i>Rittenhouse's Executrixes,</i> or to show cause for not so doing. The cause shown is an act of the legislature of Pennsylvania, passed subsequent to the rendition of his sentence. This act authorizes and requires the governor to demand, for the use of the state of Pennsylvania, the money which had been decreed to Gideon Olmstead and others; and which was in the hands of the executrixes of David Rittenhouse; and, in default of payment, to direct the attorney-general to institute a suit for the recovery thereof. This act further authorizes and requires the governor to use any further means he <span class="star-pagination">*136</span> may think necessary for the protection of what it denominates "the just rights of the state," and also to protect the persons and properties of the said executrixes of David Rittenhouse, deceased, against any process whatever, issued out of any federal court in consequence of their obedience to the requisition of the said act.</p>
<p>If the legislatures of the several states may, at will, annul the judgments of the courts of the United States, and destroy the rights acquired under those judgments, the constitution itself becomes a solemn mockery; and the nation is deprived of the means of enforcing its laws by the instrumentality of its own tribunals. So fatal a result must be deprecated by all; and the people of Pennsylvania, not less than the citizens of every other state, must feel a deep interest in resisting principles so destructive of the union, and in averting consequences so fatal to themselves.</p>
<p>The act in question does not, in terms, assert the universal right of the state to interpose in every case whatever; but assigns, as a motive for its interposition in this particular case, that the sentence, the execution of which it prohibits, was rendered, in a cause over which the federal courts have no jurisdiction.</p>
<p>If the ultimate right to determine the jurisdiction of the courts of the union is placed by the constitution in the several state legislatures, then this act concludes the subject; but if that power necessarily resides in the supreme judicial tribunal of the nation, then the jurisdiction of the district court of Pennsylvania, over the case in which that jurisdiction was exercised, ought to be most deliberately examined; and the act of Pennsylvania, with whatever respect it may be considered, cannot be permitted to prejudice the question.</p>
<p>In the early part of the war between the United States and Great Britain, Gideon Olmstead and <span class="star-pagination">*137</span> others, citizens of Connecticut, who say they had been carried to Jamaica as prisoners, were employed as part of the crew of the sloop Active, bound from Jamaica to New-York, and laden with a cargo for the use of the British army in that place. On the voyage they seized the vessel, confined the captain, and sailed for Egg Harbour. In sight of that place, the Active was captured by the <i>Convention,</i> an armed ship belonging to the state of Pennsylvania, brought into port, libelled and condemned as prize to the captors. From this sentence Gideon Olmstead and others, who claimed the vessel and cargo, appealed to the court of appeals established by congress, by which tribunal the sentence of condemnation was reversed, the Active and her cargo condemned as prize to the claimants, and process was directed to issue out of the court of admiralty, commanding the marshal of that court to sell the said vessel and cargo, and to pay the net proceeds to the claimants.</p>
<p>The mandate of the appellate court was produced in the inferior court, the judge of which admitted the general jurisdiction of the court established by congress, as an appellate court, but denied its power to control the verdict of a jury which had been rendered in favour of the captors, the officers and crew of the <i>Convention;</i> and therefore refused obedience to the mandate: but directed the marshal to make the sale, and, after deducting charges, to bring the residue of the money into court, subject to its future order.</p>
<p>The claimants then applied to the judges of appeals, for an injunction to prohibit the marshal from paying the money, arising from the sales, into the court of admiralty; which was awarded, and served upon him: in contempt of which, on the 4th of January, 1778, he paid the money to the judge, who acknowledged the receipt thereof at the foot of the marshal's return.</p>
<p>On the 1st of May, 1799, George Ross, the judge <span class="star-pagination">*138</span> of the court of admiralty, delivered to David Rittenhouse, who was then treasurer of the state of Pennsylvania, the sum of 11,496<i>l.</i> 9<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i> in loan-office certificates; which was the proportion of the prize money to which that state would have been entitled, had the sentence of the court of admiralty remained in force. On the same day, David Rittenhouse executed a bond of indemnity to George Ross, in which, after reciting that the money was paid to him for the use of the state of Pennsylvania, he binds himself to repay the same, should the said George Ross be thereafter compelled, by due course of law, to pay that sum according to the decree of the court of appeals.</p>
<p>These loan-office certificates were in the name of Matthew Clarkson, who was marshal of the court of admiralty, and were dated the 6th of November, 1778. Indents were issued on them to David Rittenhouse, and the whole principal and interest were afterwards funded by him, in his own name, under the act of congress making provision for the debt of the United States.</p>
<p>Among the papers of David Rittenhouse was a memorandum, made by himself at the foot of a list of the certificates mentioned above, in these words: "Note. The above certificates will be the property of the state of Pennsylvania, when the state releases me from the bond I gave in 1778, to indemnify George Ross, Esq. judge of the admiralty, for paying the 50 original certificates into the treasury, as the state's share of the prize."</p>
<p>The state did not release David Rittenhouse from the bond mentioned in this memorandum. These certificates remained in the private possession of David Rittenhouse, who drew the interest on them during his life, and after his death they remained in possession of his representatives; against whom the libel in this case was filed, for the purpose of carrying into execution the decree of the court of appeals.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*139</span> While this suit was depending, the state of Pennsylvania forbore to assert its title, and, in January, 1803, the court decreed in favour of the libellants; soon after which, the legislature passed the act which has been stated.</p>
<p>It is contended that the federal courts were deprived of jurisdiction, in this cause, by that amendment of the constitution which exempts states from being sued in those courts by individuals. This amendment declares, "that the judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit, in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by citizens of another state, or by citizens or subjects of any foreign state."</p>
<p>The right of a state to assert, as plaintiff, any interest it may have in a subject, which forms the matter of controversy between individuals, in one of the courts of the United States, is not affected by this amendment; nor can it be so construed as to oust the court of its jurisdiction, should such claim be suggested. The amendment simply provides, that no suit shall be commenced or prosecuted against a state. The state cannot be made a defendant to a suit brought by an individual; but it remains the duty of the courts of the United States to decide all cases brought before them by citizens of one state against citizens of a different state, where a state is not necessarily a defendant. In this case, the suit was not instituted against the state or its treasurer, but against the executrixes of David Rittenhouse, for the proceeds of a vessel condemned in the court of admiralty, which were admitted to be in their possession. If these proceeds had been the actual property of Pennsylvania, however wrongfully acquired, the disclosure of that fact would have presented a case on which it was unnecessary to give an opinion; but it certainly can never be alleged, that a mere suggestion of title in a state to property, in possession of an individual, must arrest the proceedings of the court, and prevent their <span class="star-pagination">*140</span> looking into the suggestion, and examining the validity of the title.</p>
<p>If the suggestion in this case be examined, it is deemed perfectly clear that no title whatever to the certificates in question was vested in the state of Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>By the highest judicial authority of the nation it has been long since decided, that the court of appeals erected by congress had full authority to revise and correct the sentences of the courts of admiralty of the several states, in prize causes. That question, therefore, is at rest. Consequently, the decision of the court of appeals in this case annulled the sentence of the court of admiralty, and extinguished the interest of the state of Pennsylvania in the <i>Active</i> and her cargo, which was acquired by that sentence. The full right to that property was immediately vested in the claimants, who might rightfully pursue it, into whosesoever hands it might come. These certificates, in the hands, first, of Matthew Clarkson, the marshal, and afterwards of George Ross, the judge, of the court of admiralty, were the absolute property of the claimants. Nor did they change their character on coming into the possession of David Rittenhouse.</p>
<p>Although Mr. Rittenhouse was treasurer of the state of Pennsylvania, and the bond of indemnity which he executed states the money to have been paid to him for the use of the state of Pennsylvania, it is apparent that he held them in his own right, until he should be completely indemnified by the state. The evidence to this point is conclusive. The original certificates do not appear to have been deposited in the state treasury, to have been designated in any manner as the property of the state, or to have been delivered over to the successor of David Rittenhouse. They remained in his possession. The indents, issued upon them for interest, were drawn by David Rittenhouse, and preserved with the original certificates. When funded as <span class="star-pagination">*141</span> part of the debt of the United States, they were funded by David Rittenhouse, and the interest was drawn by him. The note made by himself at the foot of the list, which he preserved, as explanatory of the whole transaction, demonstrates that he held the certificates as security against the bond he had executed to George Ross; and that bond was obligatory, not on the state of Pennsylvania, but on David Rittenhouse, in his private capacity.</p>
<p>These circumstances demonstrate, beyond the possibility of doubt, that the property, which represented the Active and her cargo, was to possession, not of the state of Pennsylvania, but of David Rittenhouse as an individual; after whose death it passed, like other property, to his representatives.</p>
<p>Since, then, the state of Pennsylvania had neither possession of, nor right to, the property on which the sentence of the district court was pronounced, and since the suit was neither commenced nor prosecuted against that state, there remains no pretext for the allegation that the case is within that amendment of the constitution which has been cited; and, consequently, the state of Pennsylvania can possess no constitutional right to resist the legal process which may be directed in this cause.</p>
<p>It will be readily conceived that the order which this court is enjoined to make by the high obligations of duty and of law, is not made without extreme regret at the necessity which has induced the application. But it is a solemn duty, and therefore must be performed. <i>A peremptory mandamus must be awarded.</i></p>

</div>

<p class="indent">Upon the trial of the cause upon the general issue, a bill of exceptions was taken by the plaintiff, which presents the following case:</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p3">
<span class="num">3</span>
<p class="indent">Grace Coxe, the lessor of the plaintiff, being seised in fee of the land in question, before the year 1772 intermarried with John Tabor Kempe, who died in August, 1792. They resided in New-York before and during the war with Great Britain, and vent to Great Britain when New-York was evacuated by the British army. Grace Kempe, since the death of her husband, has continued to reside, and now resides, in Great Britain, where he died; having been in possession of the land in right of his wife, on the first of March, 1776, and until the same was seized by the authority of the state of New-Jersey.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p4">

<p class="indent">The defendants relied upon several acts of the legislature of New-Jersey; an inquisition taken under the authority of those acts; a judgment of the inferior court of common pleas for the county of Hunterdon, in May, 1779, upon that inquisition, confiscating the estate; a judgment of the inferior court of common pleas for the county of Sussex; an execution upon that judgment; and a deed from Joseph Gaston, an agent for the state of New-Jersey, to the defendant Kennedy, whose tenant the other defendant was; and proved, that he had always been in possession under that deed from the day of its date, to the day of trial.</p>

<div class="num" id="p8">

<p class="indent">The great objection is, that Mrs. Kempe was not an object of those laws.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p9">
<span class="num">9</span>
<p class="indent">The whole question depends upon the act of the 11th of December, 1778, entitled 'An act for forfeiting to, and vesting in, the state of New-Jersey, the real estates of certain fugitives and offenders, and for directing the mode of determining and satisfying the lawful debts and demands which may be due from, or made against, such fugitives and offenders, and for other purposes therein mentioned;' by the 3d section of which it is enacted, 'that each and every, person, not an inhabitant of this state, but of some of the other United States, and seised or possessed of, interested in, or entitled unto, any estate, real or personal, within this state, who hath, since the 19th day of April, 1775, aided or assisted, or doth now, or hereafter may, aid or assist the enemies of this state, or of the United States, by joining their armies within this state, or elsewhere, or who already hath, or hereafter shall have, voluntarily gone to, taken refuge or continued with, or endeavoured to continue with, the enemy aforesaid, and aid them by counsel, or otherwise, shall be, and is hereby declared to be, guilty of high treason against this state; and on conviction thereof by inquisition found, and final judgment entered thereon in favour of the state, in manner herein after declared, such conviction shall amount to a full and absolute forfeiture of such offender's estate, both real and personal whatsoever, within this state, to and for the use of the same. Provided always, that such conviction shall not in any instance extend to affect the person of any such offender, but shall operate against his or her estate only.'</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p10">
<span class="num">10</span>
<p class="indent">Mrs. Kempe does not come within any of the descriptions of offenders in this section.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p11">
<span class="num">11</span>
<p class="indent">The inquisition charges, that Kempe and wife are offenders against the act of 11th of December, 1778, in this, 'that the said John Tabor Kempe and Grace his wife, <i>did go</i> to the enemy, and <i>took refuge</i> with them some time in April, 1776, and <i>still remain with them</i>,' 'against the form of their allegiance to this state.'</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p12">
<span class="num">12</span>
<p class="indent">The truth of the fact is, that they did not go to the enemy, but remained at their own homes, and the enemy came to them.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p13">
<span class="num">13</span>
<p class="indent">But take the fact as charged; <i>she and her husband</i>, i. e. <i>she in company will her husband; and legally, by the command and control of her husband</i>, in April, 1776, went to the British and remained with them.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p14">
<span class="num">14</span>
<p class="indent">This is a joint charge for a joint act of the husband and wife; and is in the technical language always used when the wife is charged with concurring in the act of the husband.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p15">
<span class="num">15</span>
<p class="indent">Here then is a <i>feme covert</i> charged under this section for accompanying her baron in <i>April</i>, 1776, before any government was established, before any law defining treason, and even before New-Jersey had formed her constitution, and before any prohibition of the act done by her. She simply <i>remained with her husband</i>, without affording any aid to the enemy.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p16">
<span class="num">16</span>
<p class="indent">Such a person is not within the purview of this section, and therefore, though the forfeiture perhaps operated on the interest of the husband, it did not reach the estate of the wife.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p17">
<span class="num">17</span>
<p class="indent">We contend,</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p18">
<span class="num">18</span>
<p class="indent">1. That this section does not extend to <i>femes covert</i> acting with, and therefore by presumption of law under control of, their husbands.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p19">
<span class="num">19</span>
<p class="indent">And, 2. That if it did extend to any <i>feme covert</i>, yet it did not extend to one who only <i>went</i> and <i>remained;</i> she must have <i>aided and assisted</i>.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p20">
<span class="num">20</span>
<p class="indent">1. No <i>feme covert</i> is within the act. It is confined to those who <i>voluntarily</i> go and remain. It supposes a <i>free will</i>, a <i>volition</i>, an election to go or stay: but a <i>feme covert</i> in the presence of her baron, has no will; and on the subject of residence, she can have no will different from his. She is bound by law to live with him if he requires it. This would be the case at all times, even after the passing of these laws; for as freedom of will is of the essence of all crimes, a woman cannot commit a crime of this sort, not even this species of treason, by obeying her husband.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p21">
<span class="num">21</span>
<p class="indent">But when this fact was done there was neither government nor law to offend against. The only law which existed placed her under the dominion of her husband. He had the right to command, and the power to compel her to go and remain with him, and she had neither right to refuse, nor power to resist.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p22">
<span class="num">22</span>
<p class="indent">But if these laws had then existed, she could not be charged for any breach of them in company with her husband. 1 <i>Hawk.</i> 3. Â§ 9. 1 <i>Hale</i>, 47. Receiving her husband, knowing him to be a traitor, is not treason.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p23">
<span class="num">23</span>
<p class="indent">The facts of her coverture, and going and remaining with her husband, appear upon the face of the inquisition itself, and clearly show that she could not have been an offender against the act, and therefore that <i>her</i> estate was not forfeited.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p24">
<span class="num">24</span>
<p class="indent">Nor can the legislature be presumed to have intended to include persons in her situation; for that would have been cruel. They did not mean to legislate against the most important duties of social and domestic life, to cut asunder the bands of matrimonial union, to compel a wife to abandon her husband or forfeit her estate.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p25">
<span class="num">25</span>
<p class="indent">Mrs. Kempe, not having the capacity voluntarily to commit the offence, was not an object of the law, and, consequently, the justice who took the inquisition had not jurisdiction as it regarded her. The inquisition itself does not charge the act to be done by her voluntarily; and this being essential to the offence, ought to have been <i>directly</i> charged. No implication is sufficient. 2 <i>Hawk.</i> 354. Â§ 110. Penal laws are to be construed strictly, especially as to the description of the offender; and general words ought to be so restrained as not to include innocent persons if they can be otherwise satisfied.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p26">
<span class="num">26</span>
<p class="indent">The person who is the proper object of the act must be an inhabitant of some state other than New-Jersey. A <i>feme covert</i> cannot properly be called an inhabitant of a state. The husband is the inhabitant. By the constitution of New-Jersey, all inhabitants are entitled to vote; but it has never been supposed that a <i>feme covert</i> was a legal voter. Single women have been allowed to vote, because the law supposes them to have wills of their own.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p27">
<span class="num">27</span>
<p class="indent">The word '<i>her</i>' in the last clause of the section may be satisfied by restricting its sense to single women.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p28">
<span class="num">28</span>
<p class="indent">If this act be not limited to those acting <i>sui juris</i>, it may as well comprehend infants at the breast as <i>femes covert</i>.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p29">
<span class="num">29</span>
<p class="indent">In the case of <i>Martin</i> v. <i>The Commonwealth of Massachusetts</i>, 1 <i>Williams's Mass. Rep.</i> 390. it was decided that a <i>feme covert</i> did not forfeit her lands by joining the enemy with her husband; and the reasoning of the judges in that case applies with equal force to this.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p30">
<span class="num">30</span>
<p class="indent">2. If the provisions of this act extend to any <i>feme covert</i>, yet they do not extend to one in the situation of Mrs. Kempt; for by the very words of the act, she must not only have '<i>voluntarily</i> gone to, taken refuge, or continued with, or endeavoured to continue with, the enemy,' but she must also have '<i>aided</i> them by counsel or otherwise.'</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p31">
<span class="num">31</span>
<p class="indent">The inquisition does not find that she aided them in any manner. The species of treason intended to be described was that of adhering to the enemies of the country, giving them aid and comfort, as defined by the statute of Edw. III.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p32">
<span class="num">32</span>
<p class="indent">It is clear then that Mrs. Kempe was not an offender against that law, and consequently her estate not forfeitable under it.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p33">
<span class="num">33</span>
<p class="indent">But an important point still remains to be decided, viz. what is to be the consequence of this improper construction? are the proceedings merely <i>erroneous</i>, or are they <i>void?</i> are they good until reversed, or a nullity <i>ab initio?</i> If merely erroneous and good until reversed, the judgment of the circuit court must be affirmed. But if the proceedings are void <i>ab initio</i>, there has been no judgment, and, consequently, no forfeiture.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p34">
<span class="num">34</span>
<p class="indent">This point must be determined by the known principles of the common law. These were ingrafted into the constitution of New-Jersey, and have never been impaired by the legislature, so far as they apply to the ordinary administration of justice.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p35">
<span class="num">35</span>
<p class="indent">The tribunal erected to execute these laws was an inferior tribunal, proceeding, by force of particular statutes, out of the course of the common law; it was a jurisdiction limited by the statute, both as to the nature of the offence, and the description of persons over whom it should have cognisance. Every thing ought to have been stated in the proceedings which was necessary to give the court jurisdiction, and to justify the judgment of forfeiture. If the jurisdiction does not appear upon the face of the proceedings, the presumption of law is, that the court had not jurisdiction, and so the cause <i>coram non judice</i>. In which case no valid judgment could be rendered.</p>
</div>

The justice issued his warrant to a constable to summon a jury, who take the inquest and return it to the justice, who returns it to the inferior court of common pleas, all of whom are to proceed according to certain forms prescribed by the statute. The inferior court of common pleas has no criminal jurisdiction but what is given by these very statutes relative to treason. And if the proceedings in this case do not show it to be a case within those statutes, the presumption of law is that the case was not within the cognisance of the court.</p>

<p class="indent">However clear the opinion of the court may be, on the first point, in favour of the plaintiff, it will avail her nothing unless she succeeds upon the second. Without repeating, therefore, those arguments which have been so well urged at the bar, to show that the inquisition in this case did not warrant the judgment which was rendered on it, the court will proceed to inquire whether that judgment, while unreversed, does not bar the plaintiff's title.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p68">
<span class="num">68</span>
<p class="indent">The law respecting the proceedings of inferior courts, according to the sense of that term as employed in the English books, has been correctly laid down. The only question is, was the court, in which this judgment was rendered, 'an inferior court,' in that sense of the term?</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p69">
<span class="num">69</span>
<p class="indent">All courts from which an appeal lies are inferior courts in relation to the appellate court before which their judgment may be carried; but they are not therefore inferior courts in the technical sense of those words. They apply to courts of a special and limited jurisdiction, which are erected on such principles that their judgments, taken alone, are entirely disregarded, and the proceedings must show their jurisdiction. The courts of the United States are all of limited jurisdiction, and their proceedings are erroneous, if the jurisdiction be not shown upon them. Judgments rendered in such cases may certainly be reversed, but this court is not prepared to say that they are absolute nullities, which may be totally disregarded.</p>
</div>

Every case of treason, which could arise under the former statutes, is to be finally decided in this court. With respect to treason, then, it is a court of general jurisdiction, so far as respects the property of the accused.</p>

<p class="indent">In the particular case of Grace Kempe, the inquest is found in the form prescribed by law, and by persons authorized to find it. The court was constituted according to law; and, if an offence, punishable by the law, had been in fact committed, the accused was amenable to its jurisdiction, so far as respected her property in the state of New Jersey. The question whether this offence was or was not committed, that is, whether the inquest which is substituted for a verdict on an indictment, did or did not show that the offence had been committed, was a question which the court was competent to decide. The judgment it gave was erroneous, but it is a judgment, and, until reversed, cannot be disregarded.</p>

<p><i>Swann,</i> for the plaintiff in error.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*20</span> <i>E.J. Lee,</i> contra.</p>
<p>MARSHALL, Ch. J. delivered the opinion of the court to the following effect:</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*21</span> The verdict ought to have found the amount of the assets in the hands of the defendant to be administered.</p>
<p>The cases cited to show that the judgment must be for the whole sum, if the verdict find any assets, have been overruled. This is declared by Lord <i>Mansfield,</i> in a case cited in <i>Gwillim's</i> edition of <i>Bdc. Abr.</i> and the law is now well understood to be, that the executor is only liable for the amount of assets found by the jury. In Virginia the law has been so settled. The case cited from 2 Wash. Rep. is precisely in point. The counsel for the defendant in error attempted to show a distinction arising from the difference of form in which the verdicts were rendered. But the two verdicts appear to the court to be precisely alike in substance.</p>
<p>The defendant in error relies on the form of the issue. She contends that as the replication alleges that the defendant has assets more than sufficient to satisfy the debt, he finding of that issue for the plaintiff below in effect finding that the defendant has assets more than sufficient to satisfy the debt; and if so, it is wholly immaterial what the real amount of assets is. But if this were the issue, and the demand were 500 dollars, if the jury should find that the defendant had assets to the amount of 499 dollars, the judgment must be for the defendant.</p>
<p>But the law is not so. An executor is liable for the amount of assets in his hands, and not more.</p>
<p>The issue really is, whether the defendant has <i>any,</i> and what amount of assets in his hands.</p>
<p>Judgment reversed.<sup>[*]</sup></p>

<p><span class="star-pagination">*143</span> <i>E.J. Lee,</i> for the plaintiff in error.</p>
<p><i>Swann,</i> contra.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*148</span> MARSHALL, Ch. J. delivered the opinion of the court as follows:</p>
<p>This case comes on upon two exceptions; one to the opinion of the circuit court given to the jury, and the other to the refusal of that court to give an <span class="star-pagination">*149</span> opinion which was prayed by the counsel for the defendant below.</p>
<p>The declaration contains two counts. One upon the endorsement of a promissory note, and the other for money had and received to the plaintiff's use. The question arising on the first bill of exceptions is, whether the court erred in directing the jury respecting the liability of the defendant below, on the endorsement which was the foundation of the action.</p>
<p>The endorsement was made before the note was written; and it appeared that the body of the note was filed up by Patton. The opinion of the court was, that, if the jury should be satisfied, from the testimony, that Violett endorsed this paper for the purpose of giving Brooke a credit with Patton, and that, upon the faith of the note so drawn and endorsed, Patton did credit Brooke to the amount thereof, the circumstances, that the note was made subsequent to the endorsement, without any consideration from Brooke to Violett, and was filled up by the plaintiff, did not bar the action; and, further, that the said Brooke was to be considered as authorized by the said Violett to make the note to Patton.</p>
<p>This opinion is said to be erroneous; because,</p>
<p>1. The endorsement was made without consideration.</p>
<p>2. It was made on a blank paper.</p>
<p>3. There was no memorandum of the agreement in writing.</p>
<p>In support of the first point, the counsel for the plaintiff in error have cited several cases, intending to prove that an endorsement made without consideration, though it transfers the paper to the endorsee, creates no liability in the endorsor; and that <span class="star-pagination">*150</span> a promise in writing, made without consideration, is void.</p>
<p>So far as respects the immediate parties having knowledge of the fact, and so far as relates to an endorsement under the statute of Virginia, this is correct; but the real question in the cause is, does the testimony prove a sufficient consideration for the promise created by the endorsement? This is not intended to comprehend any writing on which an action of debt is given.</p>
<p>To constitute a consideration it is not absolutely necessary that a benefit should accrue to the person making the promise. It is sufficient that something valuable flows from the person to whom it is made; and that the promise is the inducement to the transaction. In the common case of a letter of credit given by A. to B., the person who, on the faith of that letter, trusts B., is admitted to have his remedy against A., although no benefit accrued to A. as the consideration of his promise. So in the present case, Patton trusted Brooke on the credit of Violett's name, and Violett wrote his name for the purpose of giving Brooke that credit with Patton. It was, in effect, and in intention, a letter of credit. The case shows that this was both the intention and the effect of Violett's giving his name to Brooke. In conscience, and in substance, then, it is a letter of credit, upon which the money, it was intended to secure, was advanced; and although in point of form the transaction takes the shape, and was intended to take the shape, of an endorsement, yet, so far as respects consideration, the endorsement has the full operation of an undertaking in the form of a letter of credit.</p>
<p>It is common in Virginia for two persons to join in a promissory note, the one being the principal and the other the security. Although the whole benefit is received by the principal, this contract has never been considered as a <i>nudum pactum</i> with regard to the security. So far as respects consideration, no <span class="star-pagination">*151</span> difference is perceived in the cases. Violett has signed his name upon this paper, for the purpose of giving Brooke a credit with Patton, and his signature has obtained that credit. The consideration is precisely the same, whether his name be on the back or the face of the paper.</p>
<p>2. The second objection is, that the endorsement preceded the making of the note.</p>
<p>This objection certainly comes with a very bad grace from the mouth of Violett. He endorsed the paper with the intent that the promissory note should be written on the other side; and that he should be considered as the endorsor of that note. It was the shape he intended to give the transaction; and he is now concluded from saying or proving that it was not filled up when he endorsed it. It would be to protect himself from the effect of his promise, by alleging a fraudulent combination between himself and another to obtain money for that other from a third person. The case of <i>Russel</i> and <i>Langstaffe,</i> reported in <i>Douglass,</i> is conclusive on this point.</p>
<p>3. The third objection is, that there was no memorandum of the agreement in writing.</p>
<p>The argument on this point is founded on the idea that the statute of frauds in Virginia is copied literally from the statute of Charles II. This is not the fact. The first section of the act of Virginia differs from the 4th sec. of the stat. of Charles II. in one essential respect. The statute of England enacts that no action shall be brought, in the cases specified, "unless the <i>agreement</i> on which such action shall be brought, or some memorandum or note thereof shall be in writing," &amp;c. The Virginia act enacts that no action shall be brought in the specified cases, "unless the <i>promise</i> or agreement on which such action shall be brought, or some memorandum or note thereof shall be in writing," &amp;c. The reasoning of the judges, in the case in which they have decided that the consideration ought to be <span class="star-pagination">*152</span> in writing, turns upon the word <i>agreement,</i> of which the consideration forms an integral part. This reasoning does not apply to the act of Virginia, in which the word <i>"promise"</i> is introduced.</p>
<p>It was thought proper to notice this difference between the act of parliament, and the act of Virginia, although the opinion of the court is not determined by it. In this case the assignment does express a consideration. It is made for value received.</p>
<p>It is unnecessary to decide in this case, whether the declaration ought to have alleged that the endorsement was made on consideration. With that question the jury had no concern, and the direction of the court was not affected by it. There being no demurrer, it could only occur in arrest of judgment. But on a motion in arrest of judgment, the defendant below could not have availed himself of this error, if it be one, because there are two counts in the declaration, one of which is unquestionably good, and the court cannot perceive on which the verdict was rendered. By the act of jeofails in Virginia, there is no error if any one count will support the judgment.</p>
<p>The second exception is to the refusal of the circuit court to give the opinion, prayed for by the counsel for the defendant below.</p>
<p>When the error alleged is, not that the court has misdirected the jury, but that the court has refused to give a particular opinion, the opinion demanded must be so perfectly stated, that it becomes the duty of the court to give it as stated.</p>
<p>In this case, the opinion required by the counsel consists of two parts. The first is to instruct the jury "that if they shall be satisfied, from the evidence, that Richard Brooke, the maker of the note in this case, had, at the time the note became due, <i>or at any time previous to the commencement of this suit</i> against the defendant, property sufficient to pay <span class="star-pagination">*153</span> the debt claimed," &amp;c. and the plaintiff brought no suit, then this action is not maintainable.</p>
<p>This court conceives that the circuit court ought not to have given this opinion. Had Richard Brooke possessed property before the making of the note, and not afterwards, the opinion, in the terms in which it was required, would have been a direction to find their verdict for the defendant. So if Richard Brooke had been in possession of property for a single day, and had the next day become insolvent, the court was asked to say that, in such a case, the endorsor could only be made liable by suit against the maker. Such a direction, in the opinion of this court, would have been improper.</p>
<p>The second branch of the opinion the circuit court was required to give, is in these words: "Or if the jury shall be satisfied that the said plaintiff and the said Brooke have, since the said note became due, both lived in the county of Fairfax, in Virginia, and have continued to reside in the county of Fairfax until the beginning of the present suit, and the plaintiff hath not brought suit against the said Brooke in Virginia, then the defendant is not liable in this action."</p>
<p>If the plaintiff had sued Brooke elsewhere than in Virginia, or if Brooke had become insolvent previous to the making of the note, and had continued to be so, the opinion of the court, if given as prayed, would have been, that, still, a suit against the maker of the note was necessary to give a right of action against the endorsor</p>
<p>This is not understood to be the law of Virginia. It is understood to be the law, that the maker of the note must be sued, if he is solvent, but his insolvency dispenses with the necessity of suing him. It is not known that any decision of the state courts requires that this insolvency should be proved by taking the oath of an insolvent debtor, nor is it believed that this is the only admissible testimony of <span class="star-pagination">*154</span> the fact of insolvency. Other testimony may be admitted. It would therefore have been proper to leave it to the jury to determine whether it was, at any time, in the power of the plaintiff to have made the money due on this note, or any part of it, from the maker by suit; and their verdict ought to have been regulated by the testimony in this respect.</p>
<p>This opinion was not required.</p>
<p>This court is of opinion that there is no error, and that <i>the judgment is to be affirmed with costs.</i></p>

<center><h1>HODGSON<br/>
v.<br/>
THE MARINE INSURANCE COMPANY OF ALEXANDRIA.</h1></center>
<center><p><b>Supreme Court of United States.</b></p></center>
<center>February 24, 1809.</center>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*104</span> <i>Swann,</i> for the plaintiff in error.</p>
<p><i>E.J. Lee</i> and <i>C. Lee,</i> contra.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*109</span> CUSHING, J. (<i>Marshall, Ch. J. not sitting in the cause</i>) delivered the opinion of the court,<sup>[*]</sup> as follows:</p>
<p>The insurance in this case being general, as well for the parties named as "for all and every other person or persons to whom the vessel did or might appertain," and containing no warranty of neutrality, belligerent as well as American property was covered by it. Some of the parties being described as <i>of Richmond,</i> does not necessarily imply that they all resided there; but if they did, mere residence would not make them citizens; and even then, an express warranty was necessary, if it had been designed to run only a neutral risk. This is an answer to the 7th as well as to the 4th plea; because there can be no undue concealment as to the parties interested, where the terms of the policy are so broad as to preclude the necessity, either of disclosing their names, or of inserting them in the instrument.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*110</span> The eighth plea is also bad. The defendants acknowledge, under seal, to have received a consideration of 17 1-2 <i>per cent.</i> for the insurance they made, which it appears was secured by a note, the amount of which was to be deducted from the sum to be paid for a loss, if any happened. On the face of the instrument, then, a valid consideration, if that be necessary, is stated, and if the note be never paid it cannot vacate the contract, or be relied on as a defence to an action on it. This court knows not why a court of equity has been applied to for an injunction. Its proceedings, therefore, can have no influence on the present suit, for notwithstanding its interposition in the way mentioned in this plea, the defendants cannot be deprived of the right they have reserved of deducting the amount of premium from whatever sum they may have to pay for the loss that has occurred.</p>
<p>Without deciding whether a material misrepresentation, not fraudulent, can be pleaded in avoidance of a sealed instrument, the court thinks there is no fact disclosed by either the fifth or sixth plea, which could vacate an insurance were it only a simple contract. In no part of the 5th plea is the misrepresentation alleged to be material. It is only to be inferred that it had some influence (but to what degree does not appear) in prevailing on the defendants to agree to so high a valuation. It will hardly, however, be insisted, that every over-valuation, however inconsiderable, or however innocently produced, will annul a contract of this nature. It would seem more reasonable, to let mistakes of this kind (if they are to have any operation at all) regulate the extent of recovery, and not deprive the party of his whole indemnity: for if an extravagant valuation be made, an underwriter cannot reasonably ask to be relieved beyond the excess complained of. The allegation that the vessel was worth, when insured, only 3,000 dollars, is also very unimportant, it being nowhere stated that the plaintiff represented her to be worth more, but only proposed that her value in the policy should be agreed <span class="star-pagination">*111</span> at ten thousand dollars. Now although she might not in fact have been worth this sum, it is impossible for the court to say that this difference was produced entirely by the mistake which was made in her age and tonnage. This would be to say that a difference of a year or two in the age, and of fifty or sixty tons in the burden of a vessel, must, in all cases, have the same effect on her value; a conclusion which, on investigation, would be found very incorrect. Nor, if it appeared on trial that her actual worth were no more than 3,000 dollars, would it necessarily avoid the contract, or restrict the damages to that sum; for she may, notwithstanding, have fairly cost her owners the whole amount of her valuation; who, in that case, would have honestly represented her as worth 10,000 dollars.</p>
<p>But a more fatal objection to this plea is, that the misrepresentation relied on is not stated to have been material to the risk of the voyage; and yet the only cases in which policies have been avoided for innocent misrepresentations are those in which the matter disclosed or concealed has affected the risk so as to render it different from the one understood at the time, and on which the premium was calculated.</p>
<p>Most of the remarks on the 5th apply also to the 6th plea: for although it be here alleged that the misrepresentation was material "in regard to the contract of insurance," it should have been stated in what particular, that it might appear whether the <i>risk run</i> were at all affected by it.</p>
<p>An objection is made to the declaration, but not much relied on, that no abandonment is averred to have been made. In covenant such averment cannot be necessary. If it be proved on the trial, it will be sufficient.</p>
<p>The judgment of the circuit court on the 4th, 5th, 7th and 8th pleas must be affirmed with costs; and its judgment in favour of the defendants on the <span class="star-pagination">*112</span> 6th plea reversed; and judgment on that plea be also rendered for the plaintiff.</p>
<p>JOHNSON, J.</p>
<p>The difficulties in this case arise partly from the pleadings, and partly from the case presented by the pleadings.</p>
<p>This policy, having been effected by a corporation under its corporate seal, has been considered as imposing an obligation on the insured to bring <i>covenant</i> instead of <i>assumpsit,</i> as is usual on such contracts.</p>
<p>Thus the defendants have been obliged to plead specially; and the cause comes up on demurrer, which, of course; admits the case as made up on the pleadings.</p>
<p>Whether there is sufficient matter well pleaded why the plaintiff ought not to recover? is therefore the question before us.</p>
<p>I am of opinion that there is. I cannot for a moment suffer the sealing of the policy, or the form of the action, to impose any restriction upon the latitude of defence applicable to the contract of insurance. Such a doctrine would be fatal to every incorporated insurance company. I therefore maintain, that, in the action of covenant on a policy of insurance, every defence may be taken advantage of, in pleading, that could be introduced, in evidence, before a jury. It is an exceedingly inconvenient form of action for trying the merits of questions arising out of this species of contract, and I feel disposed, if possible, to diminish the inevitable difficulties, and the intricate and voluminous pleadings, which must grow out of this form of action, and to admit every facility which the rules of pleading will possibly sanction.</p>
<p>There are eight pleas filed to the present action. On the three first there are issues in fact, and the court below has given judgment on the remaining <span class="star-pagination">*113</span> five. I am disposed to concur in their decisions on each of these several pleas, although, perhaps, on some of them, for reasons not altogether the same with those by which they were influenced; but I shall confine my observations solely to the sixth plea, as that disposes of the case finally, if decided for the defendants, and has been the principal subject of the argument before this court.</p>
<p>The substance of this plea is, that the plaintiff misrepresented the age and tonnage of the vessel, whereby the defendants were induced to insure to a higher amount than they otherwise should; and concludes with averring, that the difference between the true age and tonnage of the vessel, and the represented age and tonnage, <i>was material in regard to the contract of insurance.</i></p>
<p>The plaintiff replies that this misrepresentation was immaterial in regard to the <i>seaworthiness</i> of the vessel; <i>her ability to perform the voyage,</i> and the <i>other risks</i> insured against.</p>
<p>To me it appears that the plea presents the true turning point of the case, and that the replication draws towards questions very different from that which ought to control our decisions.</p>
<p>It is not on the doctrine of <i>seaworthiness</i> that a misrepresentation is held to vitiate the policy, because the insured is always held to guaranty the sufficiency of his vessel to perform the voyage insured. Nor is it an evident and necessary <i>increase</i> of the risk; but it is presenting such false lights to the insurer, as induce him to enter into a contract materially different from that which he supposes he is entering into. It is a rule of law introduced to protect underwriters from those innumerable frauds which are practised upon them in a contract which must of necessity be regulated almost wholly by the information derived from the insured.</p>
<p>I do not lay so much stress upon the misrepresentation <span class="star-pagination">*114</span> with regard to the age of the vessel; for that appertains much to her seaworthiness; but with regard to her size the misrepresentation was so enormous as leaves no doubt upon my mind that had the case been submitted to a jury, the court would have been bound to charge them in favour of the defendants. It had in its nature an immediate tendency to entrap the defendants into one of the most common and most successful snares laid for the unwary underwriter. To make it the interest of the insured rather to sink than to save his vessel. It can very well be conceived that an underwriter may be induced to insure a certain sum upon a certain vessel for a very moderate premium, when no premium would induce him to insure double that amount upon the same bottom. I am aware of a very considerable difficulty arising out of this case, viz. how we are to estimate the degree of misrepresentation with regard to tonnage which shall vitiate a policy? but it is a difficulty arising out of the <i>mode</i> in which we are drawn into a decision on the case, rather than out of the case itself.</p>
<p>If this question had been brought before a jury, the difficulty would have vanished; but shall the party lose the benefit of this defence because the pleadings have assumed such a shape as to force the court into a decision upon the point without a jury? I am of opinion that he ought not, if it can be avoided; an extreme case may be supposed in which the misrepresentation may be very inconsiderable, as of a single ton for instance; but, on the other hand, we may suppose an extreme case of a misrepresentation to the highest possible number of tons burden, say 1,000 tons; will it be said that, in the latter case, the misrepresentation would not avoid the policy?</p>
<p>From these considerations it seems to result that the court is driven to the necessity of deciding this case upon its intrinsic merits, and reserving its opinion upon successive cases as they shall occur. This necessity is forced upon us by the alternative either to decide that no misrepresentation, however gross, <span class="star-pagination">*115</span> of the size of the vessel will avoid a policy, or that any misrepresentation, however minute, will have that effect. It is to be hoped, in the mean time, that some statutory provision may be made, which will relieve the court from a similar embarrassment.</p>
<p>Judgment reversed.</p>

<p class="parties">THE UNITED STATES<br/>v.<br/>JOHN ARTHUR AND ROBERT PATTERSON.</p>
<p class="date">February Term, 1809</p>
<div class="prelims">
<p class="indent">ERROR to the Kentucky district court of the United States, in an action of debt on a bond for 6,000 dollars.</p>
<p class="indent">The <i>capias ad respondendum</i> issued on the 28th of June, 1803, returnable to the first Monday of July in the same year, and was served on the 30th of June.</p>
<p class="indent">The declaration was in the usual form of an action of debt for the penalty of the bond with a <i>profert</i>, but without setting forth its condition or any breach thereof.</p>
<p class="indent">The defendants, without praying <i>oyer</i>, pleaded as follows: 'And the defendants, by their attorneys, come and defend the wrong and injury when and where, &amp;c. and for plea say they have well and truly kept and performed, and have faithfully executed and discharged, all and singular the duties enjoined on them by the laws of the United States, and the conditions in the writing obligatory in the declaration mentioned, and this they are ready to verify,' &amp; c.</p>
<p class="indent">The plaintiffs replied, that they ought not to be barred, &amp;c. because they say 'that the said defendants have not well and truly kept the several conditions in the said writing obligatory, as they in pleading have alleged, but have broken the same in this, to wit, that the said John Arthur, although duly appointed to the office of collector of the revenue for the first division of the first survey of the district of Ohio, as stated in the said condition, had not, at the time of executing the said writing obligatory, executed and discharged, nor after the execution thereof, did he continue to execute and discharge faithfully all the duties of said office; and <i>also failed</i> to settle his accounts with the <i>proper officer</i> according to law for more than six months previous to the institution of this suit, and <i>also failed</i> to pay over to the <i>proper officer</i> the duties which <i>were collected, or the duties which by law, and the accounts rendered by the said John, he was bound to collect and pay over; and is in arrear</i> to the said United States in the sum of sixteen thousand, one hundred and eighty one dollars and fifteen cents, due from and unpaid by him in his said office of collector as aforesaid; and this the said plaintiffs <i>pray may be inquired of by the country</i>.'</p>
<p class="indent">To this replication the defendants demurred specially, 'Because this suit is prosecuted under the 14th section of the act of congress passed in the month of July, 1798, <i>c.</i> 88. entitled, 'An act to regulate and fix the compensation of the officers employed in collecting the internal revenues of the United States, and to ensure more effectually the settlement of their accounts,' which section is in the following words, to wit: 'The bond of any supervisor or other officer of the revenue, who shall neglect or refuse, for more than six months, to make up and render to the proper officer, his accounts of all duties collected or secured, pursuant to such forms and regulations as have been, or shall be, prescribed, according to law, or to verify such accounts on oath or affirmation, if thereto required, or to pay over the moneys which shall have been collected, shall be deemed forfeited, and judgment thereon shall and may be taken at the return term on motion, to be made in open court, by the attorney of the United States, unless sufficient cause to the contrary be shown to, and allowed by, the court; provided always, that the writ or process in such case shall have been executed at least fourteen days before the return day thereof;'</p>
<p class="indent">'And the plaintiffs, in assigning the breach in the following words, to wit, 'And also failed to pay over to the proper officer the duties which were collected, or the duties which by law, and by the accounts rendered by the said John, he was bound to collect and pay over,' have assigned the said breach neither within the letter nor the meaning of the said section of the said act of congress; but the same is calculated to charge the said defendants with the amount of the duties due within the said first division of the first survey of the district of Ohio, whether the same is collected or secured, or not, or whether they could or might have been collected or not.'</p>
<p class="indent">This demurrer being joined, the judgment of the court below was in favour of the defendants; and the United States brought their writ of error.</p>
<p class="indent"><i>Rodney</i>, Attorney-General, for the United States.</p>
<p class="indent">Whether the replication be good, or not, the defendants have committed the first error in pleading, and therefore the judgment of the court below ought to have been against them. The plea is bad for want of oyer of the bond, and of the condition, the performance of which is pleaded; as in the case of <i>Wallace</i> v. <i>The Duchess of Cumberland</i>, 4 <i>Term Rep.</i> 370. where the defendant, after praying oyer of the bond and condition, omitted to set forth the <i>recital</i> which preceded the condition; and the court said that the plaintiff might have signed judgment <i>as for want of a plea</i>.</p>
<p class="indent">But the replication is good in substance; and if it contain more than is necessary, the surplusage will not vitiate it. 4 <i>Dal.</i> 440. A replication may be bad in part, but good upon the whole. This replication states matter sufficient to entitle the plaintiffs to maintain an action upon the bond; and even if it afterwards state something which is inaccurate, it will not vitiate the whole. 3 <i>Term Rep.</i> 376. <i>Duffield</i> v. <i>Scott. Buller's</i> opinion. The breach need not be assigned in the words of the condition. It is sufficient if a substantial breach be set forth. <i>Doug.</i> 367. <i>Esp. N. P.</i> 209.</p>
<p class="indent">A demurrer admits all matters of fact although <i>informally</i> pleaded, if the right of the matter sufficiently appears. 1 <i>Tidd's Prac.</i> 649. (<i>London edit.) Hob.</i> 233.</p>
<p class="indent">The action is not necessarily brought under the 14th section of the act of July, 1798. That section does not prevent the United States from bringing actions in any other manner.</p>
<p class="indent"><i>Pope</i> contra.</p>
<p class="indent">The first error is in the declaration. No action can be maintained upon an official bond, until the condition be broken; and unless the declaration show the condition to be broken, it shows to cause of action in the United States. The act of congress only authorizes a suit to be brought upon such a bond when the obligor has failed in his official duty, and such failure is a part of the plaintiff's title to sue.</p>
<p class="indent">In the case of <i>Stoddert</i> v. <i>M'Clanaghan</i>, in the court of appeals of Kentucky, <i>Sneed's Cases</i>, 359. the court said, as the plaintiff could only sue in his own name, upon a bond given to the governor, by virtue of the act of assembly which gives a right of action upon such a bond to a <i>person injured</i>, the plaintiff ought in his declaration to have averred himself to be a person injured; otherwise he does not show a title in <i>himself</i> to sue.</p>
<p class="indent">LIVINGSTON, J. How does it appear that this is an official bond, and not a bond for a debt simply?</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p1">
<span class="num">1</span>

<div class="num" id="p3">

<p class="indent">This case is not like that of <i>Stoddert and M'Clanaghan</i>. In that case the name of the plaintiff did not appear in the bond, and the only fact which could give him a right to sue upon the bond was that he was a person <i>injured</i>. But in the present case the plaintiffs are the obligees of the bond, and the defendants under their hands and seals have acknowledged themselves to stand indebted to the plaintiffs in the amount of the penalty of the bond. If they would take advantage of the condition of the bond they must show it.</p>

<p class="parties">THE MARINE INSURANCE COMPANY OF ALEXANDRIA<br/>v.<br/>JAMES YOUNG.</p>
<p class="date">February Term, 1809</p>
<div class="prelims">
<p class="indent">ERROR to the circuit court of the district of Columbia, sitting at Alexandria, in an action of covenant, brought by the defendant in error upon a policy of insurance under the corporate seal of the plaintiffs in error.</p>
<p class="indent">The point in issue, in the court below, was, whether the insured, on the 11th of December, 1800, when he wrote his order for insurance, had notice of a storm which happened at Jamaica, on the 2d of November, 1800.</p>
<p class="indent">Part of the evidence offered to the jury was the deposition of David Young, a witness examined on behalf of the plaintiffs in error. Upon his cross-examination by the defendant in error, at the time of the taking of the deposition, he was asked this question, viz. 'On what day in December did you inform the plaintiff that there had been a gale of wind in Jamaica?' To which it was stated in the deposition that he answered, 'that on the 13th of December, 1800, he had informed the plaintiff (below) that there had been a strong northern in Jamaica; the circumstance which induced him to mention this, was in consequence of a very heavy gale having happened the day before, and the brig Mary, being then in Hampton Roads, which produced this remark, that he had a blowing voyage out, being compelled to throw over his guns, and that the aforesaid northern had happened when he was in St. Anne's.'</p>
<p class="indent">After the jury had retired to consider of their verdict, they sent a written paper to the judges, requesting to be instructed by the court, whether the above answer of David Young would admit of any other reasonable or legal construction, than that the 13th of December, 1800, was the <i>first</i> information given by him to the plaintiff below of the storm of the 2d of November.</p>
<p class="indent">But the court refused to give any opinion to the jury upon the construction of the answer of David Young, unless with the assent of both parties; and the counsel for the plaintiffs in error refused to assent, and took a bill of exceptions to the refusal of the court to instruct the jury, without the consent of <i>both</i> parties.</p>
<p class="indent">The jury found a verdict for the defendant in error; and before judgment, the plaintiffs in error moved the court for a new trial, upon the ground that the verdict was contrary to evidence.</p>
<p class="indent">The court having refused to grant a new trial, the counsel for the plaintiffs in error tendered a bill of exceptions, containing what they supposed to be a correct statement of all the evidence offered on the trial, consisting of depositions, and other papers, together with <i>viva voce</i> testimony, the substance of which they stated they had taken from their notes. But the court refused to seal the bill of exceptions, unless the counsel for the plaintiff below would agree to a statement of the evidence, the court not being satisfied that the bill of exceptions stated all the evidence offered at the trial. To this refusal of the court to seal the bill of exceptions, the counsel for the plaintiffs in error tendered another bill of exceptions, which the judges sealed.</p>
<p class="indent"><i>C. Lee</i> and <i>E. J. Lee</i>, for the plaintiffs in error, contended.</p>
<p class="indent">1. That the court was bound to give an opinion to the jury, upon the meaning of the witness's answer, and ought to have instructed the jury that the answer did not necessarily import that the 13th of December, 1800, was the <i>first time</i> that the witness mentioned to the defendant in error the storm of the 2d of November; and that if he had given him the information before that day, his answer was so vague that he could not have been convicted of perjury.</p>
<p class="indent">2. That the court below ought to have signed the bill of exceptions to their refusal to grant a new trial.</p>
<p class="indent">3. That the court ought to have granted a new trial, because the verdict was contrary to evidence; and,</p>
<p class="indent">4. That this court, if they believe the evidence is substantially stated in the rejected bill of exceptions, ought to order a new trial.</p>
<p class="indent">To support these points, they cited <i>Co. Litt.</i> 226. b. 295. b. 155. b. <i>Harg. note</i>. 1 <i>Wash.</i> 389. 2 <i>Wash.</i> 275. 9 <i>Co.</i> 12. b. 13. a. 3 <i>Cranch</i>, 298. 3 <i>N. Y. Term Rep.</i> 49. 2 <i>N. Y. Term Rep.</i> 330. <i>Bac. Abr.</i> 269. <i>Hen. &amp; Munf. Rep.</i> 386. 1 <i>Wash.</i> 79. 1 <i>Cranch</i>, 110. 2 <i>Cranch</i>, 126. <i>Laws U. S. vol.</i> 1. <i>p.</i> 60. Â§ 17. 3 <i>Bl. Com.</i> 375.</p>
<p class="indent"><i>Swann</i>, contra.</p>
<p class="indent">A deposition is merely parol testimony, and the jury is the proper tribunal to judge of the meaning of a witness.</p>
<p class="indent">If the witness was not sufficiently explicit, the counsel for the plaintiffs in error, who were present at the examination, ought to have made the witness explain himself more fully. 2 <i>Term Rep.</i> 760. <i>Lloyd</i> v. <i>Maund</i>.</p>
<p class="indent">The refusal to grant a new trial, upon the ground that the verdict was against evidence, is not error.</p>
<p class="indent">A motion for a new trial on that ground is in the nature of a writ of error <i>coram vobis</i> for error in fact.</p>
<p class="indent"><i>C. Lee</i> and <i>E. J. Lee</i>, in reply.</p>
<p class="indent">In the case of <i>Lloyd</i> v. <i>Maund</i>, the court was not called upon to say what was the construction of the letter.</p>
<p class="indent">This court is a substitute for the court of appeals of Virginia, as to the cases from Alexandria, and ought to decide as that court would decide in Virginia. By the practice of that state, it is error to refuse a new trial, if a new trial ought to have been granted. The refusal is a part of the proceedings, and appears upon the record.</p>
<p class="indent">In the case of <i>Clarke</i> v. <i>Russel</i>, 3 <i>Dal.</i> 415. the court undertook to construe and expound a letter.</p>
<p class="indent">LIVINGSTON, J. Can this court reverse for error in fact? Suppose we should be of opinion that the court below ought to have granted a new trial, is it not an error <i>in fact?</i></p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p1">
<span class="num">1</span>
<p class="indent">I have another doubt. Whether it be the ground of a writ of error, if a judge gives or refuses to give an opinion on matter of fact.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p2">
<span class="num">2</span>

<center><p><b>Supreme Court of United States.</b></p></center>
<center>March 1, 1809.</center>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*235</span> <i>P.B. Key</i> and <i>Rowan,</i> for the complainants, (the plaintiffs in error.)</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*236</span> <i>Pope</i> and <i>Swann,</i> contra.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*241</span> MARSHALL, Ch. J. delivered the opinion of the court.</p>
<p>In this case the title of both parties originates in surveys made by the surveyor of Fincastle county, previous to the passage of the land law of Virginia. Both surveys were made on military warrants issued under the proclamation of 1763. The survey under which the plaintiffs claim, being prior in point of time, they have the first equitable title, and must prevail, unless the objections made to that survey be valid, or unless their equity is defeated by the circumstances of the case.</p>
<p>Several objections have been made to the survey, each of which will be considered.</p>
<p>1. It is said that the warrant was not in possession of the principal surveyor when the survey was made.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*242</span> The answer given to this objection is conclusive. The warrant is an authority to, and an injunction on, the surveyor to lay off 2,000 acres of vacant land which had not been surveyed by order of council, and patented subsequent to the proclamation. Whether acts under this authority are valid or void, if the authority itself be not in possession of the officer, is perfectly unimportant in this case; because the court considers the certificate of the surveyor as sufficient evidence that the warrant was in his possession, if, in point of law, it was necessary that it should be lodged in the office. That certificate is in the usual form, and states the survey to have been made by virtue of the governor's warrant, and agreeably to his majesty's royal proclamation.</p>
<p>2. The second objection is, that the survey does not appear to have been recorded within two months after it was made.</p>
<p>The opinion, that this omission on the part of the surveyor avoids the title which accrued under the survey, is founded on the 6th section of an act passed in the year 1748, entitled, "An act directing the duty of surveyors of land." In prescribing this duty the law, among other things, enjoins the surveyor "to enter, or cause to be entered, in a book well bound, to be ordered and provided by the court of his county, a true, correct and fair copy and plat of every survey by him made during his continuance in office, within two months after making the same."</p>
<p>This section is merely directory to the surveyor. It does not make the validity of the survey dependent on its being recorded, nor does it give the proprietor any right to control the conduct of the surveyor in this respect. His title, where it can commence without an entry, begins with the survey; and it would be unreasonable to deprive him of that title by the subsequent neglect of an officer, not appointed by himself, in not performing an act which the law does not pronounce necessary to his title, <span class="star-pagination">*243</span> the performance of which he has not the means of coercing.</p>
<p>If the omission to record the survey in two months would avoid it, then the omission of any other act enjoined by the same section would equally avoid it. The surveyor is directed to see the land "plainly bounded by natural bounds, or marked trees." Has his conforming to this direction ever been inquired into, in a contest respecting the validity of a survey? Would any gentleman of the bar contend that the land was not plainly bounded, and that, for this reason, a survey actually made was void? He is, within five months, to deliver to his employer a plat and certificate. Suppose six months should elapse before he complies with this duty, is the survey void? He is to certify the true quantity of land contained in the survey. Would the gentlemen from Kentucky be willing to adopt it as a principle that every survey expressing a quantity more or less than the true quantity is absolutely void? He is to state the water-courses, and also the plantations next adjoining. Should any one of these be omitted, is the survey void? He is to return a list of surveys in the month of June annually to the clerk's office. Should he fail in this, are the surveys void? On these points it is impossible seriously to insist; and the court can perceive no distinction between them. They are all merely directory to the officer, and none of them affect a title which commenced before they are to be performed. He is subjected to a penalty for failing in any one of these duties, but his performing or omitting them is unimportant to the rights of those for whom surveys have been made.</p>
<p>3. The third objection is of more weight. It is, that the survey must be certified by the person who made it, and can be authenticated in no other manner.</p>
<p>That, in point of fact, this survey was certified as made, is not doubted. But it is said that the <span class="star-pagination">*244</span> plat and certificate want those appropriate forms which alone the law will receive as evidence of their verity.</p>
<p>The survey was made by Hancock Taylor, assistant surveyor of Fincastle county, from whose field-notes, the plat and certificate were made out by his principal, who also signed them. Hancock Taylor was prevented from performing this duty by a mortal wound received from the Indians. It is understood to be usual for the assistant, where surveys are actually made by him, to sign the plat and certificate, which are also signed by his principal.</p>
<p>The 46th section of the act, "for settling the titles and bounds of lands, and for preventing unlawful hunting and ranging," enacts, "that every survey of lands <i>intended to be patented</i> shall be made and returned by a sworn surveyor duly commissioned for that purpose."</p>
<p>Let us inquire whether, under this section, the plat and certificate must be made out by the person who made the survey, and whether a survey actually made by an assistant must be platted and certified by him.</p>
<p>It may be of some importance, in the construction of this section, to inquire whether the return alluded to is to the office of the principal surveyor, or to the land-office, out of which the patent is to issue.</p>
<p>In construing this section, the accompanying sections afford us no aid. But the general object of the act, and the allusion to <i>patenting</i> which is made in the section, would lead to the opinion that returns to the land-office were in contemplation of the legislature. If we examine the laws generally, we shall find that most usually the word "surveyor" is applied to the principal, and where the law alludes to the assistant, he is designated by the term "assistant surveyor." If the return directed by this section is to be made to the land-office, for the purpose <span class="star-pagination">*245</span> of obtaining a patent, then the principal surveyor is the person who is to certify it, and a survey actually run by himself, or by his assistant, is to be considered, in law, as a survey made by himself. It is believed to be most usual for the plat and certificate returned to the land-office, to be signed by the principal and by his assistant; but this section seems not to require both. The signature of the assistant is the justification to the principal for recording and certifying the survey, and is the best testimony that it has been made; but the law does not require, in terms, that where that best testimony is unattainable, no other shall be received. So far as the section which has been recited goes, the signature of the principal surveyor sufficiently authenticated this plat and that a patent has issued upon it, is proof that such was the opinion entertained in the land-office. A patent certainly does not issue of course, unless the papers on which it issues be regular. A plat not legally authenticated is no plat, and the register cannot justify issuing a patent on it.</p>
<p>This consideration certainly deserves some weight: but if the court inspect this section, it seems, in fair construction, to require only the signature of the principal surveyor, who, consequently, judges, in the first instance, of the testimony which will enable him to certify a survey. If the signature of the assistant can be dispensed with, then other testimony than his signature may authorize the principal to certify a survey; and if, in any possible case, other testimony can be deemed competent, it surely may in this.</p>
<p>If the return directed by this section be understood to be a return to the office of the principal surveyor, it is necessary to inquire what it is that the section exacts. It is, that the "survey shall be made and returned by a sworn surveyor," not that the plat shall be made out and certified to the principal by the assistant who run the lines. The courses and distances contained in the field-book of the assistant, represent to the principal as correctly <span class="star-pagination">*246</span> and as intelligibly the survey actually made, as the plat and certificate could do. From these data he is as capable of placing on his record-book a correct plat, and of returning that plat to the land-office, as if the lines of the survey had been placed on paper by the assistant himself. It would seem reasonable, therefore, even on this construction of the section, in the actual case where death has disabled the assistant from platting his works, to consider the law as satisfied by the delivery of those works to the principal surveyor.</p>
<p>The "act directing the duty of surveyors of land" does not appear to this court to contain any provisions which are opposed to the construction here made of the preceding act of the same session. The 6th section of that act, which has been particularly referred to by counsel, prescribes the duty of surveyors, but contains no direction respecting the signature of plats and certificates, except this: "Every surveyor making a survey of land shall see the same plainly bounded by natural bounds, or marked trees, and within five months after survey, shall deliver to his employer a plat and certificate thereof."</p>
<p>It has never been understood that this plat and certificate may not be delivered by the principal; and other parts of this section show that the duties enjoined, are some of them to be performed by the principal. The section proceeds to say, "and shall also enter, or cause to be entered, in a book well bound, to be provided by the court of <i>his</i> county, a true, correct and fair copy and plat of every survey by <i>him</i> made." Now this book is the book of the principal. It is, of course, his duty to superintend the entries in it. They are to be "of the surveys by <i>him</i> made." The survey made by the assistant, is, then, to be entered by the principal as a survey by <i>him</i> made. He is also to return annually a list of the surveys by <i>him</i> made, to the county court clerk's office. This return is made by the principal. Certainly the list must include all the surveys made by <span class="star-pagination">*247</span> his assistants. They also are considered as made by him. Upon a view of the whole section, the court perceives nothing in it which renders it improper for the principal to plat and certify a survey made by his assistant whose field-notes are returned complete to him, and who has been disabled by death from making the plat himself.</p>
<p>This construction is very much strengthened by the terms of the act of 1779. That act declares "that all surveys of waste and unappropriated land made upon any of the western waters before the 1st day of January, 1778," "by any <i>county surveyor,</i> commissioned by the masters of William and Mary college, acting in conformity to the laws and rules of government then in force, and founded either upon charter," &amp;c. "or upon any warrant from the governor for the time being, for military service, in virtue of a proclamation either from the king of Great Britain, or any former governor of Virginia, shall be and are hereby declared good and valid; but that all surveys of waste and unpatented lands made <i>by any other person,</i> or upon any other pretence whatsoever, shall be and are hereby declared null and void."</p>
<p>Notwithstanding this declaration, we find that patents have actually issued, under which both parties in this cause claim, on surveys made not by the county surveyor in person, but by his assistant. It is perfectly well known that a great proportion of the surveys recognised by this act have been really executed by assistant surveyors. Upon what principle of construction are they brought within the act? Clearly upon this. The law, so far as respects the validity of the survey, considers the act of the deputy as the act of his principal. A survey made by an assistant is, in law language, made by the principal. And if this idea be taken up on so material a clause as that which confirms or invalidates every survey previously made, and which is expressed in terms much more explicit and decisive than any of the clauses in the preceding acts, must <span class="star-pagination">*248</span> not the idea be carried throughout? Must not the survey, in all cases, be considered in a legal point of view as made by the principal through the agency of his deputy, and must not this principal be kept in view in construing the laws upon the subject.</p>
<p>This survey, then, is, in law language, made by William Preston. It is confirmed as a survey made by him. The law recognises it as his survey. Assuredly, then, his certificate may authenticate it.</p>
<p>The act proceeds to say that "all and every person or persons, his, her or their heirs, claiming lands upon any of the before recited rights, and under surveys made as herein before mentioned, (that is, by a county surveyor,) against which no caveat shall have been legally entered, shall, upon the plats and certificates of such surveys being returned into the land-office, together with the rights, &amp;c. upon which they were respectively founded, be entitled to a grant for the same."</p>
<p>To the court, it seems clear that the law authorizes a plat and certificate of survey from the person whom it contemplates as the maker of that survey; that is, from the county surveyor. The formal requisites of the law are complied with by a plat and certificate under his signature. He has given it, in this case, on testimony, which the court deems as full and complete as even the plat certified by the assistant who made the survey would have been.</p>
<p>These are the objections which have been made to the survey under which the plaintiffs claim. After bestowing on them the utmost attention, the court is decidedly of opinion, that the survey of M`Donald was and ought to be considered as a good and valid survey.</p>
<p>4. The 4th objection to the plaintiff's claim is founded on their negligence.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*249</span> At law, this objection is clearly of no validity. The proviso to that section of the act of 1779, which has been considered, declares that such surveys shall be returned to the land-office within twelve months after the expiration of that session of assembly, or should become void. The time for returning them, however, was prolonged until this patent issued. Consequently, a <i>caveat</i> to prevent the emanation of the patent, because the survey was not returned in time, could not have been maintained. If the survey of M`Donald came within the law, the circumstance, that the subsequent survey of Sumner was made without notice in fact, cannot alter the case. His warrant only authorized him to acquire vacant land, and he took upon himself to find lands of that description. The principle, <i>caveat emptor,</i> is directly applicable.</p>
<p>5. The 5th objection made by the defendant is, that the patent of the plaintiffs contains surplus land. The warrant, it is said, was an authority to survey only 2,000 acres, and, for the surplus, the survey was made without authority.</p>
<p>It is a fact of universal notoriety in Virginia not only that the old military surveys, but that the old patents of that country generally contain a greater quantity of land than the patents call for. The ancient law of Virginia notices this fact, and provides for the case. It prescribes the manner in which this surplus may be acquired by other persons; and it is worthy of notice that the patentee must himself reject the surplus before it can be acquired by another, and, after having so rejected it, he has the election to allot it in such part of his patent as he pleases.</p>
<p>It is contended, however, that although a grant containing surplus land might give a legal right to such surplus yet a survey could not be carried into grant so far as such surplus appeared upon a <i>caveat.</i></p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*250</span> On this subject we find no act of Virginia under the regal government. At that time the governor and council constituted a branch of the legislature and the general court of the colony. They also held a distinct court in the council chamber for the trial of <i>caveats,</i> their decisions on which were regulated by rules established by themselves. These rules, it is believed, are lost; and it is also believed that the means of ascertaining satisfactorily what they were, are no longer attainable. The land law of 1779 was framed by men who understood them, and it is not unreasonable to suppose that, in drawing that law, some respect was paid to them. That law gives a <i>caveat</i> against a survey not returned to the land-office within twelve months after it is made, or whose breadth shall not be one third of its length, but gives no <i>caveat</i> on account of surplus land contained in a survey, nor does it indicate the idea that, on a survey containing such surplus, a <i>caveat</i> could not be supported. If such survey is not absolutely void for the whole, the difficulty of assigning the exact quantity is sufficient to have induced legislative regulation, had it been contemplated as the subject of a <i>caveat.</i> It would seem that, for security in this respect, the government trusted to the oaths prescribed for surveyors and chain carriers. It is also worthy of remark, that the law of 1779 superadds to the restrictions formerly imposed on taking up surplus lands contained in any patent, that it can only be done during the life of the original patentee, and before any alienation has been made.</p>
<p>It is also to be observed, that the act of 1779 confirms this survey, and it is understood that no previous entry was deemed necessary to its validity. The entries made on treasury warrants are most frequently in such terms that a survey for a greater quantity of land might be considered as being so far contrary to location, and might be restrained by the location; but, where there is no entry, the difficulty of restraining the survey is much increased, because there exists no standard by which to reduce it. There is, indeed, a standard as to quantity, but <span class="star-pagination">*251</span> not as to form and place. The survey is an appropriation of a certain quantity of land by metes and bounds, plainly marked by an officer appointed by the government for that purpose, and it would seem that the government receives his plat and certificate as full evidence of the correctness of the survey. This being the case, it is admitted by the government to be an appropriation of the land it covers, and it is difficult to discern a rule by which the survey could be reduced on a <i>caveat</i> by the owner of an interfering survey, unless the entry on which it was made was in such terms that the excess might be considered as surveyed contrary to location. For to every and to each part of the land surveyed, its owner has an equal right.</p>
<p>Whatever rules might have been established in the tribunal having jurisdiction of the subject, under the regal government, the <i>caveat</i> in this cause, had one been entered, must have been regulated by the act of 1779. That act gives validity to both surveys; and although it directs <i>caveats</i> depending in the council chamber, at the commencement of the revolution, to be transferred to the general court, and to be tried by the rules which governed when they were entered, it subjects future <i>caveats</i> to the law then introduced. Under this law, as has already been stated, the court can perceive but one principle on which a survey can be reduced on a <i>caveat,</i> and that principle is inapplicable to this case.</p>
<p>In conformity with this opinion is that of the judges of Kentucky. Not a case exists, so far as the court is informed, in which, on a <i>caveat,</i> the quantity of land in the survey of plaintiff or defendant has been considered as affecting the title, upon the single principle of surplus. Yet the fact must have often occurred. And in the case of Beckly <i>v.</i> Bryan and Ransdale, the contrary principle is expressly laid down. In that cause the court said, "It is proper to premise that there is but one species of cases in which any court of justice is authorized by our land law to devest the owner of a survey <span class="star-pagination">*252</span> of the surplus included within its boundaries; namely, where the survey was made posterior to an entry made by another person on the same land; and to do more would be unequal, and unjust, inasmuch as a survey which is too small cannot be enlarged.</p>
<p>This position, it is true, was laid down in a contest between a military survey and a patent on a treasury warrant. But it is laid down in terms equally applicable to a contest between two military surveys; and the court does not understand that the law has ever been otherwise understood in Kentucky.</p>
<p>The opinions delivered by the judges of appeals of Virginia in the case of <i>Johnson</i> v. <i>Buffington,</i> 2 <i>Wash.</i> 116. would incline this court very much to the opinion that the same rule prevailed in the council chamber before the revolution. In that case, under a warrant from Lord Fairfax for 300 acres of land, 450 acres had been surveyed, and the excess appeared on the plat. This survey had lain in the office many years, and was clearly forfeitable; but Lord Fairfax had not taken advantage of the forfeiture. After his death a patent issued on a subsequent entry and survey, and the patentee was decreed to convey to the person claiming under the prior entry. In delivering his opinion Judge Fleming said, "The first objection made by the counsel for the appellant is, that the survey does not pursue the warrant; but I think there is no weight in this, as the variance is only in the quantity. If the land had been <i>imperfectly</i> described, it might have been fatal."</p>
<p>Judge Carrington said, "He did not consider the variance between the warrant and survey, as to the quantity, as being of any consequence."</p>
<p>The President, who had been an eminent practitioner in the council chamber, said, "He felt no <span class="star-pagination">*253</span> difficulty about the variance in the quantity of the land."</p>
<p>The rules established by Lord Fairfax were known to conform to those of the crown, and the declarations of the judges in this case, all of whom were acquainted, in some degree, with the usages under the regal government, make a strong impression on this court in favour of the opinion that, in the council chamber, the law was understood to be, that excess in the survey was not to be regarded.</p>
<p>The law of this case, then, so far as respects the state of title previous to the emanation of either grant, appears to be with the first survey. It remains to inquire whether a court of equity will relieve against the legal title acquired by the first grant.</p>
<p>The principle on which relief is granted is, that the patent, which is the consummation of title, does, in equity, relate to the inception of title; and, therefore, in a court of equity, the person who has first appropriated the land in contest has the best title, unless his equity is impaired by the circumstances of the case.</p>
<p>In this cause, the first patentee is said to be a purchaser without notice. But, for the reasons assigned in a former part of this opinion, the court does not consider him as clothed with that character. His warrant authorizes him to survey waste and unappropriated lands, and he undertakes himself to find lands of that description. The government acts entirely on his information; and the terms of his grant are, that the lands were waste and unappropriated. It is not for him to say that he had misinformed the government, and had surveyed appropriated instead of vacant lands, and had thereby entitled himself to be considered as a purchaser without notice.</p>
<p>Neither does the court conceive that the plaintiffs <span class="star-pagination">*254</span> have forfeited their right to come into a court of equity, by their negligence.</p>
<p>In the case of 1 <i>Wash.</i> 116. the prior right of the plaintiff had been absolutely forfeited, so that the defendant had the first title both in equity and law, and the plaintiff's bill was dismissed because he failed to prove the fraud which he alleged, and which was, in that case, necessary to give the court jurisdiction.</p>
<p>In the case of Picket and Dowdale, and of Currie and Burns, there were both forfeiture and abandonment.</p>
<p>In the case of <i>Johnson and Bronw,</i> 3 <i>Call,</i> 259. more than sufficient time had elapsed between the entry and survey of the plaintiff to produce a forfeiture; but, by the old law, notice was to be given by the surveyor before a forfeiture could take place, and this fact was not proved. During forty years this entry had been totally neglected; and the court was of opinion that, after such a lapse of time, the fact of notice by the surveyor might be presumed. This case then also turned on the principle of forfeiture. There were, besides, a great many circumstances in Johnson's title which gave a strong bias to the judgment of the court.</p>
<p>The difference between the case under consideration, and those cited is apparent. But the case of Johnson <i>v.</i> Buffington was much stronger than this. The prior survey was actually forfeitable, but had not been forfeited; and in that case, after a much longer time than exists in the present, a court of equity supported it against the eldest grant.</p>
<p>The general principles which have been relied on, in this branch of the argument, cannot be considered as applicable to a case in which the act, which constitutes the foundation of the charge of negligence, was performed within the time allowed by statute <span class="star-pagination">*255</span> for its performance. The circumstances, which excused the owners of military surveys for not returning them, were before the legislature and have been declared, by law, to be sufficient.</p>
<p>But it is contended that the plaintiffs can have no equity beyond the 2,000 acres contained in the warrant on which M`Donald's survey was made.</p>
<p>If this court is to consider itself as merely substituted for a court of law, with no other difference than the power of going beyond the patent, this question is already decided. But, in the case of <i>Bodley and Hughes</i> v. <i>Taylor,</i> an opinion was indicated that its jurisdiction, not being given by statute, but assumed by itself, must be exercised upon the known principles of equity. This opinion is still though perfectly correct in itself. Its application to particular cases, and indeed its being considered as a rule of decision on Kentucky titles, will depend very much on the decisions of that country. For, in questions respecting title to real estate especially, the same rule ought certainly to prevail in both courts.</p>
<p>But, in its equity, this case differs essentially from Bodley and Hughes v. Taylor. In that case, Taylor had the eldest entry as well as the eldest patent. In this, the eldest equitable right is with him who holds the eldest<sup>[*]</sup> grant. In that case, the variance between the entry and survey of the elder right is established by a set of rules growing out of expositions subsequent to the survey. In this, the eldest grant is founded on a survey made on land which, in point of fact, was previously appropriated. But, which is of great importance, in that case, the terms of the subsequent location prove that the locator considered himself as comprehending Taylor's previous entry within his location, and, consequently, did not suppose so much of the land covered by his entry as being then subject to appropriation. <span class="star-pagination">*256</span> He either did not mean to acquire the land within Taylor's entry, or he is to be considered as a man watching for the accidental mistakes of others, and preparing to take advantage of them. What is gained at law by a person of this description, equity will not take from him; but it does not follow that equity will aid his views, and give more than the law gives him, by allowing him to hold what he has legally gained, while he demands what is legally lost.</p>
<p>In this case, M. Donald supposed himself to be appropriating, and in fact was appropriating, land to which no other had, at the time, any pretensions.</p>
<p>In addition to these strong differences, in equity, between the two cases, no decision of Kentucky was shown to the court, which was applicable to the case of Bodley and Hughes <i>v.</i> Taylor. But the case of Beckly <i>v.</i> Bryan and Rausdale is conceived to be an authority in point for this case. The decision of the court of appeals of Virginia, in the case of Buffington and Johnson is also considered as expressly in point, and is to be respected, because both these surveys were made while the country in which they were made formed a part of Virginia.</p>
<p>It is though not absolutely unimportant, in a court of equity, that one of the circumstances has occurred, which, at law, rescues the surplus land in M`Donald's patent from the possibility of being acquired by any other person. An alienation has taken place. The decree, therefore, of the court for the district of Kentucky, is to be reversed, and the defendant must be decreed to release to the plaintiffs, respectively, the lands within Sumner's patent which lie within the lines of the land conveyed by M`Donald's heirs to them respectively.</p>

<p class="parties">YEATON AND OTHERS, CLAIMANTS OF THE SCHOONER GENERAL<br/>PINKNEY AND CARGO,<br/>v.<br/>THE UNITED STATES.</p>
<p class="date">February Term, 1809</p>
<div class="num" id="p1">
<span class="num">1</span>
<p class="indent">THIS was an appeal from the sentence of the circuit court for the district of Maryland, which condemned the schooner <i>General Pinkney</i> and cargo, for breach of the act of congress prohibiting intercourse with certain ports of the island of St. Domingo; <i>passed February</i>, 28<i>th</i> 1806. <i>Vol.</i> 8, <i>p.</i> 11. This act was limited to one year; but by the act of February 24th, 1807, it was continued until the end of the then next session of congress, when it expired on the 26th of April, 1808.</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">The schooner General Pinkney, on the 23d of August, 1806, was cleared from Alexandria for <i>St. Jago de Cuba</i> with a cargo, but went to <i>Cape Francois</i> in the island of St. Domingo, one of the prohibited ports. On her return, she was seized on the 17th of November, 1806, and libelled on the 5th of January, 1807, and condemned in the district court on the 23d of July following, which condemnation was affirmed in the circuit court on the 7th of November, from which sentence the claimants immediately appealed, in open court, to the supreme court of the United States, then next to be holden on the first Monday of February, 1808, where the cause was continued until the present term.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p3">
<span class="num">3</span>
<p class="indent">The only question now argued was, whether this court could now affirm the sentence of condemnation, inasmuch as the law which created the forfeiture, and authorized the condemnation, had expired?</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p4">
<span class="num">4</span>
<p class="indent">C. <i>Lee, Martin, Harper</i> and <i>Youngs</i>, for the appellants, contended that, in all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction, an appeal suspends entirely the sentence appealed from; and that in the appellate court the cause stands as if no sentence had been pronounced. 1 <i>Browne's Civil Law</i>, 495. 501. 1 <i>Br.

<p class="indent">If then the case stands as if no sentence of condemnation has been passed, the question arises, can this court now proceed to condemn the vessel when there is no law authorizing a condemnation?</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p6">

<p class="indent">The act of congress makes no provision for the recovery (after the expiration of the act) of penalties or forfeitures which had been incurred under that act during its existence.</p>

<p class="indent">And in such cases the law has always been understood to be, that the penalty or forfeiture cannot be enforced, nor the punishment inflicted.

<p class="indent">MARSHALL, Ch. J. delivered the opinion of the court to the following effect:</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p10">
<span class="num">10</span>
<p class="indent">The majority of the court is clearly of opinion, that in <i>admiralty</i> cases <i>an appeal</i> suspends the sentence altogether; and that it is not <i>res adjudicata</i> until the final sentence of the appellate court be pronounced. The cause in the appellate court is to be heard <i>de novo</i>, as if no sentence had been passed. This has been the uniform practice not only in cases of appeal from the district to the circuit courts of the United States, but in this court also.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p11">
<span class="num">11</span>
<p class="indent">In prize causes, the principle has never been disputed; and in the instance court, it is stated in 2 <i>Browne's Civil Law</i>, that in cases of appeal <i>it is lawful to allege what has not before been alleged, and to prove what has not before been proved</i>.<a class="footnote" href="#fn-s" id="fn-s_ref">*</a></p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p12">
<span class="num">12</span>
<p class="indent">The court is, therefore, of opinion, that this cause is to be considered as if no sentence had been pronounced; and if no sentence had been pronounced, it has been long settled, on general principles, that after the expiration or repeal of a law, no penalty can be enforced, nor punishment inflicted, for violations of the law committed while it was in force, unless some special provision be made for that purpose by statute.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p13">
<span class="num">13</span>
<p class="indent">The following sentence was then pronounced by the court:</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p14">
<span class="num">14</span>
<p class="indent">This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record, and was argued by counsel; on consideration whereof the court is of opinion, that an appeal from the sentence of a court of admiralty brings the whole case before the appellate court unaffected by the sentence of condemnation from which the appeal is made, and that a sentence of condemnation cannot be pronounced on account of a forfeiture which accrued under a law not in force at the time of pronouncing such sentence, unless, by some statutory provision, the right to enforce such forfeiture be preserved.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p15">
<span class="num">15</span>
<p class="indent">The court is, therefore, of opinion, that the sentence pronounced in this cause by the circuit court of the district of Maryland, affirming the sentence of the judge of the district court in this cause, be reversed and annulled; and the court, proceeding to pronounce the proper sentence, doth direct that the libel be dismissed, and the property libelled be restored to the claimants, they paying the duties thereon if the same have not been already paid.</p>

<p>MARSHALL, Ch. J. delivered the opinion of the court to the following effect:</p>
<p>The court thinks this case too plain to admit of argument, or to require deliberation. It is not within even the letter of the law, and it is certainly not within its spirit. The law did not intend to punish the intention, but the attempt to defraud the revenue.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*313</span> But as the construction of the law was liable to some question, the court will suffer the certificate of probable cause to remain as it is.

<p class="indent">ERROR to the circuit court of the district of Coumbia, sitting in Alexandria, in an action of <i>debt</i> upon a promissory note, negotiable in the bank of Alexandria, made by <i>Young</i> to <i>Yeaton</i>, and by him encorsed to the bank.</p>

<div class="num" id="p3">

<p class="indent">It further stated, that the counsel for the plaintiffs below, having filed his declaration at the return term, prayed the court to fix a day for the trial of the cause during the present term, and also to rule the defendant to plead at a short day during the term, and offered to consent that the defendant should plead the general issue, and under that plea give in evidence any special matter which he could plead either in bar or abatement; to which the defendant objected; but the court ruled him to plead the next day, and upon the general issue being joined, ruled him to trial immediately.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p5">
<span class="num">5</span>
<p class="indent">By the general rules of practice established by he circuit court it is ordered, that all process issuing from that court, except executions, be made returnable before the court in term time; and that <i>rules</i> be held in the clerk's office on the day after the rising of the court in each term, and on the same day in each month thereafter during the vacation; and that all proceedings and orders taken at the rules shall conform as near as may be to the rules of proceeding directed by an act of the assembly of Virginia, entitled 'An act reducing into one the several acts concerning the establishment, jurisdiction and powers of district courts,' and the several acts amending the same. By that act, which was passed December 12, 1792, it is ordered, that 'one month after he plaintiff hath filed his declaration he may give a rule to plead with the clerk, and if the defendant shall not plead accordingly at the expiration of such rule, the plaintiff may enter judgment for his debt or damages and costs.' 'All rules to declare, plead, reply, rejoin, or for other proceedings, shall be given regularly from month to month, shall be entered in a book to be kept for that purpose, and shall expire on the succeeding rule day.' By the 25th section of that act, it is provided that in certain cases the sheriff may take the engagement of an attorney of the court, endorsed on the writ, that he will appear for the defendant, 'and such appearance shall be entered with the clerk in the office, <i>on the first day after the end of the court to which such process is returnable, which</i> <i>is hereby declared to be the appearance day in all process returnable to any day of the court next preceding.'</i></p>

The summary trial is nothing more than a form of remedy iven by its charter, and cannot be binding upon the courts of the United States.

There has never been a doubt but that the district courts of Virginia had jurisdiction in cases in which the bank was plaintiff, and was bound, if requested, to compel the defendant to go to trial at the return term. The clause in the charter of the bank is an exception to the general law upon the subject of judicial proceedings; but the exception is equally valid with the general rule.</p>

v.<br/>
THE BANK OF ALEXANDRIA.</h1></center>
<center><p><b>Supreme Court of United States.</b></p></center>
<center>March 10, 1809.</center>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*50</span> <i>Youngs,</i> for the plaintiff in error.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*51</span> MARSHALL, Ch. J. delivered the opinion of the court as follows, viz.</p>
<p>The question in this case is, whether the endorsor of a note negotiable in the bank of Alexandria, if such endorsement be for accommodation, may be sued by the bank, before a suit shall be instituted against the maker, if the maker be solvent.</p>
<p>In Virginia, the endorsor of a promissory note was not, when the town of Alexandria was separated from that state, liable to the holder by any express statute. He was only liable under the implied contract created by his endorsement. This implied contract, by the general understanding of the country, was, that he would pay the debt, if by due diligence it could not be obtained from the maker. This condition, however, was not expressed. <span class="star-pagination">*52</span> Yet it was just, because it was consistent with general usage, and, therefore, was the real understanding with which such an endorsement was made and received.</p>
<p>But in banks, this is probably not the usage; and if it be not, then the same reason does not exist for annexing such a condition to the contract created by endorsement. If banks are understood to receive notes made negotiable with them, as subject to the law which governs inland bills of exchange, then it would seem reasonable, in the case of notes actually negotiated with them, to imply, from the act of endorsement, an undertaking conformable to that usage. If, then, the case showed that such was the usage of the bank, and such the understanding under which notes were discounted, this court is not prepared to say that the undertaking created by the endorsement would not be so fashioned as to give effect to the real intention of the parties.</p>
<p>But the incorporating act removes any doubt which might otherwise exist on this point.</p>
<p>The 20th section of that act declares, "that whenever any person or persons indebted to the said bank on bonds, bills, or notes, given or <i>endorsed</i> by them, with an express consent, in writing, that they may be negotiable at the said bank, and shall refuse or neglect to make payment at the time the <i>same</i> may become due, and a suit shall <i>thereupon</i> be commenced, &amp;c. judgment is to be rendered in a summary manner.</p>
<p>A person, then, may become indebted to the bank on a note endorsed by him, as well as on a note made by him; and the question is, when does he become indebted. The act appears to answer this question in the succeeding member of the sentence. The words are, "and shall refuse or neglect to make payment <i>at the time the same</i> may become due." To what antecedent does the words <i>"same"</i> refer? Most obviously to the words "bond, bill or note." When the bond, bill or note becomes <span class="star-pagination">*53</span> due, the maker or endorsor, who shall refuse or neglect to make payment, is within the description of the act. No man can be said to refuse or neglect to make payment, before the money is demandable from him, and till then no action can be brought. But the law proceeds to say, "and a suit shall <i>thereupon</i> be commenced." The word <i>"thereupon"</i> must refer to the note, or to the circumstances previously stated. Give it the one meaning or the other, and the law obviously contemplates a suit against the maker or endorsor, on his refusing or neglecting to pay such note, when it shall become due. The act then proceeds to say, that, when this suit shall be so commenced, the court shall render judgment thereon in a summary way.</p>
<p>It is alleged that the proceeding part of the section is all recital, and cannot, therefore, be construed to give a right to sue, where that right did not before exist: that the enacting clause gives no remedy where one did not before exist; but substitutes a summary mode of proceeding, for that more tedious action which the previous laws had given.</p>
<p>It is true that the first part of this section is recital; but it describes the precise case in which judgment shall be rendered in a summary way. That precise case is, where a person indebted, by making or endorsing a note negotiable and negotiated in the bank, shall refuse or neglect to make payment thereof, when such note shall become due. The time when he becomes indebted is declared to be, when the note becomes due.</p>
<p>It is alleged that an accommodation endorsor cannot then become indebted. This distinction was completely overruled in the case of Violet and Patton. The consideration moving from the bank to the maker of the note, on the credit of the endorsor, charges both the maker and the endorsor. The endorsor is, in this respect, as liable, both in reason and in law, to the claim of the bank, as if he had placed his name on the face instead of the back of the note.</p>
<p>Judgment affirmed with costs.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*54</span> JOHNSON, J.</p>
<p>Both the questions,<sup>[*]</sup> argued in this case, arise out of the act of Virginia incorporating the bank of Alexandria.</p>
<p>On the point of the summary jurisdiction, I concur with my brethren, and think this opinion perfectly consistent with the decision, at the last term, relative to the right of appeal. I remember that my opinion in that case was founded on the idea that the provisions of that act, relative to the summary recovery of debts, was entirely a judicial regulation. That the judicial power was unalienable from the sovereignty of a country, and must, therefore, in all its modifications, remain subject to the will of succeeding legislatures. That it was, in fact, a subject in which a peculiar, indefensible right could not be vested in an individual. I thought it, therefore, from its nature, unaffected by the clause of the act of acceptance reserving to the bank its corporate rights, and of course affected by the law which gives an appeal, generally, from the courts of this district to the supreme court, above a certain amount. I have no doubt of the power of congress to deprive them also of their summary remedy; but it has not yet legislated to that effect.</p>
<p>On the other question, I entertain a very strong opinion in opposition to that of the court.</p>
<p>The doctrine has been repeatedly sanctioned in this court, that, in the state of Virginia, the holder of a promissory note cannot recover against an endorsor without proving the insolvency of the drawer. But it is contended that the act, incorporating this bank, has placed the notes negotiable therein on a different footing; and that an endorsor of such a note may be sued as soon as it is dishonored, without any evidence of the insolvency of the drawer. The following are the words of the clause, so far as they are material to this case: "And whereas it is <span class="star-pagination">*55</span> absolutely necessary that debts due to the said bank should be punctually paid, to enable the directors to calculate with certainty and precision on meeting the demands that may be made upon them, be it enacted, that whenever any person or persons indebted to the said bank on bonds, bills, or notes, given or endorsed by them, with an express consent in writing that they may be negotiable at the said bank, and shall refuse or neglect to make payment at the time the same may become due, and a suit shall be thereupon commenced against such defaulter, and a <i>capias ad respondendum</i> returned and executed, or a copy left at the usual place of residence of such defaulter, at least ten days before the return day of such writ, the court shall," &amp;c. It then goes on and enacts, that, in such case, "the court shall order the proceedings to be made up, and the cause tried at the first court." This bare recital, or preamble, without one enacting word, is what is supposed to have effected this important change in the law of Virginia, relative to the liability of an endorsor. Much stress was laid, in the argument, upon the use of the word "indebted," as applied to the endorsor, the words "negotiable at the said bank," and words which suppose the commencement of a suit, as soon as a note "becomes due." I positively deny the correctness of maintaining any repeal or alteration in the principle of a law, upon an implication drawn from a mere preamble or recital to an act. Enacting words will undoubtedly often produce a repeal by implication, but a recital or preamble sets forth merely the motives or inducements of the legislator, and, whether founded in error or truth, serves no other purpose than to justify him to those for whom he is legislating, or, at times, to assist in developing the meaning of doubtful enacting words. Admit the principle, that a preamble may have the effect of enacting words, and there is no necessity for dilating on the inextricable absurdities in which a court may be involved. In the case before us, it is possible that the legislature may have supposed that the law of Virginia would sanction an immediate suit against the endorsor without evidence of the drawer's insolvency; <span class="star-pagination">*56</span> but their courts of justice have decided otherwise; and it would be singular if an erroneous opinion, entertained by that body, should have all the effects of a law passed by it. But there is not a word contained in this preamble which may not be fully satisfied, without producing any necessary implication against the general law of Virginia, relative to the liability of the endorsor.</p>
<p>When the legislature speaks of a person indebted by endorsement, it can only be understood to speak of one indebted according to the legal liability of an endorsor; which is only, by the laws of Virginia, in case of the insolvency of the drawer.</p>
<p>When it speaks of a consent in writing, that it may be negotiable at the said bank, it can only mean what it expresses; and intends it for the purpose of subjecting the individual to the summary recovery given in such a case; for, as to his general liability as endorsor, such a consent was in nowise necessary; that liability existed in its full extent without it.</p>
<p>And as to the supposition of the endorsor's liability to be sued when the note becomes due, this also is strictly and literally true, if the drawer should then be insolvent, or (I suppose) if he should become so at any time before the trial of the issue</p>
<p>Upon the whole, therefore, it appears to me that there is no possible difference between the liability of an endorsor generally, and an endorsor of a note negotiable in the bank of Alexandria; that the legislature intended to make no distinction; and, if it had expressly declared such to be its intent, no such change would have been produced, without following up that intention with sufficient enacting words; but that in fact, its sole object was to do that which it professes to intend, and alone has effected, viz. to give a summary remedy against all persons becoming indebted to that bank, whenever their legal liability is incurred. In fact it may, with the utmost correctness, <span class="star-pagination">*57</span> be affirmed of an endorsor that he is <i>indebted,</i> and that he may be sued when the note <i>becomes due,</i> without at all interfering with the laws of Virginia on this subject: for a thing may be <i>debitum in presenti,</i> and yet no cause of action exist against him; he may lie under a present obligation to pay a sum of money, upon some contingency or future event. And, with regard to his liability to be sued when the note becomes due, it may be very correctly affirmed that it is not due from him until the insolvency of the drawer can be shown. As to the drawer, the note is due when it is made payable; but the principles of the Virginia law add a contingency to the liability of the endorsor, so that, in fact, his undertaking is collateral and contingent, and the amount is not legally due from him until after the day of payment, and provided the drawer should prove insolvent.</p>

<p><span class="star-pagination">*314</span> <i>Martin</i> and <i>Jones,</i> for <i>Himely,</i> the appellant.</p>
<p><i>C. Lee,</i> contra.</p>
<p><i>Martin</i> and <i>Jones,</i> for the appellant.</p>
<p><i>C. Lee,</i> contra.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*316</span> MARSHALL, Ch. J. delivered the opinion of the court as follows:</p>
<p>A decree having been formerly rendered in this cause, the court is now to determine whether that decree has been executed according to its true intent and meaning.</p>
<p>That decree directed "the cargo of the Sarah to be restored to the original owners, subject to those charges of freight, insurance and other expenses which would have been incurred by them, in bringing the cargo into the United States."</p>
<p>In carrying this decree into execution, an allowance has been made for freight, and for expenses incurred at the port of importation; but no allowance has been made for expenses at the port of lading, nor for insurance. The appellants, too, were charged with interest on the money into which the cargo had been converted.</p>
<p>No exception having been taken to this report, it is now liable to those exceptions only which appear on its face.</p>
<p>So far as respects freight, and the expenses at the port of entry and delivery, the report must be considered as correct; but in those items of the claim which were disallowed, the error, if it be one, is apparent on the face of the proceedings, and may therefore be corrected.</p>
<p>The court has not considered the appellants as infected by the marine trespass committed by the captors of the Sarah and her cargo. Their operations commence with their purchase at St. Jago de Cuba; and the decree designed, and is thought to have been so expressed as to charge the owners with all the expenses which they would have incurred, had they made the purchase themselves. Had they <span class="star-pagination">*317</span> done so, they must have incurred some expenses at the port of lading. Among these is certainly not to be estimated the price of the cargo; but any expense necessarily attendant upon the transaction, such as putting the cargo on board, may properly, under this decree, be charged to the owners.</p>
<p>It is obvious, too, that the owners, or the underwriters, if they represent the owners, had they been the purchasers, must have insured the vessel and cargo from St. Jago de Cuba to the United States, or must themselves have stood insurers; in which latter case, the risk is deemed equal to the insurance. The decree, therefore, formerly rendered by this court, is understood to have entitled the appellants of insurance.</p>
<p>The question of interest is more doubtful; but this court is of opinion that the appellants ought not to be charged with interest.</p>
<p>Restitution of the cargo was awarded. The property having been sold, the money proceeding from the sales is substituted for the specific articles. If this money remains in possession of the court, it carries no interest; if it be in the hands of an individual, it may bear interest, or otherwise, as the court shall direct. But it is not supposed that the party, to whom restitution is awarded, receives interest in such case, unless it be decreed by the court. This court did not decree interest; nor would interest have been decreed, in this case, had the particular fact of the sale been brought before them.</p>
<p>The circumstances of the case were such as to restrain the court from inserting in its decree any thing which might increase its severity. The loss was heavy; and it fell unavoidably on one of two innocent parties. The court was not inclined to add to its weight, by giving interest in the nature of damages. The allowance of interest, therefore, in the court below is overruled.</p>
<p>The sentence of the circuit court is reversed.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*318</span> JOHNSON, J.</p>
<p>When the mandate of this court was received in the court below, auditors were nominated, by consent, to report what would be the usual mercantile allowance between the parties; and to state an account accordingly. Those auditors reported against the allowance of insurance, and in favour of interest. The supposition that the expense of transportation was not allowed. I am convinced, must be incorrect; for insurance and interest were the subject of the only two exceptions taken to their report. Upon hearing argument on these two exceptions, the court affirmed their report upon both these points, and I have since heard no reason to alter the opinion which I entertained on the argument below.</p>
<p>It is contended that the mandate of this court was peremptory as to the allowance of insurance, and did not sanction the charge of interest. The words of the mandate so far as relates to these points are the following: "subject to those charges for freight, insurance, and other expenses, which would have been incurred by the owners in bringing the cargo into the United States; which <i>equitable deductions</i> the defendants are at liberty <i>to show to the circuit court,</i>" &amp;c. These words imperatively require two things; viz. that the deductions, to be allowed to Himely, should be equitable in their nature, and should be shown to the court. Upon what ground could an allowance for insurance have been deemed just or equitable? It could only have been upon Himely's having actually paid an insurance, which he was at liberty to show, or upon his having himself incurred that risk which would have been covered by insurance. The fact was admitted that he had not insured, and as to having incurred any risk himself, I cannot understand in what possible view he could have incurred a risk, when this court has decided that if the property had been lost, he would have lost nothing. It was not the property of Himely, it was the property of Rose; had it been sunk in the ocean, it would not have been the loss of Himely, it would have <span class="star-pagination">*319</span> been the loss of Rose; there can be no reason, then, why Rose, who ran all the risk, should be adjudged to pay an insurance to Himely, who incurred no risk: but such is the effect of deducting it from the sum to be paid to Rose. After deciding that the property was not changed, that it still continued in Rose, and was never vested in Himely, I feel confused by the inquiry on what possible ground the allowance for insurance can be sanctioned.</p>
<p>With regard to interest, the question is not so clear, but the difficulty does not arise upon the abstract equity of the charge. In equity, interest goes with the principal, as the fruit with the tree. Rose is now to be considered as the rightful owner of the property, and ought to have had the possession and use of it, during the existence of this contest. But Himely, having given stipulation bonds, was, by the order of the district court, admitted to the possession and use of it, added it to his capital, traded upon it, and made such profits and advantages of it as his skill or ingenuity suggested. Rose, in the mean time, was kept out of the use of it, and lost those emoluments and mercantile advantages which might have resulted from the use of it. It was not a case in which the property is locked up in a warehouse, or the proceeds thereof deposited in the hands of the register of this court, but a case in which the goods were, in fact, converted into money by the effect of the stipulation bond, and the use of it given to Himely, to the prejudice of Rose: there could, therefore, be no radical objection to the charge, on the ground of equity. Had the mandate issued to restore to the party a flock of sheep, or stock, or bonds bearing interest, it is presumed that it would have been construed to authorize the delivery of their natural or artificial increase without any express words to carry them. But it is said that the mandate does not expressly authorize this allowance. This is true; but it must be recollected that the mandate of this court enjoins the allowance of <i>equitable deductions.</i> Now a variety of deductions <span class="star-pagination">*320</span> may be, in the abstract, equitable, but may lose that character by its being made to appear that ample compensation has been already made for them. It was in this light that the court below sustained the charge of interest: because having had the usufruct of the property concerning which those charges on his part, which merited the denomination of <i>equitable deductions,</i> were incurred, it appeared to the court in fact that he had been compensated in part for those advances by the use of the money. If this court had not made use of the terms <i>equitable deductions,</i> that court probably would not have thought itself sanctioned in doing what appeared so equitable between the parties.</p>

<p><span class="star-pagination">*23</span> <i>Rodney,</i> Attorney-General, for the plaintiff in error.</p>
<p><i>Lewis,</i> contra.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*31</span> MARSHALL, Ch. J. delivered the opinion of the court as follows, viz.</p>
<p>This case depends entirely on the acts of the legislature of Pennsylvania, respecting the registering of deeds.</p>
<p>The law of Pennsylvania, on this subject, had varied at different times; but as it stood in 1715, when the act passed which must decide this controversy, the recording of a deed was not necessary to its validity; but deeds might be enrolled, and an exemplification was testimony in all courts.</p>
<p>The act of 1715 established an office of record in <span class="star-pagination">*32</span> each county in which deeds were to be recorded, and declared an exemplification from the record to be as good evidence as the original. This act, however, does not make the recording of a deed essential to its validity.</p>
<p>To entitle a deed to be recorded, the act requires that it shall be acknowledged or proved "before one of the justices of the peace of the proper county or city where the lands lie."</p>
<p>In this case the lands lie in different counties; and the deed was acknowledged before John Lawrence, one of the justices of the supreme court of Pennsylvania; and was recorded in the office for the city and county of Philadelphia, in which a part of the lands lie. The land, however, for which this suit was brought, lies in a different county.</p>
<p>The first question which presents itself in this cause is, was this deed properly proved?</p>
<p>Were this act of 1715 now, for the first time, to be construed, the opinion of this court would certainly be, that the deed was not regularly proved. A justice of the supreme court would not be deemed a justice of the county, and the decision would be, that the deed was not properly proved, and therefore not legally recorded.</p>
<p>But, in construing the statutes of a state on which land titles depend, infinite mischief would ensue, should this court observe a different rule from that which has been long established in the state; and in this case, the court cannot doubt that the courts of Pennsylvania consider a justice of the supreme court as within the description of the act.</p>
<p>It is of some weight that this deed was acknowledged by the chief justice, who certainly must have been acquainted with the construction given to the act, and that the acknowledgment was taken before another judge of the supreme court. It is also recollected <span class="star-pagination">*33</span> that the gentlemen of the bar, who supported the conveyance, spoke positively as to the universal understanding of the state, on this point, and that those who controverted the usage on other points, did not controvert it on this. But what is decisive with the court is, that the judge who presides in the circuit court for the district of Pennsylvania, reports to us that this construction was universally received.</p>
<p>On this evidence the court yields the construction which would be put on the words of the act, to that which the courts of the state have put on it, and on which many titles may probably depend.</p>
<p>The next question is, was this deed recorded in such an office as to make the exemplification evidence?</p>
<p>Without reviewing all the arguments which have been urged from the bar, or all the sections of the act, it may be sufficient to observe, that this court is satisfied that, where a single tract of land is conveyed, the law requires the deed to be recorded in the office of the county in which the land lies; but if several tracts be conveyed, it appears to this court that neither the letter nor the spirit of the act requires that the deed should be recorded in each county.</p>
<p>It is material in the construction of this act, that the validity of the deed is not affected by omitting to record it. Though not recorded, it is still binding to every intent and purpose whatsoever. The only legal effect produced by recording it is its preservation, by making a copy equal to the original. The principal motive, then, for requiring that it should be proved before a justice of the particular county in which the land lies, and recorded in that county, is that which has been assigned at the bar. It is the additional security given by those provisions, that a deed, never executed, might not be imposed on the recorder. This object is as completely obtained by placing the deed on the records of that county in <span class="star-pagination">*34</span> which one of the tracts of land lies, as it could be if the deed conveyed no other tract. The verity of the deed is as completely secured in the one case as in the other.</p>
<p>It appears to the court also to be within the letter of the law. This deed was unquestionably properly admitted to record in the office of the city and county of Philadelphia. It conveyed lands lying within that city and county, and, on any construction of the act, might be there recorded. The act then proceeds to say, "that the copies of all deeds, so enrolled, shall be allowed in all courts where produced, and are hereby declared and enacted to be as good evidence, and as valid and effectual in law, as the original deeds themselves."</p>
<p>The whole deed, then, is evidence by the letter of the act. The whole is a copy from the record. If the validity of the conveyance depended on its being recorded in the county where the land lies, then a deed might be good as to one tract, and bad as to another. But the deed is valid, though not recorded; and the question is, whether the copy is evidence as to every thing it contains. The execution of the deed is one entire thing, and is proved so as to admit the instrument to record. The copy, if true in part, is true in the whole; and if evidence in part, must, under the act, and on the general principle that it is the copy of a record, be evidence in the whole.</p>
<p>There is no error in the judgment of the circuit court; and <i>it is affirmed with costs.</i></p>

<center><h1>PIERCE<br/>
v.<br/>
TURNER.</h1></center>
<center><p><b>Supreme Court of United States.</b></p></center>
<center>March 13, 1809.</center>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*157</span> <i>E.J. Lee,</i> for the plaintiff in error.</p>
<p><i>C. Simms, P.B. Key</i> and <i>Jones,</i> contra.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*164</span> WASHINGTON, J. delivered the opinion of the court as follows, viz.</p>
<p>This is an action brought by a creditor of Charles Turner, against Rebecca Turner, who is charged as his executrix; and the questions submitted to the consideration of the court are, 1st. Whether the slaves, mentioned in the deed of the 14th of February, 1798, are to be taken as assets belonging to the estate of Charles Turner; and if so, then, 2d. Whether Mrs. Turner can, under the circumstances of this case, be properly charged as an executrix of her own wrong? If the first question be determined in favour of the defendant in error, it will become unnecessary to consider the second; as it does not appear that Mrs. Turner intermeddled in any mauner with the estate of her deceased husband, unless these slaves did, in point of law, constitute a part of that estate.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*165</span> The first question depends upon the construction which the court may give to the 4th section of the statute of Virginia, passed on the 13th of December, 1792, entitled "An act for regulating conveyances," which declares that all conveyances of land, marriage settlements of lands, slaves, or other personal property, deeds of trust and mortgages thereafter made should be void as to <i>all creditors and subsequent purchasers,</i> unless the same were acknowledged or proved, and recorded within the time prescribed by the statute; but that the same as between the parties and their heirs should nevertheless be valid and binding.</p>
<p>The deed from Rebecca Kenner, the defendant in error, previous to her intermarriage with Charles Turner, by which the slaves in question were settled on the said Charles Turner and herself, during their lives, and the life of the longest liver of them, with remainder to the heirs of the said Rebecca, not having been proved and recorded within the time prescribed by law, it is contended by the plaintiff in error that the same became void as to the creditors of Charles Turner, whose rights remained unimpaired by that deed, in the same manner as if it had never been made; in which case, it is not denied that an absolute estate would have vested in the husband, on his marriage.</p>
<p>This argument proceeds upon the ground, that by the words "all creditors and subsequent purchasers," is meant as well the creditors of the grantee and subsequent purchasers from him, as those who might derive title under the grantor. Although the words are certainly broad enough to comprehend the whole, it is believed by a majority of the court that the construction should be such as to limit the application of them to the creditors of, and subsequent purchasers from, the grantor. In no case but one, where a title can be set up for the grantee paramount the deed, can it ever be the interest of a creditor of the grantee to insist upon such a construction as is contended for in this; for as he must derive his title <span class="star-pagination">*166</span> under the deed, if it be void as to him, it is impossible for him to found a claim upon it in right of the grantee, whose only title is under the deed. It would be strange that a deed should be binding upon the grantee and his heirs, and yet void as to persons claiming under him, for a valuable consideration; and yet such would be the consequence, if the words "all creditors and subsequent purchasers" should be understood to apply to persons claiming under the grantee as well as those claiming under the grantor. Indeed it would seem repugnant and absurd to apply the same expressions to persons, who, if they claim at all, must claim under the deed, and also to those who claim against the deed; in the latter case, the invalidity of the deed is consistent with the claim, in the former it is destructive of it.</p>
<p>It may be said, however, that these observations are inapplicable to this particular case, because the creditors of the husband do not claim under but against the deed; and, in this respect, stand upon the same ground as the creditors of the grantor. But if in every other case which can be stated, the invalidity of the deed is applicable to the creditors of the grantor, or those claiming under him, and to none other, by what rule of construction can the same words have a more extended meaning, so as to be applied to persons who claim in right of a party to the same deed other than the grantor. If the deed in question had granted to Charles Turner an estate in fee as to the land, and for life in respect to the slaves, would it have been void as to simple contract creditors, who could go only against the personal estate, and good as to specialty creditors, who might subject the real assets? and yet, if the deed be void at all, as to the <i>creditors of the husband,</i> it must be so throughout; in which case it might well be doubted whether the land could be made liable to the payment of the husband's debts; or, to present the question in a less doubtful shape, would the deed be considered void as to a purchaser, from the husband, of the slaves, and good as to a purchaser of the land? Let the true interpretation of the words "all <span class="star-pagination">*167</span> creditors and subsequent purchasers" be once ascertained, and every difficulty in the case is at an end. If they are construed to mean the creditors of the grantor, or subsequent purchasers from him, then, the deed being good between all the parties to it, no estate vested in Charles Turner, but such as the deed itself passed to him. The title of his creditors being clearly derivative, if he had no title under the deed, (and being himself bound by it, he could have none which was inconsistent with it,) then his creditors could have none. But if he had a title incompatible with that granted by the deed, then he was not bound by the deed; contrary to the statute which declares that he was bound. If his creditors have any such title, it cannot be derived from him, when, in point of law, he had none in himself; and, independent of his title, it is impossible to show any in them. If a subsequent purchaser, with notice of a prior unrecorded deed, could not prevail against the title of the first purchaser, and most unquestionably he could not, how much stronger is the case when such subsequent purchaser is even a party to the first deed, and claims an interest under it? To say in this case, that, upon the marriage of Charles Turner, or at any time afterwards, the law cast upon him an estate in the property conveyed by this deed, of which he had notice, and to which he was a party, inconsistent with the estate conveyed to him by that deed, (and this must be said, if his creditors can claim such estate in his right,) is, in the opinion of a majority of the court, repugnant to the plain meaning and spirit of the law under consideration.</p>
<p>That creditors of the husband, or purchasers from him, may be injured by the construction which this court feels itself compelled to give to this law, need not be denied; but it is not for this tribunal to afford them relief. It might, perhaps, be well if the law were so amended as to render deeds made in contemplation of marriage void in express terms, as <i>to the creditors of the husband, or purchasers from him,</i> in case the same should not be recorded within the time prescribed by law.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*168</span> The court has felt some difficulty in consequence of a decision of the court of appeals in the case of <i>Anderson</i> v. <i>Anderson</i><i>;</i> but it is believed that the judgment in that case was perfectly correct, let the particular point which occurs in this cause be settled one way or the other. In that case, the contract was not only executory and rendered void, at law, by the subsequent intermarriage of the parties to the contract, but it was, at the time when the slaves were taken in execution, perfectly contingent whether the wife could ever claim any interest in them, in opposition to persons deriving title under the husband. For if the husband should have survived the wife, or if they should have had issue, the absolute legal estate of the husband, gained by the intermarriage, would have remained unaffected by the deed. There was, therefore, no reason why the creditors of the husband should be prevented from receiving satisfaction of their debts out of his legal estate in the slaves, because it was subject to an equitable contingent interest in the wife, which might never become effectual. A court of equity might well say to her, as you have no remedy, at law, for a breach of the contract by the husband, in consequence of not having interposed trustees to protect your rights, and have omitted to record the deed by which creditors and subsequent purchasers might be defrauded, we will not now decree you a specific performance against creditors who have law and equity on their side.</p>
<p>Decree affirmed.</p>
<p>JOHNSON, J.</p>
<p>I am unfortunate enough to dissent from my brethren in this case. I think the creditors of Turner entitled to recover, and entitled to recover in <i>this form of action.</i></p>
<p>I will not contest the general principle, that the creditors, to whose benefit this act must be understood to operate, are the creditors of that party only from whom the estate moves. But this case presents an exception to the general rule; and the reasoning, <span class="star-pagination">*169</span> from which the general conclusion results, will be found inapplicable to the case of husband and wife, with regard to the personal estate of the latter.</p>
<p>The words of the act are admitted to be sufficiently comprehensive to include the creditors of both: the general rule is, that the letter must prevail; and it is only when an adherence to the letter will involve a court in absurdity, or inextricable difficulty, that the spirit is resorted to as a restriction upon the literal meaning. But the construction which I give to this act removes repugnance and absurdity, and produces a concordance between the letter and the spirit, which appears to my mind conclusive upon its correctness.</p>
<p>What was the object of the legislature? It was to protect the community from that false credit which men acquire in society, from the possession of or supposed interest in property; to place within their reach the means of avoiding those frauds which may be practised upon them, by the possessor of property, when an estate or interest in it exists, in fact, in some other person.</p>
<p>The argument in favour of the defendant is, that the creditors of the grantee can derive no benefit from a deed which the act declares void, and which, consequently, could vest no interest in their debtor. Through him they must claim, and no other estate but that which existed in him, ought to be subjected to their debts.</p>
<p>I will not pass an opinion upon the correctness of an argument which, in the case where possession follows the alienation, may make the act productive of the very fraud which it was intended to obviate. My opinion is founded upon a ground which is unaffected by the conclusion upon this point, or rather in perfect coincidence with that conclusion. I deduce my conclusion from the consideration that the claim of Turner's creditors is not derived through <span class="star-pagination">*170</span> the deed, but is, in fact, in direct hostility with its operation. The effect of the marriage, in transferring the property to the husband, is the foundation of their claim; and the deed executed on the intermarriage of the defendant with Charles Turner, constitutes the subject of the defence against their claim. The creditors, in order to maintain their action, prove, first, the property in the wife before marriage, then her intermarriage with their debtor. These facts, in operation of law, upon her personal property, sustain their right of recovery. But, in opposition to their claim, the wife endeavours to avail herself of this deed; and this question is brought up on an exception taken by the creditors to its legal validity. The ground of their objection is, that it wants that evidence of authenticity, which the law requires, to make it, as to them, a valid instrument. No doubt is entertained with regard to the invalidity of this instrument, as to the description of creditors; but it is contended, on behalf of the defendant, that no other creditors can avail themselves of that objection, except the creditors of the wife before marriage. There appears to me to be no reason for the distinction in the case of husband and wife. Her creditors before marriage become his during coverture; she can contract no debts to which she can be made personally liable; her personal property becomes his by the act of intermarriage, and he acquires all the credit, in society, resulting from the acquisition and possession of that property. It is not upon a deed, which this act declares void, that the creditors found their claim, but upon an act in <i>pais,</i> the operation of which is an immediate transfer of property, unless that effect be prevented by the legal execution of some instrument of writing. If such an instrument, executed before marriage, be not recorded within eight months, it loses all legal validity as to creditors, and it is the same as if no such instrument had ever been executed. The recording, as to them, is as necessary as the sealing and delivery is between the parties.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*171</span> The consistency of this opinion with the argument that the creditors of the grantee can derive no interest under a deed which, as to them, is declared void, will appear from distinctly reflecting on the necessary consequence of such an admission in this case. Declare the deed void, and what is the consequence? It no longer affects the property of the wife, so as to produce a state of things different from that which would exist if it had never been created; and the operation of the deed was not to vest an interest or estate in Charles Turner, but to prevent any estate from vesting in him by the ordinary effect of marriage. Remove the preventing cause, and the property becomes, unquestionably, subject to the husband's debts.</p>
<p>Two objections to this opinion have been urged, on which it may be proper to make some remarks. The first that I shall notice is, how the same deed can be valid as between the parties, so as really to prevent any transfer of property to the husband, and yet, through him, creditors may derive such an interest as to subject it to the payment of his debts. If this argument proves any thing, it proves too much. A moment's reflection will show, that it is as applicable to the case of the grantor as of the grantee; for, after the execution of the deed, the grantor has, in fact, and in the acknowledgment of the act, no more interest in the property than the grantee had before its execution, or upon its becoming void for want of recording. But every apparent absurdity may be reconciled thus. Legal claims must be supported by legal proof. The abstract rights of parties become immaterial, if not susceptible of substantiation by evidence. In a question, then, between the direct representatives of the husband and wife, the deed is a valid instrument, and may be received as duly authenticated written evidence, to support a right derived under it. But, between the one party and the creditor of the other, the law declares it wholly inefficacious, for want of a ceremony which is made essential to its authenticity. The most ordinary deed cannot be <span class="star-pagination">*172</span> received in evidence until proved according to the rules of evidence; and the operation of individual acts, in producing transfers of property, must ever be subject to such modifications as may be made by positive law.</p>
<p>The other difficulty arises from the consideration how this deed can be valid against all persons (which it confessedly is) during eight months, and then cease to operate as to creditors. To this it may be answered, that this objection, as well as the preceding, is equally applicable to the case of the creditor both of alienor and alienee; and, if valid at all, might defeat the operation of this act altogether. But, as a provision of positive law, such considerations are not to defeat it. Possibly some inconvenience may result from holding property in this suspended situation; but the duration of the inconvenience is not long, nor the contingency far remote. Nor is an analogous state of things unknown to the common or civil lawyer; executory devises, contingent remainders, and shifting uses, produce a similar uncertainty and suspension of right. During the eight months which are given for recording a deed, the interests of parties must have vested only <i>sub modo,</i> or subject to the contingency of recording it within the legal time: and no doubt a court of equity would interpose its authority, during that period, to adjust the rights of parties. Nor will this objection at all affect the opinion which I entertain respecting the rights of the plaintiff; for, although the deed certainly did hold the personal property of the wife in a suspended state, during the eight months, so that the creditors could not, in that time, have taken it under execution, yet, after the expiration of that period, the deed lost its protecting effect, and that property then became subject to their debts.</p>
<p>These views of the subject appeared to me to solve every difficulty, and lead to a conclusion upon the second point made in the argument; viz. whether the defendant may be charged as executrix <i>de son tort.</i> The case of <i>Harding &amp; Mercer</i> comes <span class="star-pagination">*173</span> fully up to the present, and it will be found of necessity, in order to give effect to this act, that this remedy should be countenanced. The hardships of it would, no doubt, be remedied by a court of equity, in cases free from collusion or moral fraud, so as to prevent the defendant from being charged to an amount greater than the value of the goods which actually came to her hands. But the necessity of sanctioning this mode of pursuing property, circumstanced as in this case, will appear from the impossibility of a creditor's getting at it in any other manner, at law. Should the creditor himself administer, he can never recover it, because, as the legal representative of the husband, the deed would be valid against him without being recorded. Should any other person administer, he could never be charged with the value of assets, which for the same reason, could never come to his hands. So that both precedent and principle concur in supporting the correctness of permitting him to resort to the present remedy.</p>

<center><h1>RIDDLE &amp; CO.<br/>
v.<br/>
MANDEVILLE AND JAMESSON.</h1></center>
<center><p><b>Supreme Court of United States.</b></p></center>
<center>March 13, 1809.</center>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*324</span> <i>E.J. Lee,</i> for the plaintiffs in error.</p>
<p><i>Youngs,</i> contra.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*328</span> MARSHALL, Ch. J. delivered the opinion of the court as follows:</p>
<p>This suit is brought by the holder of a promissory note to recover its amount from a remote endorsor. In a suit between the same parties, this court had previously determined that the plaintiff was without remedy at law. It is now to be decided whether he is entitled to the aid of a court of equity.</p>
<p>If, as was stated by the counsel for the defendants, the question is, whether a court of chancery <span class="star-pagination">*329</span> would create contracts into which individuals had never entered, and decree the payment of money from persons who had never undertaken to pay it, the time of this court has been very much misapplied indeed in attending to the laborious discussion of this cause. The court would, at once, have disclaimed such a power, and have terminated so extraordinary a controversy.</p>
<p>But the real questions in the case are understood to be, whether the plaintiffs, as endorsees of a promissory note, have a right, under the laws of Virginia, to receive its amount from the endorsor on the insolvency of the maker; whether the defendants, as the original endorsors of the note, are ultimately responsible for it; and whether equity will decree the payment to be immediately made, by the person ultimately responsible, to the person who is actually entitled to receive the money.</p>
<p>This note came to the hands of M`Clenachan, endorsed in blank by Mandeville and Jamesson. M`Clenachan had a right to fill up the endorsement to himself, and he has done so. The law, as understood in Virginia, immediately implied an <i>assumpsit</i> from Mandeville and Jamesson to M`Clenachan to pay him the amount of the note, if he should use due diligence, and should be unable to obtain payment from the maker. M`Clenachan endorsed this note to the plaintiffs, and, by so doing, became liable to them in like manner as Mandeville and Jamesson were liable to him.</p>
<p>The maker having proved insolvent, the plaintiffs have a legal right to claim payment from M`Clenachan, and, on making that payment, M`Clenachan would be reinvested with all his original rights in the note, and would be entitled to demand-payment from Mandeville and Jamesson.</p>
<p>If there were twenty successive endorsors of a note, this circuitous course might be pursued, and, <span class="star-pagination">*330</span> by the time the ultimate endorsor was reached, the value of the note would be expended in the pursuit. This circumstance alone would afford a strong reason for enabling the holder to bring all the endorsors into that court which could, in a single decree, put an end to litigation. No principle adverse to such a proceeding is perceived. Its analogy to the familiar case of a suit in chancery by a creditor against the legatees of his debtor is not very remote. If an executor shall have distributed the estate of his testator, the creditor has an action at law against him, and he has his remedy against the legatees. The creditor has no action at law against the legatees. Yet it has never been understood that the creditor is compelled to resort to his legal remedy. He may bring the executor and legatees both before a court of chancery, which court will decree immediate payment from those who are ultimately bound. If the executor and his securities should be insolvent, so that a suit at law must be unproductive, the creditor would have no other remedy than in equity, and his right to the aid of that court could not be questioned.</p>
<p>If doubts of his right to sue in chancery could be entertained while the executor was solvent, none can exist after he had become insolvent. Yet the creditor would have no legal claim on the legatees, and could maintain no action at law against them. The right of the executor, however, may, in a court of equity, be asserted by the creditor, and, as the legatees would be ultimately responsible for his debt, equity will make them immediately responsible.</p>
<p>In the present case, as in that which has been stated, the insolvency of M`Clenachan furnishes strong additional motives for coming into a court of chancery. Mandeville and Jamesson are ultimately bound for this money, but the remedy at law is defeated by the bankruptcy of an intermediate endorsor. It is only a court of equity which can afford a remedy.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*331</span> This subject may and ought to be contemplated in still another point of view. It has been repeatedly observed that the action against the endorsor is not given by statute. The contract on which the suit is maintained is not expressed, but is implied from the endorsement itself, unexplained and unaccompanied by any additional testimony. Such a contract must, of necessity, conform to the general understanding of the transaction. General opinion certainly attaches credit to a note, the maker of which is doubtful, in proportion to the credit of the endorsors, and two or more good endorsors are deemed superior to one. But if the last endorsor alone can be made responsible to the holder, then the preceding names are of no importance, and would add nothing to the credit of the note. But this general opinion is founded on the general understanding of the nature of the contract. The endorsor is understood to pass to the endorsee every right founded on the note which he himself possesses. Among these is his right against the prior endorsor. This right is founded on an implied contract, which is not, by law, assignable. Yet if it is capable of being transferred in equity, it vests, as an equitable interest, in the holder of the note. No reason is perceived why such an interest should not, as well as an interest in any other <i>chose in action,</i> be transferible in equity. And if it be so transferable, equity will of course afford a remedy. The defendant sustains no injury, for he may defend himself in equity against the holder as effectually as he could defend himself against his immediate assignee in a suit at law.</p>
<p>The case put, of the sale and delivery of a personal thing, is not thought to be analogous to this. The purchaser of a personal thing does not, at the time of the contract, look beyond the vendor. He does not trace the title. It passes by delivery. But suppose the vendor held it by a bill of sale containing a warranty of title, and should assign that bill to his vendee; is it clear that, on loss of the property for defect of title, no recourse could <span class="star-pagination">*332</span> be had to the warrantor of that title? The court is not prepared to answer this question in the affirmative.</p>
<p>It is contended that the endorsee of the note holds it subject to every equity to which it was liable in the hands of the endorsor.</p>
<p>If this be admitted, it is not perceived that the admission would, in any manner, affect this case.</p>
<p>It is also contended that the plaintiff can only recover what he actually paid.</p>
<p>Without indicating any opinion on this point, the court considers it as very clear that the endorsement is <i>prima facie</i> evidence of having endorsed for full value, and it is incumbent on the defendant to show the real consideration, if it was an inadequate one.</p>
<p>Usury has been stated in the argument, but it is neither alleged in the pleadings, nor proved by the testimony.</p>
<p>It is urged that Mandeville and Jamesson are securities who have received no actual value, and that equity will not charge a security who is discharged at law. In support of this argument the case of a joint obligation is cited.</p>
<p>It is true, that, in the case of a joint obligation, the court has refused to set up the bond against the representatives of a security. But, in that case, the law had absolutely discharged them. In this case, Mandeville and Jamesson are not discharged. They are not released from the implied contract created by the endorsement. It is the legal remedy which is obstructed; the right is unimpaired, and the original obligation is in full force.</p>
<p>It is, then, the opinion of this court that, without referring to the depositions to which exceptions have been taken, a right exists in the holder of a promissory <span class="star-pagination">*333</span> note, at least where he cannot obtain payment at law, to sue a remote endorsor in equity.</p>
<p>Certainly, in such a case, the defendant has a right to insist on the other endorsors being made parties, but he has not done so; and, in this case, the court does not perceive that M`Clenachan is a party so material in the cause, that a decree may not properly be made without him.</p>
<p>The decree is reversed, and the defendants directed to pay the amount of the note to the plaintiffs.</p>
<p>The decree of the court was as follows:</p>
<p>This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record of the circuit court for the county of Alexandria, and was argued by counsel. On consideration whereof, the court is of opinion, that the decree of the said circuit court, dismissing the bill of the plaintiffs, is erroneous, and ought to be reversed; and this court doth reverse the same; and this court, proceeding to give such decree as the said circuit court ought to have given, doth decree and order, that the defendants pay to the plaintiffs the sum of 1,500 dollars, that being the amount of the note in the bill mentioned, together with interest thereon from the time the same became due.</p>

<p class="indent">ERROR to the circuit court of the district of Columbia, in an action on the case upon a policy of insurance on the brig <i>Richard, at and from Tobago to one or more ports in the West Indies, and at and from thence to Norfolk</i>. The following clause was inserted in the body of the policy. '<i>This insurance is declared to be made against all risks, blockaded ports and Hispaniola excepted</i>.' And at the foot of the policy was the following memorandum: '<i>Warranted</i> by the assured <i>free from any charge, damage or loss</i>, which may arise in consequence of <i>seizure</i> or <i>detention</i> of the property, <i>for or on account of illicit or prohibited trade</i>.'</p>

<p class="indent">On the trial of the general issue, four bills of exception were taken in the court below by the plaintiff in error.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p3">
<span class="num">3</span>
<p class="indent">1. The first was to the admission in evidence of certain copies of the proceedings and decree of the vice-admiralty court at Jamaica, ordering a sale to pay the salvage of the brig. The copies were authenticated by the following certificates, viz. 'Jamaica, <i>ss.</i> I, Adam Dolmage, Esq. deputy of Owsley Rowley, Esq. chief registrar and scribe of the acts, causes and businesses of the court of vice-admiralty within the said island, duly constituted, appointed and sworn, do hereby certify and make known to all whom it doth or may concern, that the several sheets of paper writing hereunto annexed, in number fifteen, and marked or numbered from No. 1. to No. 15. inclusive, do contain a true copy and transcript of certain process and proceedings, had, moved, and prosecuted to interlocutory decree in the said court, in a certain cause therein lately depending, entitled, 'Brig Richard, Jacobs, master.' In which cause Benjamin Jacobs hath duly filed his claim thereto in the said court; and I further certify, that I have carefully compared and examined the same with the originals remaining of record in my office.</p>

<p class="indent">It was further testified by competent witnesses, examined upon oath by the court, that the said Henry J. Hinchliffe, in the year 1804, publicly sat as a judge of, and held the court of vice-admiralty in Jamaica, and in that capacity condemned the vessel of one of the witnesses, who, in the island of Jamaica, received from his proctor a copy of the proceedings in the said court in his cause, which copy was authenticated in the same manner as the paper now offered in evidence, and under a similar seal; and that upon producing that copy to the underwriters in Alexandria and in Philadelphia, the loss was paid without delay. That similar papers, purporting to be copies of proceedings in the same court of vice-admiralty in other cases, had been received in this country by other persons, and had been considered by both insurers and insured as authentic papers, and losses had been paid thereon; and that the present paper was shown to the defendant, who did not object to its authentication, but refused to pay the loss for other reasons. But neither of the witnesses had ever seen the judge write, nor the act of affixing the seal of the court to any paper.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p11">
<span class="num">11</span>
<p class="indent">2. The second bill of exceptions stated, in substance, that the defendant (the plaintiff in error) prayed the court to instruct the jury, that if at the time the brig Richard sailed from Tobago for Curracoa, the latter island was actually blockaded, and the brig turned away by the blockading force, and afterwards lost, without again attempting to enter Curracoa, and in the prosecution of her voyage to Norfolk, the plaintiff below was not entitled to recover, although no official notification of such blockade was ever published, and although the master of the brig was ignorant of such blockade until he met with the blockading force. Which instruction the court refused to give.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p12">
<span class="num">12</span>
<p class="indent">3. The third bill of exceptions stated, that the plaintiff below offered to read in evidence certain depositions taken in Tobago, under a commission issued at the instance of the <i>defendant</i>, and the court, being satisfied that the plaintiff's attorney had agreed to receive, and did receive and transmit to the plaintiff, notice of the time and place of taking such depositions, suffered the plaintiff to read them in evidence to the jury.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p13">
<span class="num">13</span>
<p class="indent">4. The fourth bill of exceptions was to the opinion of the court given to the jury at the request of the plaintiff, that if at the time the brig sailed from Tobago for Curracoa the latter island was not a blockaded port by notification of the British government to the American nation, but was blockaded in fact, and if the master was ignorant of such blockade until he was warned off by the blockading force, and being so warned he did not again attempt to enter the blockaded port, but changed his course intending to come directly to Norfolk, and in the prosecution of such voyage to Norfolk was captured by a French cruiser, and recaptured by an English vessel, carried into Jamaica, libelled, condemned and sold under a decree of the vice-admiralty court of that island, then such sailing from Tobago for Curracoa, and from thence to Norfolk, was a lawful voyage within the meaning of the contract of insurance, and not within the exception in the policy, and the plaintiff was entitled to recover against the underwriters an indemnity for the loss sustained by such capture, recapture and sale.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Youngs</i>, for the plaintiff in error, contended,</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p15">
<span class="num">15</span>
<p class="indent">1. That blockaded ports were absolutely excepted from the policy, and, consequently, there was no insurance if the vessel sailed for a blockaded port. The exception amounts to a warranty that the vessel shall not sail for a blockaded port; and the insured takes upon himself the chance of the port being blockaded. <i>Park</i>, 322. 367. <i>Kenyon</i> v. <i>Berthow</i>.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p16">
<span class="num">16</span>
<p class="indent">2. That the copy of the proceedings of the court of vice admiralty, at Jamaica, was not sufficiently authenticated to be admitted in evidence. The act of congress does not designate any mode of authentication of foreign papers, but has left that subject entirely to the state legislatures. As the court below was sitting at Alexandria, it ought to have been governed by the act of assembly of Virginia of December 8, 1792, (<i>Revised Code</i>, 168. <i>fol. ed.</i>) which requires, besides the attestation of a notary public, '<i>a testimonial</i> from the proper officer of the city, county, corporation, or borough where such notary public shall reside, or the <i>great seal</i> of such state, kingdom, province, island, colony, or place beyond sea.'</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p17">
<span class="num">17</span>
<p class="indent">In the case of <i>Church</i> v. <i>Hubbart</i>, 2 <i>Cranch</i>, 238. this court said, that foreign judgments were to be authenticated, either by an exemplification under the great seal, or by a proved copy, or by the certificate of an officer authorized by law, which <i>certificate itself</i> must be <i>properly</i> authenticated. The <i>proper</i> authentication, under the laws of Virginia, is the <i>testimonial</i> mentioned in the act of assembly, or the <i>great seal</i> of the colony or island.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p18">
<span class="num">18</span>
<p class="indent">3. With regard to the depositions taken on behalf of the defendant, and which the plaintiff wished to use on the trial, they ought not to have been read for the plaintiff, because they had not been taken in such a manner as to authorize the defendant to use them against the plaintiff.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p19">
<span class="num">19</span>
<p class="indent">This court has determined that notice to an attorney at law is not such notice as is required by the act of assembly of Virginia, for taking depositions, and the attorney could not admit, or waive notice but upon record.</p>

</div>
<div class="num" id="p21">
<span class="num">21</span>
<p class="indent">2. As to the copy of the proceedings in the court of vice-admiralty, they took a distinction between the proceedings of municipal courts, and courts of the law of nations. The seals of courts of admiralty, in cases under the law of nations, are admitted in evidence without further authentication, because they are courts of the whole civilized world, and every person interested is a party. 1 <i>Rob.</i> 296. <i>The Maria</i>. <i>Gilb.

<p class="indent">The exception in the policy was not intended merely to exclude the <i>risk</i> of attempting to enter a blockaded port, but excluded <i>all</i> risks if the vessel should sail for a port actually blockaded. The trade with a blockaded port is an illegal trade, and there is an express warranty at the foot of the policy against all losses arising from seizure for or on account of illicit or prohibited trade. The exception, therefore, must have been intended to provide for something else. Can it be contended that if the vessel had sailed for Hispaniola, the underwriters would have been liable for a loss, happening in any manner whatsoever? Yet blockaded ports and Hispaniola are equally excepted, and in the very same words. A voyage to such a port is as much excluded from the policy as a voyage to Hispaniola. The exclusion of particular ports amounts to a warranty that the vessel shall not sail to such ports; and if a warranty be not complied with, the underwriters are not bound, whatever may be the cause of the non-compliance, and whether the loss happened in consequence of such non-compliance, or not. It is a condition precedent; and an innocent, an ignorant, or a compulsive violation of a warranty, however immaterial, avoids the contract of insurance. <i>Park</i>, 318. 326. 363. 369. <i>Marshall</i>, 348. 354.</p>

<p class="indent">MARSHALL, Ch. J. delivered the opinion of the court as follows, viz.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p26">
<span class="num">26</span>
<p class="indent">The material question in this case grows out of an exception in a policy of insurance.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p27">
<span class="num">27</span>
<p class="indent">The plaintiff insured a specified sum on the brig Richard, belonging to the defendant, 'at and from Tobago to one or more ports in the West Indies, and at the from thence to Norfolk;' and the insurance is declared to be made against '<i>all risks</i>, blockaded ports and Hispaniola excepted.'</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p28">
<span class="num">28</span>
<p class="indent">The Richard sailed from Tobago for Curracoa, which was then blockaded in fact, but the blockade was not known at Tobago when the vessel sailed, nor was it known to the captain until he was warned off by a British ship of war. He then sailed for Norfolk; but on his voyage was captured by a French privateer, by whom the vessel was plundered to a considerable extent, and ordered to St. Domingo for trial.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p29">
<span class="num">29</span>
<p class="indent">The question is, whether this risk comes within the exception contained in the policy.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p30">
<span class="num">30</span>
<p class="indent">The counsel has considered the exception as a warranty; but the court cannot so consider it. The words are the words of the insurer, not of the insured; and they take a particular risk out of the policy which, but for the exception, would be comprehended in the contract.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p31">
<span class="num">31</span>
<p class="indent">What is that risk?</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p32">
<span class="num">32</span>
<p class="indent">Policies of insurance are generally the most informal instruments which are brought into courts of justice; and there are no instruments which are more liberally construed, in order to effect the real intention of the parties, if that intention can be clearly ascertained.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p33">
<span class="num">33</span>
<p class="indent">In that part of the policy on which the present controversy depends, a few words are given, to which others must be subjoined in order to complete the sense, and give a full description of the risk against which the underwriters were unwilling to insure. These words are, 'blockaded ports and Hispaniola excepted.'</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p34">
<span class="num">34</span>
<p class="indent">It is reasonable to suppose that a voyage to Hispaniola was not insured. The assured has notice of this, and if he sails for Hispaniola, the voyage is entirely at his own risk. Against the risks of such a voyage, whatever they may be, the underwriters will not insure. It is a specified place, excluded, by consent, from the policy. The perils attending the voyage are understood, whether they arise from the sea, or otherwise, and are all excepted. The motives for making the exception do not appear, nor can they be inferred from the instrument.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p35">
<span class="num">35</span>
<p class="indent">The plaintiff in error contends that the same reasoning applies, in its full extent, to the exception of blockaded ports; but the court does not think so.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p36">
<span class="num">36</span>
<p class="indent">Hispaniola is excepted absolutely from the policy; but other ports are within the terms of the voyage insured, if they be not blockaded. It is their character, as blockaded ports, which excludes them from the insurance. Their being excepted by this character is thought to justify the opinion, that it is the risk attending this character which produces the exception, and which is the risk excepted. The risk of a blockaded port, as a blockaded port, is the risk incurred by breaking the blockade. This is defined by public law. Sailing from Tobago for Curracoa, knowing Curracoa to be blockaded, would have incurred this risk, but sailing for that port, without such knowledge, did not incur it.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p37">
<span class="num">37</span>
<p class="indent">The underwriter had no objection to a voyage to Curracoa, other than might arise from its being blockaded. The dangers of the blockade, therefore, were the particular dangers which induced the exception, and it seems to the court that the exception ought not to be extended beyond them. If this be correct, the circuit court committed no error in refusing to give the opinion which was required by the counsel on this point.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p38">
<span class="num">38</span>
<p class="indent">The sentence in this case is sufficiently authenticated to be received as evidence. Being a court acting under the law of nations, its proceedings may be proved according to the mode observed in the present case; and were this doubtful, that doubt would be removed by the circumstance that it is the form stipulated by treaty.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p39">
<span class="num">39</span>
<p class="indent">The defendant is not at liberty to except to his own depositions, because he does not produce proof of his having given notice to the plaintiff. The admission of notice by the plaintiff is certainly sufficient, if notice to him was necessary, to enable him to use the defendant's deposition.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p40">
<span class="num">40</span>
<p class="indent">The fourth bill of exceptions depends on the principles stated by the court, in the first part of this opinion.</p>

<p class="parties">MOSS<br/>v.<br/>RIDDLE &amp; CO.</p>
<p class="date">February Term, 1809</p>
<div class="prelims">
<p class="indent">ERROR to the circuit court for the district of Columbia, in an action of debt upon the joint bond of Welsh and Moss for the payment of money.</p>
<p class="indent">Welsh, who was the principal debtor, not being found in, and not being an inhabitant of, the district of Columbia, the suit abated as to him.</p>
<p class="indent">The defendant Moss, in his <i>first</i> plea, after protesting that he did not deliver to any person, unconditionally, as his act and deed, the writing in the declaration mentioned, averred that he signed and sealed the same, and delivered it to <i>Joseph Riddle, one of the plaintiffs, as an escrow</i>, to be his act and deed, on condition that the same should afterwards be signed, sealed and delivered by some other friend of Welsh, which was not done, and so the said writing is void as to him the said Moss.</p>
<p class="indent">To this plea the plaintiffs demurred specially; 1st. Because a bond cannot be delivered to the obligee himself as an <i>escrow;</i> 2d. Because the plea does not state by what other friend of Welsh it was to have been executed; 3d. Because it did not state by whom the execution of the bond, by that other friend was to have been procured, leaving it uncertain whether the condition upon which it was to become the deed of Moss was to be performed by him, or by Riddle, or by Welsh; 4. Because the plea is repugnant, inconsistent and informal. The <i>second</i> plea, after protesting as in the first plea, avers, that Riddle came to the defendant and asked him whether Welsh had not applied to him, Moss, to be his security for a debt due to Riddle &amp; Co.; to which Moss replied he had told Welsh he would not be security alone, but would join Welsh and some other friend of his as security for the debt, whereupon Riddle represented that the greatest confidence was placed in Welsh; that the partnership of Riddle &amp; Co. was about to be dissolved; that Riddle would take care to keep that paper, if it was executed, in his dividend of the debts; that Welsh and Moss might sign the bond at that time, and some other person might sign it afterwards; that in regard to the debt he would look only to Welsh, and would also give Welsh a credit for goods, when he, Riddle, should open and commence business on his private and individual account. The plea further avers, that Moss being induced by that representation and promise, did sign, seal and deliver the writing, upon condition that some other friend of the said Welsh should also sign, seal and deliver the same, and not otherwise; which was never done. That Riddle did afterwards carry on trade and merchandise, on his own separate and individual account, but never afterwards credited Welsh with any goods or merchandise; 'and <i>so</i> the said writing made and executed as aforesaid is void as to him the said Robert Moss.'</p>
<p class="indent">To this plea the plaintiff also demurred specially, for the causes stated in the first demurrer; and further, because the plea is multifarious, argumentative, and offers to put in issue a number of matters unconnected with the defence set up, and immaterial in themselves.</p>
<p class="indent">The court below gave judgment for the plaintiffs upon both demurrers.</p>
<p class="indent">Before the judgment was entered by the clerk, the defendant below prayed leave to amend his first plea, by striking out the words 'delivered to Joseph Riddle, one of the plaintiffs in this cause,' and inserting in lieu thereof the words 'placed in the hands of Joseph Riddle, one of the plaintiffs in this cause.' But the court refused leave to make the amendment. To which refusal the defendant excepted.</p>
<p class="indent">Afterwards, and after the court had pronounced judgment in the cause, the defendant moved the court for leave to file an amended plea, which was in all respects like the 2d plea, except that it averred that Riddle stated it to be the rule of the plaintiffs to take specialties for their debts if they could be obtained, and that the bond was delivered to Riddle in the <i>absence of the other plaintiff</i>, and except also that the conclusion was as follows: 'and <i>so</i> the said defendant saith that the said writing, made and executed as aforesaid, was obtained by deception and fraud, <i>as aforesaid</i>, as to him the said Robert Moss, and, by reason of the <i>said</i> deception, is void as to him the said Robert Moss; and this he is ready to verify.' But the court refused to suffer the plea to be filed, being of opinion that it would be bad upon demurrer. To this refusal also the defendant took a bill of exceptions.</p>
<p class="indent"><i>C. Lee</i> and <i>Swann</i>, for the plaintiff in error.</p>
<p class="indent">The plea of escrow was good. An instrument may be delivered to one of the parties as an escrow. <i>Pawling</i> v. <i>United States</i>, in this court.</p>
<p class="indent">It was not delivered to the plaintiffs, but to one of them only. It was not delivered absolutely, but upon condition that it should also be executed by another person also.</p>
<p class="indent">The plea of fraud also was good. It is not necessary to aver <i>fraud</i> in a plea. If the facts themselves show fraud, it is sufficient. Any thing that avoids the deed may be pleaded; and the conclusion, '<i>and so the said writing is void</i>,' is proper and sufficient. It is not necessary to say it is not his deed. 2 <i>Wils.</i> 352. <i>Collins</i> v. <i>Blantern</i>.</p>
<p class="indent"><i>E. J. Lee</i> and <i>Jones</i>, contra.</p>
<p class="indent">An instrument cannot be delivered as an escrow to a party who is to derive benefit under the deed. It must always be to a stranger. <i>Shep. Tough</i>. 55, 56, 57. <i>Hob.</i> 246. 3 <i>Bac. Abr.</i> 320. 694. <i>Esp. N. P.</i> 221.</p>
<p class="indent">The 2d plea is not a plea of fraud. It is an attempt to set up as a discount or set-off against a bond, an unliquidated claim for damages for breach of a promise.</p>
<p class="indent">The facts stated do not amount to fraud. Fraud consists in the intention, the <i>quo animo</i>, which is not averred in the plea; and fraud can never be presumed, especially if it be not averred. 1 <i>Vent.</i> 9. 210. 3 <i>Bac.</i> 320. 1 <i>Fonb.</i></p>
<p class="center"><i>March</i> 13.</p>
<p class="indent">MARSHALL, Ch. J. delivered the opinion of the court to the following effect:</p>
<p class="indent">It is admitted by the counsel in this case, that a bond cannot be delivered to the obligee <i>as an escrow</i>. But it is contended that where there are several obligees constituting a copartnership, it may be delivered as an escrow to one of the firm. The court, however, is of opinion that a delivery to one is a delivery to all. It can never be necessary to the validity of a bond that all the obligees should be convened together at the delivery.</p>
<p class="indent">Upon the other point the counsel for the plaintiff in error has insisted that the plea is sufficient.</p>
<p class="indent">But the court thinks it so radically defective as to be bad even upon general demurrer.</p>
<p class="indent">There is no allegation of fraud, and the circumstances pleaded do not, in themselves, amount to fraud.</p>
<p class="indent">Fraud consists in intention, and that intention is a fact which ought to have been averred, for it is the gist of the plea, and would have been traversable.</p>
<p class="indent">Upon what was the plaintiff below to take issue? Upon all the circumstances stated in the plea which are mere <i>inducement</i>, or upon the conclusion that 'the bond is void?' If he had traversed the inducement, the issue would have been immaterial: if he had traversed the conclusion, it would have been putting in issue to the jury matter of law.</p>
<p class="indent">Judgment affirmed with costs.</p>
<p class="indent"><i>C. Lee</i> suggested that there was also an exception to the refusal of the court to allow an amended plea to be filed, after the court had adjudged the pleas bad.</p>
<p class="indent">But the <i>Chief Justice</i> said that the court had, in an early part of this term,<a class="footnote" href="#fn-s" id="fn-s_ref">*</a> decided that such refusal was no error for which the judgment could be reversed.</p>

<p><span class="star-pagination">*220</span> MARSHALL, Ch. J. The court has been able to form an opinion as to a part only of this case.</p>
<p>That the court as a court of chancery has jurisdiction of such cases, is a point established by a long course of practice in Virginia and in Kentucky; but in the exercise of that jurisdiction, it will proceed according to the principles of equity. In such case, a prior entry will be considered as notice to him <span class="star-pagination">*221</span> who has the legal title, if such entry be sufficiently certain. And the legal title will be considered as holden for him who has the prior equity.</p>
<p>MARSHALL, Ch. J. delivered the opinion of the court as follows:</p>
<p>This is an appeal from a decree of the court for the district of Kentucky, by which Taylor was directed to convey to Bodley and others a part of a tract of land to which he held an elder patent, but to which Bodley and others claim the better right under a junior patent. The judge of the district court having directed such part of the land held by Taylor to be conveyed to Bodley and others, as appeared by certain rules, which he has applied to the case, to be within their claim, and not within Taylor's location, and having dismissed their bill as to the residue, each party has appealed from his decree.</p>
<p>Previous to any discussion of the rights of the parties, it has become necessary to dispose of a preliminary question.</p>
<p>The defendant in the court below objects to the jurisdiction of a court of equity, and contends not only that the present case furnishes no ground of jurisdiction, upon general principles, but that the land law under which both titles originate, in giving a remedy by which rights under entries might be decided previous to the emanation of a patent, has prohibited an examination of the same question after a patent shall have issued.</p>
<p>Had this been a case of the first impression, some contrariety of opinion would perhaps have existed on this point. But it has been sufficiently shown that the practice of resorting to a court of chancery in order to set up an equitable against the legal title, received, in its origin, the sanction of the court of appeals, <span class="star-pagination">*222</span> while Kentucky remained a part of Virginia, and has been so confirmed by an uninterrupted series of decisions as to be incorporated into their system, and to be taken into view in the consideration of every title to lands in that country. Such a principle cannot now be shaken.</p>
<p>But it is an inquiry of vast importance whether, in deciding claims of this description, a court of equity acts upon its known, established and general principles, or is merely substituted for a court of law, with power to decide questions respecting rights under the statute, as they existed previous to the consummation of those rights by patent.</p>
<p>It has been argued that the right acquired by an entry is a legal right, because it is given by a statute, that it is the statutory inception of a legal title which gives to the person making it a right, against every person not having a prior entry, to obtain a patent and to hold the land. The inference drawn from this is, that as the law affords no remedy against a person who has defeated this right by improperly obtaining a prior patent, a court of chancery, which can afford it, ought to consider itself as sitting in the character of a court of law, and ought to decide those questions as a court of law would decide them, if capable of looking beyond the patent.</p>
<p>This reasoning would perhaps be conclusive if a court of chancery was, by statute, substituted in the place of a court of law, with an express grant of jurisdiction in the case. But the jurisdiction exercised by a court of chancery is not granted by statute; it is assumed by itself: and what can justify that assumption but the opinion that cases of this description come within the sphere of its general action? In all cases in which a court of equity takes jurisdiction, it will exercise that jurisdiction upon its own principles. It is believed that no exception to this rule is to be found in the books, and the state of land titles in Kentucky is not believed to furnish one. The true ground of the jurisdiction <span class="star-pagination">*223</span> of a court of equity is, that an entry is considered as a record of which a subsequent locator may have notice, and therefore must be presumed to have it; consequently, although he may obtain the first patent, he is liable, in equity, to the rules which apply to a subsequent purchaser with notice of a prior equitable right. This certainly brings the validity of the entries before the court, but it also brings with that question every other which defeats the equity of the plaintiff.</p>
<p>The court, therefore, will entertain jurisdiction of the cause, but will exercise that jurisdiction in conformity with the settled principles of a court of chancery. It will afford a remedy which a court of law cannot afford, but since that remedy is not given by statute, it will be applied by this court as the principles of equity require its application.</p>
<p>Neither is the compact between Virginia and Kentucky considered as affecting this case.</p>
<p>If the same measure of justice be meted to the citizens of each state, if laws be neither made nor expounded for the purpose of depriving those who are protected by that compact, of their rights, no violation of that compact is perceived.</p>
<p>The court will proceed, then, to inquire into the rights of the parties, and, in making this inquiry, will pay great respect to all those principles which appear to be well established in the state in which the lands in controversy lie.</p>
<p>Taylor holding the eldest patent, it is necessary that the complainants below should found their title on a good entry. The validity of their entry, therefore, is the first subject of examination.</p>
<p>It was made on the 17th of October, 1783, and is in these words; "Henry Crutcher and John Tibbs enter 10,000 acres of land on a treasury warrant, beginning at a large black ash and small buckeye marked thus, I.T. on the side of a buffalo-road <span class="star-pagination">*224</span> leading from the lower blue licks a N.E. course, and about seven miles N.E. by E. from the said blue licks," &amp;c.</p>
<p>The only objection to this entry is, that the beginning is uncertain.</p>
<p>Were the validity of this objection to be admitted, it would shake almost every title in Kentucky. If it be recollected that almost every acre of good land in that state was located at a time when only a few individuals, collected in scattered forts or villages, encroached on the rights of the savages and wild beasts of the country, that neither these sparse settlers, nor those hardy adventurers who travelled thither in quest of lands, could venture out to explore the country, without exposing their lives to imminent hazard, that many of those who had thus explored the country, and who made locations, were unlettered men, not only incapable of expounding the laws, but some of them incapable of reading, it is not wonderful that the courts of Kentucky should have relaxed, in some degree, the rigour of the rule requiring an impracticable precision in making entries, should have laid hold of every circumstance which might afford that certainty which the law has required, and should be content with that reasonable certainty which would enable a subsequent locator, by the exercise of a due degree of judgment and diligence, to locate his own lands on the adjacent residuum.</p>
<p>The entry of Crutcher and Tibbs possesses this reasonable certainty.</p>
<p>The blue licks was a place of general notoriety, and there appears to have been no difficulty in ascertaining the point from which the mensuration should commence. There being only one of the three roads leading from that point, which ran nearly a N.E. course, no subsequent locator could doubt on which road this land was placed. The entry having called for visible objects on the road about <span class="star-pagination">*225</span> seven miles from the licks, those visible objects might be discovered without any extraordinary exertion; and if they could not be discovered, then that call, according to the course of decisions in Kentucky, would be discarded, and about seven miles would be considered as seven miles. But those objects remained, and it appears that no difficulty has arisen, or ought to arise, on this point. The jury have found it to be the beginning called for in the entry.</p>
<p>The entry, therefore, of Crutcher and Tibbs is sufficiently certain, and the court will proceed to examine the entry and survey of Taylor.</p>
<p>This entry being the last link of a chain commencing with Jacob Johnson, it is necessary to fix Jacob Johnson, in order to ascertain the position of Taylor.</p>
<p>Jacob Johnson's title is a settlement and pre-emption; a certificate for which was granted by the commissioners, on the 7th day of January, 1780, in the following terms.</p>
<p>Peter Johnson, heir at law of Jacob Johnson, deceased, this day claimed a settlement and pre-emption to a tract of land in the district of Kentucky, lying on the east side of the buffalo-road leading from the blue licks to <i>Limestone,</i> nine miles from the lick on the upper road, by the said decedent's raising a crop of corn in the year 1776. Satisfactory proof being made to the court, they are of opinion that the said Peter Johnson, &amp;c. has a right to a settlement of 400 acres of land to include the above location, and the pre-emption of 1,000 acres adjoining, and that a certificate issue accordingly.</p>
<p>On the 21st of February, 1780, this certificate, so far as respected the settlement of 400 acres, was entered with the surveyor.</p>
<p>It is the opinion of the court that the 400 acres <span class="star-pagination">*226</span> of land should lie entirely on the east side of the road, that it should begin at the distance of nine miles, and that those miles should be computed not by a straight line, but according to the meanders of the road.</p>
<p>In this respect the court perceives a clear distinction between a call for one place by its distance from another, if the intermediate space be entirely woods, or if a stream, which cannot well be followed, passes from the one to the other, and where a road is called for, which conducts individuals from point to point. The distance of places from each other is not generally computed by a stream not navigable, but is always computed by a road which is travelled. It is, therefore, the opinion of the court that where, as in this case, there is no other call in the entry showing a contrary intent, and the entry is placed on a road at a certain distance from a given point by which the road passes, the distance is to be computed by the meanders of the road, and not by a straight line.</p>
<p>The beginning of Johnson's settlement being found, and its western side being placed along the road, the next inquiry is, in what manner the land is to be surveyed.</p>
<p>In order to give certainty to locations of this description, the courts of Kentucky have uniformly determined that they shall be understood as being made in a square. Johnson's line upon the road, therefore, must extend along the road until two lines at right angles from each end of this base shall, with a third line parallel to the general course of the road, include, in a figure which, if the road be reduced to a straight line, would make a square, the quantity of 400 acres on the east side of the road.</p>
<p>The next link in this chain of entries, on which the title of Taylor depends, is Ambrose Walden's.</p>
<p>On the 22d of May, 1780, Ambrose Walden entered <span class="star-pagination">*227</span> 1,333 acres on the east side of Jacob Johnson's settlement and pre-emption, on the waters of Johnson's fork, a branch of licking, to include two cabins on the north side of said fork, built by Simon Butler, and to run eastwardly for quantity.</p>
<p>The cabins, it is said, cannot be found; or, if found, cannot be distinguished. The waters of Johnson's fork would be too vague, and, therefore, the validity of this entry must depend on the call for Johnson's settlement and pre-emption.</p>
<p>This is said to be insufficient, because the pre-emption had not, at that time, been located with the surveyor, and the certificate of the commissioners was no location. Johnson's pre-emption, therefore, had, on the 22d of May, 1780, no locality, a subsequent entry could not depend upon it; for it might be placed in any situation, or in any form, provided it be so placed as to adjoin his settlement in any point.</p>
<p>The argument with respect to the pre-emption appears to the court to be conclusive. This pre-emption right certainly had no locality on the 22d of May, 1780, and an entry made to depend entirely on it would have been too vague, too uncertain, to be maintained. But it does not follow that the entry of Ambrose Walden is void. He does not call singly for the pre-emption, he calls for "the east side of Johnson's settlement and pre-emption right;" and it seems to the court that a fair application of the principles which have governed in Kentucky in similar cases, will maintain this location.</p>
<p>The settlement was actually located; the pre-emption, at the time, had no other than a potential existence; and the uniform course of decisions appears to have been to discard one call which is either impossible or uncertain, and to support the entry, if there be other calls which are sufficiently certain. The decisions have gone so far as to dismiss a part of the description of a single call, if other terms of <span class="star-pagination">*228</span> description be sufficient to ascertain the thing called for. Now the call for the settlement right is valid and certain; and the court is not of opinion that this certainty is rendered uncertain by being united to the call for a pre-emption which had no real existence.</p>
<p>The call appears to be substantially the same as if it had been for the land of Johnson. His settlement and pre-emption was perhaps the name which, in common parlance, designated this land even before the location of the pre-emption, because it was appendant to the settlement. It has been decided that a call for the land would be good, and the court thinks that decision applicable to this case.</p>
<p>Against this has been urged the doubt which a subsequent locator would have entertained at the time, whether Johnson might not have been permitted to locate his pre-emption on any land adjoining his settlement, and whether Walden's entry calling for that pre-emption might be decided to be good, and to be placed so as to bind upon it. This doubt, it is said, though now removed, then existed, and would have operated on the mind of the subsequent locator.</p>
<p>The force of this argument will not be denied. But it must also be admitted that it applies with equal strength to the course of artificial reasoning which has governed the decisions of the courts of Kentucky, and on which the titles of the people of that country depend. Subsequent locators must have doubted in what manner any of these questions would be decided. But having been decided, the certainty which they have introduced is carried back to the time when the location was made, and affirms that location.</p>
<p>It has also been said that it is uncertain which side of Johnson's settlement is the east side, and that, in point of fact, the upper side, or that furthest <span class="star-pagination">*229</span> from the blue licks, faces the east more nearly than any other.</p>
<p>However this fact may be, the court is of opinion that the terms of Johnson's entry designate his east side. His settlement is to lie on the east side of the road. The road, then, in contemplation of the locator, forms the west side, and the side opposite the road must be the east side. The entry must have been so understood by all subsequent locators, and when they call for his east side, the intention to place themselves on the side opposite the road is sufficiently intelligible.</p>
<p>In this, as in other difficulties which occur in the course of the inquiry, it is material to observe that the bill does not charge Taylor's entry to be void for uncertainty. On the contrary it impliedly admits the certainty of his location, and charges that his survey does not conform to it. The real question, then, is not whether Taylor shall be surveyed at all, but where he shall be placed.</p>
<p>The entry of Ambrose Walden, then, will lie on the east side of Johnson's settlement, that is, on the side opposite the road; and, this point being established, the manner in which his land is to be surveyed is free from further doubt. It is to be laid off in a square, the centre of the base line of which is to be the centre of the south-eastern line of Johnson's settlement.</p>
<p>The next entry to be considered is that of John Walden. He enters 1,666 2-3 acres joining Ambrose Walden, on the south and south-east, and to run east and south-east for quantity.</p>
<p>Although Ambrose Walden has no south side, yet it is sufficiently apparent that his south-west side was intended by the locator. The difficulty arises from the subsequent call of the entry to run east and south-east for quantity. A line drawn east from Ambrose Walden's south-western corner would pass <span class="star-pagination">*230</span> through the middle of his land, and a line drawn south-east from the same corner would pass either through or so near his land as to make it almost impossible to suppose that the locator could have intended to make so long and narrow a triangle. The reasonable partiality of Kentucky for rectangular figures must, therefore, decide the shape of John Walden's land, and regulate the manner in which this call of his entry is to be understood. Ambrose Walden's north-western line must be extended to the south, and a line must be drawn due east from his eastern corner, so that a line parallel to his south-eastern line intersecting a line drawn south-east from the extremity of the north-western line of Ambrose Walden continued shall lay off 1,666 2-3 acres of land in equal quantities on the northern and south-eastern sides of Ambrose.</p>
<p>It is not to be disguised that there is much difficulty in placing John Walden, but the court can perceive no mode of placing him more conformable to the principles which prevail in Kentucky than that which it has adopted.</p>
<p>We are now brought to Taylor's entry.</p>
<p>On the 22d of May, 1780, John Taylor enters 3,000 acres adjoining John Walden on the north side of Johnson's fork of licking, on the east and south-east side, running up and down said creek, and north for quantity, to include an improvement made by Jacob Drennon and Simon Butler.</p>
<p>There is to John Walden's land no east side, nor any side so nearly east as the south-east side. The word side, being in the singular number, and the same side answering, better than any other, both parts of the description, the land must lie on the south-east side.</p>
<p>It is also thought to be the more reasonable construction of the entry that the words, on the north side of Johnson's fork, refer to the situation of <span class="star-pagination">*231</span> John Walden's land, not to the location of Taylor's. But this is probably not important in the case. Taylor is to lie on the south-east of Walden, to include an improvement made by Drennon and Butler, to run up and down the creek, and north for quantity.</p>
<p>With these calls, it would have been the opinion of the court that Taylor could not cross the creek, had not his entry called for an object on the south side of the creek. That object is the improvement made by Jacob Drennon and Simon Butler.</p>
<p>It has been said that the country was covered with cabins, and that therefore this call was no designation of the land that was located. This argument is correct so far as it is urged to prove that this would not be sufficient, as a general description, to enable subsequent locators to say in what part of the country this entry was made. Neither would the letters I.T. marked on a tree answer this purpose. But, when brought into the neighbourhood by other parts of the description, these letters serve to ascertain the beginning of the entry under which the claim adversary to that of Taylor is supported. So Taylor informs subsequent locators of the neighbourhood in which his land lies, by calling for the south-east side of John Walden's entry, on the north of Johnson's fork, which is found by a reference to other entries which commence at a point of public notoriety. When brought to the south-east side of John Walden, he is near the cabin called for, and it does not appear that there was, in the neighbourhood, any other cabin which this entry could possibly be understood to include. This part of the description, then, will carry Taylor to the south side of Johnson's fork, and, if permitted to cross that fork, the favourite figure of the square must be resorted to. Against this it is said that, in such a case, the rule of Kentucky will carry him no further than barely to include the object of his call. But this rule cannot apply to this case, because it would give a survey the breadth of which would not be one third of its length.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*232</span> It is impossible to look at the general plat returned in this case without feeling a conviction that the surveyor considered that fork which, in the plat, is termed mud lick fork, as Johnson's fork; and there is no testimony in the cause which shows that, when this location was made, that middle stream which runs through Taylor's survey was denominated Johnson's fork. The finding of the jury, however, that the roads and water-courses are rightly laid down, must induce the opinion that this fact was proved to them.</p>
<p>In a case where the mistake is so obvious, the rule which, under circumstances so doubtful, relative to place, deprives the person, in surveying whose property the mistake has been made, of his legal title, appears to be a severe rule to be adopted in a court of equity. But such is the situation of land titles in Kentucky, that the rule must be inflexible.</p>
<p>Taylor, then, must adjoin John Walden on his south-east side, where that line crosses Johnson's fork, if it does cross it, and if it does not, then at its south-eastern extremity, which will be nearest Johnson's fork. If a square formed upon the whole line shall contain less than three thousand acres, then two lines are to be extended due north until, with a line running east and west, the quantity of three thousand acres shall be contained in the whole figure. If such a square shall contain more than three thousand acres, then it is to be laid off on so much of Walden's line as to contain the exact quantity.</p>
<p>This being the manner in which it appears to the court that Taylor's entry ought to be surveyed, it remains to inquire whether, under the principles which govern a court of equity in affording its aid to an equitable against a legal title, the complainants below ought to recover any, and, if any, what part of the lands surveyed by Taylor, and, if any, what terms are to be imposed upon them.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*233</span> The entry as well as patent of Taylor is prior to that under which the complainants in the district court assert their title. Of the entries made within their location, therefore, they had that implied notice which gives a court of equity jurisdiction of this cause. They cannot object to the operation of a principle which enables them to come into court. But, in addition to this principle, they must be considered as having notice, in fact, of these locations. The position of the entries of both plaintiffs and defendant is ascertained by calling for certain distances along the same road from the same object. Crutcher and Tibbs, therefore, when they made their location, knew well that they included the Waldens and Taylor, and that their entry could give them no pretensions to the lands previously entered by those persons. If, by any inadvertence, the Waldens and Taylor have surveyed land to which Crutcher and Tibbs were entitled, and have left to Crutcher and Tibbs land to which the Waldens and Taylor were entitled, it would seem to the court to furnish no equity to Crutcher and Tibbs against the legal title which is held by their adversaries, unless they will submit to the condition of restoring the lands they have gained by the inadvertence of which they complain.</p>
<p>The court does not liken this inadvertent survey of lands, not within the location, to withdrawing of the warrant and re-entering it in another place. The latter is the act of the mind intentionally abandoning an entry once made: the former is no act of the mind, and so far from evidencing an intention to abandon, discovers an intention to adhere to the appropriation once made. Although their legal effect may be the same, yet they are not the same with a person who has gained by the inadvertence, and applies to a court of equity to increase that gain.</p>
<p>Was this, then, a case of the first impression, the court would strongly incline to the opinion <span class="star-pagination">*234</span> that Bodley and Hughes ought not to receive a conveyance for the lands within Taylor's survey, and not within his entry, but on the condition of their consenting to convey to him the lands they hold which were within his entry and are not included in his survey. But this is not a case of the first impression. The court is compelled to believe that the principle is really settled in a manner different from that which this court would deem correct. It is impossible to say how many titles might be shaken by shaking the principle. The very extraordinary state of land title in that country has compelled its judges, in a series of decisions, to rear up an artificial pile from which no piece can be taken, by hands not intimately acquainted with the building, without endangering the structure, and producing a mischief to those holding under it, the extent of which may not be perceived. The rule as adopted must be pursued.</p>
<p>Taylor, then, must be surveyed according to the principles laid down in this decree, and must convey to the plaintiffs below the lands lying within his patent and theirs, which were not within his entry.</p>

<p><span class="star-pagination">*267</span> <i>Swann</i> and <i>P.B. Key,</i> for the appellants.</p>
<p><i>E.J. Lee</i> and <i>C. Lee,</i> for the appellee.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*270</span> MARSHALL, Ch. J. delivered the opinion of the court as follows, viz.</p>
<p>By the agreement of the 27th of September, 1799, the plaintiffs bound themselves, in the event of not paying, on the 2d of January, in bills of exchange, or money, the amount of the award to be rendered between the parties, to assign and transfer, on that day, to the defendant, a contract they had made with Graham, by which they had sold to him a tract of land containing 6,000 acres for the sum of 18,000 <span class="star-pagination">*271</span> dollars, payable at different times, with interest. They also bound themselves to execute an irrevocable power of attorney enabling the defendant, in their names, to recover the possession of the land, or to enforce the payment of the purchase-money, at his election.</p>
<p>The defendant covenanted to accept this assignment, <i>towards</i> the discharge of the award, and, if it should exceed the amount thereof, to pay the excess.</p>
<p>On the part of the defendant it has been contended that this assignment was to be received as security for, and not as payment of, the debt due to Dunlop &amp; Co. But on this point it is impossible to entertain a doubt. The contract itself is conclusive. The word "<i>towards</i>" was obviously introduced because, the award not being then made, it was uncertain whether the assignment would completely discharge its amount. But the words of the agreement admit of no other construction than that it was to be received either in part or in full payment, as the sum awarded might be of a greater or less amount than the stipulated value of the contract to be assigned. All the testimony connected with the agreement of September, 1799, tends to confirm this construction.</p>
<p>The next inquiry respects the transactions of the 2d of January, 1800. The plaintiffs insist, and the defendant denies, that the tender made by Hepburn and Dundas on that day was a legal offer to do what they had covenanted to perform.</p>
<p>The efficacy of the assignment itself is not questioned; but it is contended on the part of the defendant that the instrument is vitiated by the clause which is introduced into it, reciting, as a part of the consideration on which it was made, that a release of all claims and demands whatsoever, on the part of John Dunlop &amp; Co. against them, had been given.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*272</span> The contract of September, 1799, certainly does not, in terms, stipulate for such a release; and if this recital in the deed of assignment could possibly prejudice John Dunlop &amp; Co. that circumstance would unquestionably invalidate the tender. But if it should be deemed an unimportant recital, then the tender is a substantial performance of the contract, so far as it was to be performed on the 2d of January, 1800, and at least imposed on Colin Auld the duty of preparing an unexceptionable deed, and demanding its execution.</p>
<p>It has already been stated that, under the agreement of September, 1799, the assignment of Graham's contract was to be received in payment, and consequently that assignment, accompanied with a proper power of attorney, would discharge the award as fully as a payment in bills of exchange or money. Had the deed, therefore, limited its recital to a discharge of all claims and demands under the award, it would have been strictly correct; for to such a discharge Hepburn and Dundas were entitled. The deed of assignment, properly executed and received, and the power of attorney would, in law, have been a full payment of the award; and the subsequent claims of John Dunlop &amp; Co. would grow out of the agreement of September, 1799.</p>
<p>The inquiry, whether the general terms of the recital affords any substantial objection to the deed, produces two questions.</p>
<p>1. Could John Dunlop &amp; Co. have had any other claims and demands on Hepburn and Dundas, than were comprehended in this award?</p>
<p>2. Would this recital in the deed of assignment impair those claims which grew out of the agreement?</p>
<p>1. The papers themselves sufficiently show that every claim whatever of John Dunlop &amp; Co. on Hepburn and Dundas was settled in the award. The <span class="star-pagination">*273</span> general complexion of the agreement of September, 1799, proves this; but the particular stipulation to give "a full receipt and discharge of all claims and demands of John Dunlop &amp; Co. against them," in the event of payment of the award being made in money or bills of exchange, places the subject beyond any doubt. Dunlop &amp; Co. had no claims and demands on Hepburn and Dundas, which were not settled in the award.</p>
<p>2. Could this recital impair the rights of Dunlop &amp; Co. under the agreement of 1799?</p>
<p>The covenants of that agreement which were not completely satisfied were, 1st. That Hepburn and Dundas would not, after executing the deed of assignment, interfere with the measures which Colin Auld might think proper to pursue for the recovery of either the land sold to Graham, or the money due under Graham's contract; 2d. That they would convey the said lands in fee-simple, after the termination of the suit then depending, to the person who should be decided to be entitled to them.</p>
<p>1. The covenant not to interfere was not a present duty. The obligation it created did not come into existence until after the execution of the deed of assignment. It was to be a consequence of that deed. At the time of its execution, this was not a claim or a demand. Taking the words in their most literal sense, the covenant not to interfere would not, in the opinion of the court, be released by them: but the court is also of opinion that, if this was in any degree doubtful, these general terms would be restrained by the manifest intent of the parties, apparent on the face of the papers.</p>
<p>2. This release could not discharge the obligation to convey the lands, after the termination of the suit with Graham, for the reasons assigned against the foregoing objection, and for this additional reason; the deed intended to transfer to <span class="star-pagination">*274</span> Auld all the rights of Graham under the contract, and is so expressed; and one of the covenants in the contract assigned was, to make a conveyance with a general warranty of a title free from all encumbrances.</p>
<p>The recital, then, presents no solid objection to the deed of assignment, because it could not impair the rights of Dunlop &amp; Co. Yet it is unusual and unnecessary, and had Colin Auld prepared a deed which was perfectly unexceptionable, and Hepburn and Dundas had refused to execute it, this court, although the tender might have been good at law, would probably have held them responsible for any injury which might have been sustained in consequence of such refusal.</p>
<p>The power of attorney, which was tendered at the same time with the deed of assignment, appears entirely unexceptionable.</p>
<p>It is, then, the opinion of the court that, on the 2d of January, 1800, Hepburn and Dundas offered to do every thing which it was at that time incumbent on them to do; and that the tender made on that day, with the refusal of that tender, do in law amount to a performance, so far as to place Hepburn and Dundas in the same situation, with regard to the claims of Dunlop &amp; Co. under the award, as if Colin Auld had accepted the deed. This, however, did not discharge them form the duty of executing a proper deed when required, nor from the duty of making conveyances for the land which was the subject of the agreement of September, 1799.</p>
<p>If a doubt existed on this point, the subsequent conduct of Colin Auld would, in a court of equity, amount to a waiver of the day, so far as respects the tender of the deed, and a consent to accept such deed at an after day within a reasonable time.</p>
<p>The subsequent demand of a deed by Colin Auld, when he tendered the money which was due on account <span class="star-pagination">*275</span> of the excess of value in the estimated price of the land over the sum awarded to John Dunlop &amp; Co. was made in a manner, and under circumstances, which are not deemed reasonable. Hepburn and Dundas had a right to consider and to take counsel on the deed they were required to execute; and although their delay was unnecessarily great, yet the offer they made might have been acceded to. In fact, they might reasonably insist on leaving the transaction on the ground on which it was placed by the contract of September, 1799, which would have been done in a manner free from all exception by executing such a deed as that tendered on the 2d of January, 1800, after striking out that part of the recital which respected the release.</p>
<p>The interference of Hepburn and Dundas, in accommodating the suit with Graham, is also urged as an objection to their conduct. They had certainly no right to interfere without the consent of Colin Auld. But when the correspondence is inspected, and it is perceived that they interfered only to effect the object he had himself desired, and which he had avowed his own inability to effect without their consent, the interference must be considered as innocent in point of intention, and unproductive of injury in fact.</p>
<p>The court, then, perceive nothing in the conduct of the plaintiffs, up to the decision of the suit with Graham, which ought to defeat their right to demand a specific performance of this contract. Could they at that time have conveyed a good title, Colin Auld ought to have accepted it.</p>
<p>It is alleged that the title, sold by the heirs of West to Hepburn and Dundas, was not a title to 6,000 acres of land in severalty, but an undivided interest in a much larger tract, and that, as this purchase was made, not for the purpose of acquiring an estate, but for the purpose of immediately selling and paying a debt which Auld was authorized to collect, the time of executing the contract is very material.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*276</span> It is not to be denied that circumstances may tender the time material; and the court does not decide that this case is not of that description. But the majority of the court is of opinion, that the estate is to be considered as an estate held in severalty.</p>
<p>That a complete partition was made by an agreement, binding on all the parties who were interested, is in full proof. This partition would unquestionably have been protected in equity, and the majority of the court conceive that after such a lapse of time, and such a long separate possession, a deed of partition ought to be presumed; and that the court, in which the verdict in the ejectment against Graham was found, might so have directed the jury.</p>
<p>It remains, then, only to inquire whether Hepburn and Dundas hold a title under West, which is so free from exception that the defendant ought to be decreed to take it.</p>
<p>Long previous to the contract with Colin Auld, Hepburn and Dundas had obtained deeds from all the devisees of John West, jun. who were entitled to undivided parts of the 6,000 acres lying on the Ohio. But the deeds from Thomas West, and Hugh West, were not recorded, and the privy examination of Mrs. Bronaugh, one of the devisees, does not appear. By her deed, therefore, nothing passed, and the deeds of Thomas and Hugh West were liable to very serious objections.</p>
<p>Had Colin Auld refused to receive a conveyance from Hepburn and Dundas after the termination of Graham's suit, because they were unable to make a good title, the objection would certainly have been entitled to very serious consideration. But his rejection of the conveyance then offered was not induced by any defect in the title. He previously determined not to receive a conveyance, because Graham's contract had not been assigned in such manner as he conceived to be a full execution of <span class="star-pagination">*277</span> the agreement of September, 1799. These omissions, then, to record the deeds of Thomas and Hugh West, and the total want of title as to Mrs. Bronaugh's part, have produced no real inconvenience to Colin Auld. Had the title been unexceptionable, it would still have been refused; and this contest would still have been carried on with the same determined perseverance which marks the conduct of the parties. Under these circumstances, it is the opinion of the majority of the court, that this case ought to be governed by those general principles which regulate the conduct of a court of chancery in decreeing a specific performance, if the defect of title, which existed at the time of contract, be cured before the <i>decree.</i></p>
<p>Are Hepburn and Dundas now able to convey a perfect title?</p>
<p>Mrs. Bronaugh and Mrs. Turner, two of the devisees of John West, jun. are dead. On the death of Mrs. Bronaugh, her real estate descended on her brothers and sisters, who were her coheirs. Deeds of confirmation from Hugh and John West, and from Dade and wife have been obtained. Thomas West joined in the deed from Bronaugh and wife for the purpose of releasing his supposed reversion; but there is no conveyance from Francina Turner.</p>
<p>The court is not satisfied that Thomas West, by uniting in the deed for the purpose of conveying his reversionary interest, has conveyed a title which afterwards descended on him, or has estopped himself from asserting that title. To Thomas West's part of Mrs. Bronaugh's 1,000 acres, then, Hepburn and Dundas have no title.</p>
<p>On the death of Francina Turner, her interest in her sister Bronaugh's estate, passed to her brothers and sister, who were her coheirs. To Thomas West's share Hepburn and Dundas have no title.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*278</span> The undivided interest of Thomas West, which descended on him, at the death of Mrs. Bronaugh, is 166 2-3 acres; and the undivided interest which descended on him, at the death of Francina Turner, is 41 1-3 acres; making 208 acres, to which Hepburn and Dundas have, at this time, no title.</p>
<p>The omission to record the deed from Thomas West is not cured; and this court is now to decide whether, under these circumstances, Hepburn and Dundas are entitled to claim a specific performance.</p>
<p>Had there been simply a deficiency of 208 acres, the majority of the court would have considered it as a case for compensation; or had the parties entitled to this land been before the court, a division might possibly have been directed, and compensation for that quantity ordered: but, however this might be, as persons not before the court hold this interest, no order can be made respecting it; and it may very much embarrass those acts for asserting the title which may possibly be necessary. The part actually conveyed by Thomas West, too, never having been confirmed by a deed from himself or his heirs, properly recorded, might impose on Colin Auld the necessity of bringing a suit in chancery to perfect his title; or of being subjected to the inconveniences constantly attending the establishment of a deed not recorded, and the risks inseparable from such a deed.</p>
<p>This, therefore, is thought by a majority of the court to be a case not proper for a specific performance; <i>and the bill is to be dismissed.</i></p>
<p>LIVINGSTON, J. expressed his non-concurrence in the reasoning of the court, in the latter part of the opinion just delivered by the chief justice. He would dismiss the bill, even if a good title could now be given by the complainants. This court can no more dispense with punctuality <i>as to time</i> in any case, than with any other part of the <span class="star-pagination">*279</span> agreement. But in this particular case, time was of the essence of the contract. The object was payment of a debt; and from the anxiety of the defendant to resist a decree for a conveyance, and the desire of the complainants to urge it upon him, it is to be presumed that the lands have fallen in value during this delay of the title. The remedy by a decree for a specific performance is a departure from common law, and ought to be granted only in cases where the party who seeks it has strictly entitled himself to it. It is said that by the English authorities, the lapse of time may be disregarded in equity, in decreeing a specific execution of a contract for land. But there is a vast difference between contracts for land in that country and in this. There the lands have a known, fixed, and stable value. Here the price is continually fluctuating and uncertain. A single day often makes a great difference; and in almost every case time is a very material circumstance.</p>
<p>He dissented also from another part of the opinion, which intimates that if this were simply a deficiency of a few hundred acres, it would be considered as a case of <i>compensation.</i> This part of the opinion does not seem to be necessary, and does not affect the present case; but this court can in no case compel a specific performance on terms and conditions. We cannot decree a special execution for part, and assess damages as to the residue.</p>
<p>This is like a contract for 5,000 bushels of wheat. A tender of 4,500 would not be good; and we could not compel the purchaser to take a less quantity than he contracted for. So here the contract was for 6,000 acres. The complainants have a title to a part only; we could not compel the defendant to take that part, and give him damages for the non-conveyance of the residue.</p>
<p>JOHNSON, J. observed, that he had perhaps taken a peculiar view of this subject, but he should be in favour of decreeing a specific performance generally; <span class="star-pagination">*280</span> leaving Auld to his remedy upon the warranty of the complainants for any defect of title which might appear. Auld, perhaps, thought it would be a good speculation, and had stipulated for a general warranty.</p>
<p>He acquiesced, however, in dismissing the bill, because he considered the judgment in the action at law brought by Auld against the complainants, as equivalent to a decree for a specific execution of the agreement, inasmuch as it prevents him from obtaining satisfaction in any other way for the sum awarded.</p>
<p>MARSHALL, Ch. J. declared the opinion of the court, <i>in the action at law,</i> to be, that the tender of the assignment of Graham's contract, and the power of attorney, was good as pleaded, and that Auld ought to have accepted it.</p>
<p>Judgment reversed.</p>

<p class="date">February Term, 1809</p>
<div class="prelims">
<p class="indent">ERROR to the circuit court of the district of Columbia, in a case of seizure of certain merchandise, being part of the cargo of the schooner Sea Flower, Matthew Keene, claimant, imported from the Havanna, in the island of Cuba, into the port of Vienna, in the district of Maryland, the vessel having sailed on a <i>foreign</i> voyage under a <i>coasting</i> license. The goods having been landed at Vienna, were transported to Alexandria, in the district of Columbia, where they were seized by the collector of that port, and libelled and condemned in the district court of that district, whose sentence was affirmed by the circuit court.</p>
<p class="indent"><i>Swann</i> and <i>Martin</i>, for the plaintiff in error, contended,</p>
<p class="indent">That there was no law which authorized the seizure, or the trial and condemnation out of the district into which the goods had been first imported.</p>
<p class="indent">The goods were condemned under the 8th section of the act of congress, 'for enrolling and licensing ships or vessels to be employed in the coasting trade and fisheries, and for regulating the same,' <i>passed February</i> 18, 1793, <i>vol.</i> 2.<i>p.</i> 174. which enacts, 'that if any ship or vessel, enrolled or licensed as aforesaid, shall proceed on a foreign voyage without first giving up her enrolment and license to the collector of the district comprehending the port from which she is about to proceed on such foreign voyage, and being duly registered by such collector, every such ship or vessel, together with her tackle, apparel and furniture, and the goods, wares and merchandise so imported therein, shall be liable to seizure and forfeiture.'</p>
<p class="indent">By this act the forfeiture arises upon <i>importation</i>. The importation was complete at <i>Vienna</i>, in the <i>district of Maryland</i>, where only the trial can be lawfully had.</p>
<p class="indent">By the 35<i>th section of the act</i>, it is enacted, 'that all penalties and forfeitures which shall be incurred by virtue and force of this act, shall and may be sued for, prosecuted and recovered in like manner as penalties and forfeitures incurred by virtue of the act entitled 'An act to regulate the collection of the duties imposed by law on goods, wares and merchandise, imported into the United States, and on the tonnage of ships or vessels,' may be sued for, prosecuted and recovered, and shall be appropriated in like manner.'</p>
<p class="indent">There is no act in the statute book with such a title. The only act <i>then</i> in force regulating the collection of duties on goods imported, and on tonnage, was the act of <i>August</i>, 4, 1790, entitled 'An act to provide more effectually for the collection of the duties imposed by law on goods, wares and merchandise, imported into the United States, and on the tonnage of ships or vessels.'</p>
<p class="indent">By the 67th section of this act, it is enacted, 'that all <i>penalties</i> accruing by any breach of this act shall be sued for, with costs of suit, in the name of the United States of America, in any court proper to try the same, <i>and the trial of any fact which may be put in issue, shall be within the judicial district in which any such</i> PENALTY <i>shall have</i> ACCRUED; and the collector, within whose district the seizure shall be made, is hereby authorized and directed to cause <i>suits</i> for the same to be commenced and prosecuted to effect, and to receive, distribute and pay the <i>sum</i> or <i>sums</i> recovered, after first deducting all necessary costs and and charges, according to law. And that all <i>ships</i> or <i>vessels, goods, wares</i> or <i>merchandise</i>, which shall become <i>forfeited</i> by virtue of this act, shall be <i>seized, libelled</i> and <i>prosecuted</i> AS AFORESAID in the <i>proper court having cognisance thereof,' &amp;c.</i></p>
<p class="indent">Here the words '<i>as aforesaid</i>' refer to the trial of the fact in the judicial district where the forfeiture was incurred.</p>
<p class="indent">This provision is also analogous to that contained in the 8th amendment of the constitution of the United States, which provides for the trial of all offences in the state and district where they were committed.</p>
<p class="indent">The property could not lawfully be seized out of the district of Vienna, unless by the collector of that port. But if the collector of Alexandria had a right to seize it, he ought to have sent it back to the district of Maryland for trial.</p>
<p class="indent">Congress need not have recited the title of the act to which they intended to refer, but having undertaken to do so, and not having recited it truly, it is as if no mode of trial had been provided; so that there is no court competent to condemn the property.</p>
<p class="indent"><i>Rodney, Attorney-General of the United States, contra</i>.</p>
<p class="indent">The act referred to in the 35th section of the act of the 18th of February, 1793, is the act of the 31st of July, 1789, entitled 'An act to regulate the collection of the duties imposed by law on the tonnage of ships or vessels, and on goods, wares and merchandises imported into the United States.' This act is not in the common edition of the laws, having been repealed by the act of the 4<i>th August</i>, 1790; but it is found in <i>Oswald's edit. of the Laws, vol.</i> 1. <i>p.</i> 25.</p>
<p class="indent">The title contains precisely the same words with the title recited in the 35th section of the act of the 18th of February, 1793. They are a little transposed, but the sense is the same. Whereas the title of the act of the 4<i>th August</i>, 1790, varies very essentially from the title recited. It is 'An act <i>to provide more effectually for the collection of</i> the duties,' &amp;c.</p>
<p class="indent">It is no objection that the act of the 31<i>st of July</i>, 1789, was repealed before the act of the 18<i>th of February</i>, 1793, was passed. It remained in the statute book, and answered every purpose of reference as to the mode of recovering forfeitures, as well as if it had remained in force as a law respecting the collection of duties. It was referred to merely to prevent the necessity of transcribing its provisions respecting a particular subject.</p>
<p class="indent">But even the act of the 4<i>th of August</i>, 1790, <i>section</i> 67 does not require the trial of <i>forfeitures</i> to be in the district where the cause of forfeiture arose. It only declares that in actions for <i>penalties</i>, (not in suits for forfeitures,) 'the trial of any <i>fact</i> which may be put in issue, shall be within the judicial district in which such <i>penalty</i> shall have accrued.' But when it speaks of <i>forfeitures</i>, it says the goods, &amp;c. 'shall be <i>seized, libelled</i> and <i>prosecuted</i> as aforesaid, in <i>the proper</i> court having cognisance thereof;' which are precisely the same words with those contained in the 36th section of the act of the 31<i>st of July</i>, 1789.</p>
<p class="indent">It was not necessary by the common law that prosecutions on penal laws should be in the counties where the offences were committed. 3 <i>Inst.</i> 194. And the stat. of 21 <i>Jac. c.</i> 4. making it necessary in general cases, does not apply to <i>revenue cases.</i> 1 <i>Anst.</i> 220, 221. In such cases, when the proceedings are <i>in rem</i>, the place of seizure always designates the place of trial; and the <i>thing</i> must always be within the jurisdiction and power of the court where the trial is had, otherwise it can neither enforce a sale after condemnation, nor restore the goods upon a decree of restitution. It is said that the collector of Alexandria ought to have sent the goods back to the district of Maryland, for trial. But at whose risk and expense should they be transported? No provision is made by law for such a case. If he had sent the goods back to Maryland, and upon trial they had been acquitted, would the government take the risk and expense of retransportation to Alexandria? Nothing could be more unreasonable and inconvenient.</p>
<p class="indent">But if the act of the 18<i>th of February</i>, 1793, refers neither to the act of <i>July</i> 31, 1789, nor to that of the 4<i>th of August</i>, 1790, there is no mode of prosecution particularly specified in the act of 1793, and the question of jurisdiction must be decided by the judiciary act of September 24, 1789, the 9th section of which enacts that the district courts of the United States shall have exclusive original cognisance of all seizures under the laws of impost, <i>navigation</i>, or trade of the United States, where the seizures are made on certain waters, or on land, <i>within their respective districts</i>, as well as upon the high seas.</p>
<p class="indent">The collector of Alexandria not only had a right, but it was made his duty to seize the goods under the 70th section of the collection law of 1799. <i>Vol.</i> 4. <i>p.</i> 390. But whether the collector had a right to seize or not, the seizure having been made, it was the duty of the court to take cognisance of it.</p>
<p class="center"><i>March</i> 15.</p>
<p class="indent">LIVINGSTON, J. delivered the opinion of the court as follows, viz.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p1">
<span class="num">1</span>
<p class="indent">This is a seizure on land, by the collector of the port of Alexandria, for a breach of the act for enrolling and licensing ships or vessels to be employed in the coasting trade and fisheries, and for regulating the same, passed 18th February, 1793.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p2">
<span class="num">2</span>
<p class="indent">The breach alleged is, that a certain schooner called the Sea Flower, duly enrolled and licensed, sailed to a foreign port, without having first given up her enrolment and license, and without being duly registered. That, on her return voyage, there were imported in the said schooner, from the Havanna into the port of Vienna, in the district of Maryland, certain goods, and thence transported to the town of Alexandria, in the district of Columbia, and within the collection district of Alexandria. The goods were condemned by the circuit court, and the only error relied on is, that there is no law authorizing a condemnation in a district different from that in which the forfeiture accrued.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p3">
<span class="num">3</span>
<p class="indent">The 35th section of the act under which the seizure was made, declares that all penalties, incurred thereby, shall be sued for in the same manner as penalties incurred by virtue of an act entitled 'An act to regulate the collection of the duties imposed by law on goods, wares and merchandises imported into the United States, and on the tonnage of ships or vessels.'</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p4">
<span class="num">4</span>
<p class="indent">On examining the different acts of congress on this subject, there is none whose title exactly corresponds with the reference here made. It is contended by the counsel for the United States, that the act here intended, although it does not bear, in terms, the same title, is the one regulating duties, which passed the 31st of July, 1789, and that this does not render it necessary that the trial should be within the district where the forfeiture accrued; while the plaintiff insists that, as this act had been repealed several years prior to the passing of the law under which this seizure was made, it is more probable that a reference was intended to another act, on the same subject, of the 4th of August, 1790, which requires that the trial of any fact which may be put in issue shall be within the judicial district in which any penalty shall have accrued. It is not improbable that this was the law intended; but as the title of neither corresponds with the one given in this act, the court thinks that the proceedings on forfeitures accruing under it, may well be governed by the 9th section of the act to establish the judicial courts of the United States, which confers, on the district courts, jurisdiction of all seizures under laws of impost, navigation, or trade of the United States, when the seizures are made on waters which are navigable from the sea, by vessels of ten or more tons burden, <i>within their respective districts;</i> and also of all seizures on land, or other waters, than as aforesaid made, and of all suits for penalties and forfeitures incurred under the laws of the United States. It is a fair construction of this section, taking the whole together, that nothing more is necessary to give jurisdiction in cases of this nature, than that the seizure should be within the district, without any regard to the place where the forfeiture accrued. It would, in many cases, be attended with much delay and injury, without any one advantage, were it necessary to send property for trial to a distant district, merely because the forfeiture had been incurred there. The court feels no disposition to impose these inconveniences on either of the parties, unless where it be positively directed by an act of congress. There being no provision of that kind in the law under which this forfeiture accrued, the court cannot perceive any error in the proceedings below; and therefore orders that the <i>judgment of the circuit court be affirmed with costs</i>.</p>

<p><span class="star-pagination">*345</span> Harper, for the plaintiff in error.</p>
<p>Ridgely, contra.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*347</span> MARSHALL, Ch. J. There are only two points in this case.</p>
<p>1. Whether Scarth had such an interest as was protected by the treaty; and,</p>
<p>2. Whether the present case be a case arising under a treaty, within the meaning of the constitution.</p>
<p>This court has no doubt upon either point.</p>
<p>The interest by debt intended to be protected by the treaty, must be an interest holden as a security for money at the time of the treaty; and the debt must still remain due.</p>
<p>The 25th section of the judiciary act must be restrained by the constitution, the words of which are, "all cases arising under treaties." The plaintiff in error does not contend that his right grows out of <span class="star-pagination">*348</span> the treaty. Whether it is an obstacle to the plaintiff's recovery is a question exclusively for the decision of the courts of Maryland.</p>
<p>Harper, on the next day, having suggested to the court that he understood the opinion to be that this court had no jurisdiction to revise the decisions of the state courts, in cases where the construction of a treaty was drawn in question incidentally, and where the party himself did not claim title under a treaty, was about to make some further observations on those points, when</p>
<p>MARSHALL, Ch. J. observed, that Mr. Harper had misunderstood the opinion of the court, in that respect. It was not that this court had not jurisdiction if the treaty were drawn in question incidentally.</p>
<p>The reason for inserting that clause in the constitution was, that all persons who have real claims under a treaty should have their causes decided by the national tribunals. It was to avoid the apprehension as well as the danger of state prejudices. The words of the constitution are, "cases arising under treaties." Each treaty stipulates something respecting the citizens of the two nations, and gives them rights. Whenever a right grows out of, or is protected by, a treaty, it is sanctioned against all the laws and judicial decisions of the states; and whoever may have this right, it is to be protected. But if the person's title is not affected by the treaty, if he claims nothing under a treaty, his title cannot be protected by the treaty. If Scarth or his heirs had claimed, it would have been a case arising under a treaty. But neither the title of Scarth, nor of any person claiming under him, can be affected by the decision of this cause.</p>
<p>Harper. The opinion is more limited than I apprehended. But in this case the land is claimed as confiscated, and the question is, whether the plaintiff's <span class="star-pagination">*349</span> title, by confiscation, is good under the treaty. The defendant has a good title against every body who cannot show a better. He has a right to protect himself, by showing that the plaintiff has no title. In order to do this, he insists that the title of the plaintiff is inconsistent with the treaty. He has a right to set up the treaty in opposition to the confiscating act of Maryland.</p>
<p>Martin, on the same side.</p>
<p>The reason of the clause in the constitution was, that there might be uniformity of decision upon all questions arising upon the construction of the constitution, and laws and treaties of the United States. In every case, the question concerning a treaty must come on incidentally. The intention was, that wherever a state court should decide against a claim, set up under the construction of a treaty, such decision should be examinable in this court.</p>
<p>This was the cotemporaneous exposition given to the constitution by the first congress, convened under that constitution, and which was composed of a great number of the leading members of the convention by which the constitution was framed; and who must have well known what was the intention of that body in adopting that article.</p>
<p>The right of the plaintiff to recover in this suit, and the right of the defendant to retain the possession as against this plaintiff, depend upon the treaty.</p>
<p>The property having been once granted, the state could not again acquire the title but by escheat or confiscation. The court below decided, that it was not a case of escheat, because the heirs of Scarth were living. Whether the property was confiscated within the meaning of the treaty, is therefore the only remaining question upon the merits of the case. That question, however, is not before this court, until this court shall decide whether they are <span class="star-pagination">*350</span> competent to consider it in this case. We consider the judiciary act as a correct exposition of the constitution in this respect, and that this is clearly a case within the provisions of the 25th section of that act.</p>
<p>This argument produced no alteration in the opinion of the court; and the</p>
<p>Writ of error was dismissed.<sup>[*]</sup></p>
<h2>NOTES</h2>
<p>[*]  As this cause occupied a considerable portion of the time and talents of the courts and bar of Maryland, and as it decided several important points in that state, it indeemed not improper to give a short abstract of the case as it appears in the bills of exception.
</p>
<p>Upon the trial, the defendant Owings took 10 bills of exception.</p>
<p>The 1st bill of exceptions stated that the plaintiff offered in evidence a patent from the lord proprietor of Maryland to Thomas Brown, dated November 10, 1695, for a tract of land called Brown's Adventure, containing 1,000 acres. Also a patent from the state of Maryland to Edward Norwood, the original plaintiff in this action, dated 25th June, 1800, for a tract of land called "The Discovery," containing 520 1-2 acres, included within the lines of Brown's Adventure. The defendant offered evidence that the heirs of Brown, the original patentee, were still living in Maryland. The defendant offered in evidence a deed from Brown to Gadsby, dated May 2, 1700, on which was an endorsement dated May 4, 1699, purporting to be a receipt for the alienation fine due to the lord proprietor. And the following "Memorandum: That the date of this was originally according to the date of the above receipt, but aliened by consent of the provincial court and parties, to bring it within the act of assembly.</p>
                                    "W. TAYLARD."
<p>Whereupon the defendant prayed the court to instruct the jury that if they were of opinion that the endorsements were made at the request of Gadsby the grantee, and with his privity and consent, and that the deed with the endorsements was recorded for his benefit, and with his assent, then the endorsements are competent to be read in evidence to support the facts therein contained against the title of Gadsby to the lands in the deed mentioned. But the court was of opinion that the memorandum of Taylard "was not evidence, being an act done by the said W. Taylard without authority, and that the said deed was valid and operative in law to transfer the said land to the said Gadsby."</p>
<p>The 2d bill of exceptions states that, in addition to the above evidence, the plaintiff offered in evidence a deed from Gadsby to Barker, for 130 acres, part of Brown's Adventure, dated 10th of July, 1701. Also a deed from Gadsby to Aaron Rawlins of the residue of Brown's Adventure, dated 2d of October 1703. Also a deed of mortgage in fee from Rawlins to Jonathan Searth, dated the 13th of May, 1706. He also offered evidence that Barker and Scarth died before 1795, without heirs. Also an escheat warrant to the plaintiff, dated 28th of October, 1795, and a certificate of resurvey, and a patent thereupon to the plaintiff, dated 25th of June, 1800. The plaintiff also offered evidence, that the lands are truly located on the plats as directed by the plaintiff. The defendant offered evidence that the heirs of Brown were still living in Maryland; that Searth's heirs are still living in England, and that he and his heirs were always British subjects, and always resided in England.</p>
<p>The court had directed the jury that if the heirs of Searth were living in England at the passage of the acts of October session, 1780, c. 45 c. 49. and c. 51, the warrant of escheat which issued to the plaintiff, issued without authority of law, but that a patent which issued on such a warrant came within the provision of the act of November session, 1781, c. 20 s. 8 whereupon the defendant offered in evidence the valuation of the land so escheated by the plaintiff, and the sum by him paid into the treasury for the said lands on the 24th of December, 1799, and that the sum so paid, was only two thirds of the appraised value of the said lands so escheated, and prayed the direction of the court, that if the jury should be of opinion that the plaintiff had paid only two thirds of the appraised value, he could not entitle himself to the benefit of the warranty contained in the act of November, 1781, c. 20. s. 8 "But the court were of opinion, that if the jury should find the facts as stated, the said patent was good, valid and operative in law to pass the said land to the said Edward Norwood and his heirs, and so directed the jury notwithstanding the said Edward Norwood had not paid more than two thirds of the appraised value of the said land. The court considering the case of the said Edward Norwood as coming fully within the provision of the 8th sect of the act of November session, 1781, c. 20. and that the two thirds of the value of the said land was as much as the said Edward Norwood was liable to pay; to which last opinion, and to so much of the former opinion as declares the said patent to come within the provisions of the act of November, 1781, c. 20. Â§ 8 the defendant excepted."</p>
<p>The 3d bill of exceptions, in addition to the foregoing evidence, stated, that the defendant offered evidence of a judgment of condemnation of these lands upon an attachment from the provincial court in 1732, for a debt of 897l 9s. 6d. sterling, due from Scarth to one Littleton Waters. The plaintiff offered in evidence duplicate writs of attachment to other counties issued by Waters for the same debt, upon which sundry sums of money were attached and condemned in the hands of garnishees, amounting altogether to 226l. 8s. 4d. sterling. To show that the lands attached by Waters was the 386 acres located on the plats as being in the possession of the Baltimore company, the plaintiff read in evidence the lord proprietor's old rent-roll, stating 870 acres to be in possession of Rawlins, and 130 in the possession of John Barker. And the last rent-roll stating 419 acres to be in possession of Searth, and 385 in the possession of Charles Carroll &amp; Co.; and the lord proprietor's debt-book for the year 1754, (being the oldest book of that kind remaining,) which charges the Baltimore company with the quit-rents of 386 acres and no more, and Searth with 419; which charges were continued annually until the revolution. And the defendant thereupon prayed the opinion of the court, that by virtue of the said judgment and attachment and condemnation by him given in evidence, a legal estate was vested in the said Littleton Waters in the said tract of land called Brown's Adventure. But the court were of opinion, and so directed the jury, that the said Littleton Waters did not acquire a legal estate in the said land by virtue of the said judgment, attachment and condemnation.</p>
<p>The 4th bill of exceptions stated the same facts, and further that the defendant read the act of assembly passed at November session, 1797, c. 119. and prayed the opinion of the court, that by virtue of that act the right of the state was so far vested in the persons possessing the land called Brown's Adventure under the condemnation aforesaid, that the plaintiff could not in virtue of his said warrant, certificate and patent have any right or title to the said land; or, if any, then no more than the proportion or compensation to which a discoverer of confiscated property is entitled. But the court were of opinion that the right of the plaintiff to Brown's Adventure attached upon his obtaining the warrant of escheat, and that his right was saved and protected by the proviso in the 2d section of the said act of November, 1797, c. 119. And that the grant transferred to him the interest the state had in the land called "The Discovery" from the time of his obtention of his said warrant of escheat.</p>
<p>The 5th bill of exceptions states the same facts, whereupon the defendant prayed the opinion of the court, and their direction to the jury, that if the warrant of escheat which issued in this case, issued without authority of law, then the warranty contained in the act of November, 1781, c. 20. Â§ 8 did not operate to give title to the plaintiff, and that there can be no relation to a warrant which issues without authority of law, or to a certificate made in pursuance of such warrant.</p>
<p>But the court were of opinion, that the act of 1781, c. 20. Â§ 8. did secure to the plaintiff the said land so by him escheated on his paying two thirds of the value of the said land, being what the plaintiff was liable to pay for the same as confiscated British property; and that the grant obtained by the plaintiff did operate to pass the land to him by relation from the date of the said warrant.</p>
<p>The 6th bill of exceptions also stated the same facts, and that the defendant thereupon prayed the court to direct the jury that if the said tract of land called Brown's Adventure belonged to a British subject at the time of passing the act for confiscating British property in the state of Maryland, and if no actual possession had been taken thereof by the said state or its agents, and no sale or disposition made thereof by the state to any person at any time before the treaty between the United States and Great Britain dated the 19th of November, 1794, took effect, the plaintiff could make no title thereto by his said warrant, certificate and patent.</p>
<p>But the court refused to give that direction to the jury, being of opinion, that the state of Maryland, by their commissioners, was in possession of all British property within the limits of the said state, under and by virtue of the act of confiscation, October, 1780, c. 45. and the act of the same session, c. 49 to appoint commissioners, &amp;c. And that the possession of the said land was in the state of Maryland at the time the plaintiff obtained his escheat warrant; and that no British subject could hold land in the state of Maryland on the 19th of November, 1794, the time when the treaty was entered into between the United States and Great Britain.</p>
<p>The 7th bill of exceptions, in addition to the facts before mentioned, stated, that the defendant offered evidence that the heirs of Rawlins were still living in Maryland. That Rawlins, in the year 1741, made his will and devised Brown's Adventure by name to some of his children. That the heirs of Littleton Waters are still living in Maryland. That the Baltimore company, under whom the defendant claims, have been for fifty years past in the actual possession and user of the whole land called Brown's Adventure, by clearing and cutting the wood off the said land for their iron works, and claiming the said land; and that there has been no actual or mixed possession of any part of the said land by Scarth, or by any person claiming under him, or by any person claiming adversely to the Baltimore company. Whereupon the defendant prayed the court to direct the jury, that if they find the facts stated by the defendant to be true, and that no payment of principal or interest due on the said mortgage, or acknowledgement of the said mortgage, was at any time paid, made or done, on or after the 13th of May, 1709, the jury may and ought to presume the said mortgage satisfied before the year 1780, and that the plaintiff is not entitled to recover. But the court were of opinion that the facts stated in the above case will not warrant the jury in presuming the said mortgage was satisfied before the year 1780, and refused to give the direction prayed.</p>
<p>The 8th bill of exceptions states the same facts, and that the defendant further prayed the court to direct the jury, that if the facts are found true as stated by the defendant, the act of confiscation of October session, 1780, c. 45 and c. 49. vested no beneficial interest in the state of Maryland in the lands in the mortgage from Rawlins to Scarth, but that the same, if it vested in the state under the act of confiscation, was liable to the equity of redemption in the heirs of Rawlins the mortgagor, and that by operation of the British treaty, so far as the mortgagee could claim an interest in the said mortgaged lands, the same was saved from confiscation by the said treaty, and, consequently, the lessor of the plaintiff is not entitled to recover.</p>
<p>But the court were of opinion, that on the expiration of the time limited in the mortgage for the payment of the money, a complete legal estate of inheritance vested in the mortgagee liable to confiscation, and was vested in the state in virtue of the act of confiscation of October session, 1780, c. 45. and the act of the same session, c. 49. to appoint commissioners, subject to the right of redemption in the mortgagor and his heirs, and that the British treaty cannot operate to affect the plaintiff's right to recover in this ejectment, and refused to give the direction prayed.</p>
<p>The 9th bill of exceptions, in addition to the same facts, states, that the defendant offered in evidence a lease and release from Littleton Waters to Benjamin Tasker and others, dated June 20, and 21, 1738, of so much of Brown's Adventure as, according to a valuation upon oath returned to the provincial court, would amount to 145l. 1s. 5d. sterling, and thereupon prayed the court to instruct the jury, that if they find the facts as stated by the defendant, the deeds of lease and release from Waters to Tasker and others conveyed a legal title in the lands therein mentioned; and that if a legal title did not pass, then the jury may and ought to presume a title in the said Tasker and others to the whole of an undivided 386 acres of land, being an undivided part of the 870 acres of land mortgaged to Jonathan Scarth, called Brown's Adventure. But the court refused to give the direction prayed.</p>
<p>The 10th bill of exceptions states, that upon the same facts the defendant prayed the court to direct the jury that as to all that part of Brown's Adventure contained in the deed from Waters to Tasker and others, under whom the defendant claims, the patent granted to the plaintiff does not give him a title thereto, or enable him to recover the same, which direction the court refused to give.</p>

<p class="indent">ERROR to the circuit court for the district of Columbia, sitting at Alexandria, in an action of detinue for a female slave named Eliza. Upon the trial of the general issue in the court below, the plaintiff in error, who was defendant in that court, took a bill of exceptions, which stated that evidence was offered of the following facts: The slave, in November, 1798, was the property of <i>John Dabny</i>, against whom a <i>fieri facias</i> was issued at the suit of Norwood, the present defendant in error upon which the slave was seized and sold by the proper officer; that one Charles Turner bought her for the said Norwood, and held her, as Norwood's property, until November, 1802, when he delivered her, without authority from Norwood, to one R. B. Jamesson, who held her until September, 1806, when he became insolvent under the insolvent act of the district of Columbia, and delivered her, as part of his property, to Auld, the plaintiff in error, who was appointed trustee under that act. This suit was commenced on the 19th of September, 1806.</p>

<p class="indent">The whole argument against us depends upon the single case of <i>Bingham</i> v. <i>Cobot;</i> for although in other cases the same point has been decided, yet the subsequent decisions are all founded upon that case. The effect of that decision has been to exclude many cases upon nice questions of pleading, which would otherwise have been clearly within the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States. No exception was taken to the jurisdiction in the court below; and this court would not willingly turn us out of court, after encountering all the risk, expense, delay and labour of a jury trial, upon an exception, which, if taken in the first instance, might have prevented all that risk, expense, and delay. In the case of <i>Abercombie</i> v. <i>Dupuis, (ante, vol.</i> 1. <i>p.</i> 343.) the present Chief Justice (<i>Marshall</i>) intimated a doubt how the question would then have been decided if is were at new case, and if the court was not bound by the case of <i>Bingham</i> v. <i>Cabot</i>. This doubt shows that the court was not then inclined to extend the principle farther than that case warrants. At the time the court decided the case of <i>Bingham</i> v. <i>Cabot</i>, the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States was an object of jealousy, and there was probably a desire on the part of the court to remove all ground of suspicion, by deciding doubtful cases against the jurisdiction. This circumstance probably induced them to be over scrupulous upon that subject. But it is as much the duty of this court to exercise jurisdiction in cases where it is given by the constitution and laws of the United States, as to refuse to assume it where it is not given.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p7">

<p class="indent">The person who drew the declaration in the present case seems to have been aware of the decision in the case of Bingham v. Cabot, and to have intended to describe the parties in such a manner as to give the court jurisdiction. The defendant is described as '<i>a company legally incorporated by the legislature of the State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, and established at Providence in the said district</i>.'</p>

<p class="indent">The term <i>citizen</i> could not with propriety be applied to a corporation aggregate. It could only be a citizen by <i>intendment of law</i>. It is only a moral person; but it may be a citizen <i>quoad hoc, i. e.</i> in the sense in which the term <i>citizen</i> is used in that part of the constitution which speaks of the jurisdiction of the judicial power of the United States. The term is indeterminate in its signification. It has different meanings in different parts of the constitution. When it says 'the citizens of each state shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in the several states,' the term <i>citizens</i> has a meaning different from that in which it is used in describing the jurisdiction of the courts.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p9">
<span class="num">9</span>
<p class="indent">To say that all the individual members of a body corporate must be citizens of a certain description, destroys the idea of a body politic. It is the body politic, the moral person, that sues; and not the individuals who compose the corporation. Its powers, its duties and capacities are different from those of the individuals of whom it is composed. It can neither derive benefit from the privileges, nor suffer injury by the incapacities, of any of those individuals.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p10">
<span class="num">10</span>
<p class="indent">Thus the infancy of any or even of all the members of a body corporate does not affect the validity of its acts. Nor does the alienage of the members prevent the body politic from holding lands. A majority of the members of the bank of the United States are aliens.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p11">
<span class="num">11</span>
<p class="indent">The objection goes to exclude all corporations aggregate from the federal courts. For if a corporation cannot be a citizen it cannot be an alien. And as the individual members are constantly changing by the transfer of stock, it is impossible to ascertain at any precise moment who are the individuals who constitute the corporate body; and it would at any time be in the power of a corporation defendant to evade the jurisdiction of the court, by taking in a new member who should be of the same state with the plaintiff.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p12">
<span class="num">12</span>
<p class="indent">At all events it is an objection which ought to be pleaded in abatement according to the course of the common law, so that the plaintiff may have a better declaration; and by that means much expense, time and labour would be saved.</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p13">

<p class="indent">The reason of giving jurisdiction to the courts of the United States in cases between citizens of different states, applies with the greatest force to the case of a powerful moneyed corporation erected within, and under the laws of a particular state. If there was a probability that an individual citizen of a state could influence the state courts in his favour, how much stronger is the probability that they could be influenced in favour of a powerful moneyed institution which might be composed of the most influential characters in the state. What chance for justice could a plaintiff have against such a powerful association in the courts of a small state whose judges perhaps were annually elected, or held their offices at the will of the legislature?</p>
</div>
<div class="num" id="p14">
<span class="num">14</span>
<p class="indent">If the jurisdiction of the federal courts is limited by the letter of the constitution, they have no jurisdiction in a case between a citizen of one state and a citizen of another state; because the constitution speaks of <i>citizens</i>, in the plural, so that there must be more than one plaintiff, and more than one defendant. So also there could be no jurisdiction if one of the parties was a woman, because a woman cannot be a <i>citizen;</i> which is a term applicable only to a <i>male</i>.</p>

<center><h1>THE BANK OF THE UNITED STATES<br/>
v.<br/>
DEVEAUX ET AL.</h1></center>
<center><p><b>Supreme Court of United States.</b></p></center>
<center>March 15, 1809.</center>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*63</span> <i>Binney,</i> for the plaintiffs in error.</p>
<p><i>P.B. Key,</i> contra.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*84</span> MARSHALL, Ch. J. delivered the opinion of the court as follows:</p>
<p>Two points have been made in this cause.</p>
<p>1. That a corporation, composed of citizens of <span class="star-pagination">*85</span> one state, may sue a citizen of another state, in the federal courts.</p>
<p>2. That a right to sue in those courts is conferred on this bank by the law which incorporates it.</p>
<p>The last point will be first considered.</p>
<p>The judicial power of the United States, as defined in the constitution, is dependent, 1st. On the nature of the case; and, 2d. On the character of the parties.</p>
<p>By the judicial act, the jurisdiction of the circuit courts is extended to cases where the constitutional right to plead and be impleaded, in the courts of the union, depends on the character of the parties; but where that right depends on the nature of the case, the circuit courts derive no jurisdiction from that act, except in the single case of a controversy between citizens of the same state, claiming lands under grants from different states.</p>
<p>Unless, then, jurisdiction over this cause has been given to the circuit court by some other than the judicial act, the bank of the United States had not a right to sue in that court, upon the principle that the case arises under a law of the United States.</p>
<p>The plaintiffs contend that the incorporating act confers this jurisdiction.</p>
<p>That act creates the corporation, gives it a capacity to make contracts and to acquire property, and enables it "to sue and be sued, plead and be impleaded, answer and be answered, defend and be defended, in courts of record, or any other place whatsoever."</p>
<p>This power, if not incident to a corporation, is conferred by every incorporating act, and is not understood to enlarge the jurisdiction of any particular court, but to give a capacity to the corporation to <span class="star-pagination">*86</span> appear, as a corporation, in any court which would, by law, have cognisance of the cause, if brought by individuals. If jurisdiction is given by this clause to the federal courts, it is equally given to all courts having original jurisdiction, and for all sums however small they may be.</p>
<p>But the 9th article of the 7th section of the act furnishes a conclusive argument against the construction for which the plaintiffs contend. That section subjects the president and directors, in their individual capacity, to the suit of any person aggrieved by their putting into circulation more notes than is permitted by law, and expressly authorizes the bringing of that action in the federal or state courts.</p>
<p>This evinces the opinion of congress, that the right to sue does not imply a right to sue in the courts of the union, unless it be expressed. This idea is strengthened also by the law respecting patent rights. That law expressly recognizes the right of the patentee to sue in the circuit courts of the United States.</p>
<p>The court, then, is of opinion, that no right is conferred on the bank, by the act of incorporation, to sue in the federal courts.</p>
<p>2. The other point is one of much more difficulty.</p>
<p>The jurisdiction of this court being limited, so far as respects the character of the parties in this particular case, "to controversies between citizens of different states," both parties must be citizens, to come within the description.</p>
<p>That invisible, intangible, and artificial being, that mere legal entity, a corporation aggregate, is certainly not a citizen; and, consequently, cannot sue or be sued in the courts of the United States, unless the rights of the members, in this respect, can be exercised in their corporate name. If the corporation <span class="star-pagination">*87</span> be considered as a mere faculty, and not as a company of individuals, who, in transacting their joint concerns, may use a legal name, they must be excluded from the courts of the union.</p>
<p>The duties of this court, to exercise jurisdiction where it is conferred, and not to usurp it where it is not conferred, are of equal obligation. The constitution, therefore, and the law, are to be expounded, without a leaning the one way or the other, according to those general principles which usually govern in the construction of fundamental or other laws.</p>
<p>A constitution, from its nature, deals in generals, not in detail. Its framers cannot perceive minute distinctions which arise in the progress of the nation, and therefore confine it to the establishment of broad and general principles.</p>
<p>The judicial department was introduced into the American constitution under impressions, and with views, which are too apparent not to be perceived by all. However true the fact may be, that the tribunals of the states will administer justice as impartially as those of the nation, to parties of every description, it is not less true that the constitution itself either entertains apprehensions on this subject, or views with such indulgence the possible fears and apprehensions of suitors, that it has established national tribunals for the decision of controversies between aliens and a citizen, or between citizens of different states. Aliens, or citizens of different states, are not less susceptible of these apprehensions, nor can they be supposed to be less the objects of constitutional provision, because they are allowed to sue by a corporate name. That name, indeed, cannot be an alien or a citizen; but the persons whom it represents may be the one or the other; and the controversy is, in fact and in law, between those persons suing in their corporate character, by their corporate name, for a corporate right, and the individual against whom the suit may be instituted. Substantially <span class="star-pagination">*88</span> and essentially, the parties in such a case, where the members of the corporation are aliens, or citizens of a different state from the opposite party, come within the spirit and terms of the jurisdiction conferred by the constitution on the national tribunals.</p>
<p>Such has been the universal understanding on the subject. Repeatedly has this court decided causes between a corporation and an individual without feeling a doubt respecting its jurisdiction. Those decisions are not cited as authority; for they were made without considering this particular point; but they have much weight, as they show that this point neither occurred to the bar or the bench; and that the common understanding of intelligent men is in favor of the right of incorporated aliens, or citizens of a different state from the defendant, to sue in the national courts. It is by a course of acute, metaphysical and abstruse reasoning, which has been most ably employed on this occasion, that this opinion is shaken.</p>
<p>As our ideas of a corporation, its privileges and its disabilities, are derived entirely from the English books, we resort to them for aid, in ascertaining its character. It is defined as a mere creature of the law, invisible, intangible, and incorporeal. Yet, when we examine the subject further, we find that corporations have been included within terms of description appropriated to real persons.</p>
<p>The statute of Henry VIII. concerning bridges and highways, enacts, that bridges and highways shall be made and repaired by the "<i>inhabitants</i> of the city, shire, or riding," and that the justices shall have power to tax every "<i>inhabitant</i> of such city," &amp;c. and that the collectors may "distrain every such <i>inhabitant</i> as shall be taxed and refuse payment thereof, in his lands, goods and chattels."</p>
<p>Under this statute those have been construed inhabitants who hold lands within the city where the <span class="star-pagination">*89</span> bridge to be repaired lies, although they reside elsewhere.</p>
<p>Lord Coke says, "every corporation and body politic residing in any county, riding, city, or town corporate, or having lands or tenements in any shire, <i>quÃ¦ propriis manibus et sumptibus possident et habent,</i> are said to be inhabitants there, within the purview of this statute."</p>
<p>The tax is not imposed on the person, whether he be a member of the corporation or not, who may happen to reside on the lands; but is imposed on the corporation itself, and, consequently, this ideal existence is considered as an inhabitant, when the general spirit and purpose of the law requires it.</p>
<p>In the case of <i>The King</i> v. <i>Gardner,</i> reported by <i>Cowper,</i> a corporation was decided, by the court of king's bench, to come within the description of "occupiers or inhabitants." In that case the poor rates, to which the lands of the corporation were declared to be liable, were not assessed to the actual occupant, for there was none, but to the corporation. And the principle established by the case appears to be, that the poor rates, on vacant ground belonging to a corporation, may be assessed to the corporation, as being inhabitants or occupiers of that ground. In this case Lord Mansfield notices and overrules an inconsiderate <i>dictum</i> of Justice Yates, that a corporation could not be an inhabitant or occupier.</p>
<p>These opinions are not precisely in point; but they serve to show that, for the general purposes and objects of a law, this invisible, incorporeal creature of the law may be considered as having corporeal qualities.</p>
<p>It is true that as far as these cases go they serve to show that the corporation itself, in its incorporeal character, may be considered as an inhabitant or an occupier; and the argument from them would be more strong in favour of considering the corporation <span class="star-pagination">*90</span> itself as endowed for this special purpose with the character of a citizen, than to consider the character of the individuals who compose it as a subject which the court can inspect, when they use the name of the corporation, for the purpose of asserting their corporate rights. Still the cases show that this technical definition of a corporation does not uniformly circumscribe its capacities, but that courts for legitimate purposes will contemplate it more substantially.</p>
<p>There is a case, however, reported in 12 Mod. which is thought precisely in point. The corporation of London brought a suit against Wood, by their corporate name, in the mayor's court. The suit was brought by the mayor and commonalty, and was tried before the mayor and aldermen. The judgment rendered in this cause was brought before the court of king's bench and reversed, because the court was deprived of its jurisdiction by the character of the individuals who were members of the corporation.</p>
<p>In that case the objection, that a corporation was an invisible, intangible thing, a mere incorporeal legal entity, in which the characters of the individuals who composed it were completely merged, was urged and was considered. The judges unanimously declared that they could look beyond the corporate name, and notice the character of the individual. In the opinions, which were delivered <i>seriatim,</i> several cases are put which serve to illustrate the principle, and fortify the decision.</p>
<p>The case of <i>The Mayor and Commonalty</i> v. <i>Wood,</i> is the stronger, because it is on the point of jurisdiction. It appears to the court to be a full authority for the case now under consideration. It seems not possible to distinguish them from each other.</p>
<p>If, then, the congress of the United States had, in terms, enacted that incorporated aliens might suc <span class="star-pagination">*91</span> a citizen, or that the incorporated citizens of one state might sue a citizen of another state, in the federal courts, by its corporate name, this court would not have felt itself justified in declaring that such a law transcended the constitution.</p>
<p>The controversy is substantially between aliens, suing by a corporate name, and a citizen, or between citizens of one state, suing by a corporate name, and those of another state. When these are said to be substantially the parties to the controversy, the court does not mean to liken it to the case of a trustee. A trustee is a real person capable of being a citizen or an alien, who has the whole legal estate in himself. At law, he is the real proprietor, and he represents himself, and sues in his own right. But in this case the corporate name represents persons who are members of the corporation.</p>
<p>If the constitution would authorize congress to give the courts of the union jurisdiction in this case, in consequence of the character of the members of the corporation, then the judicial act ought to be construed to give it. For the term citizen ought to be understood as it is used in the constitution, and as it is used in other laws. That is, to describe the real persons who come into court, in this case, under their corporate name.</p>
<p>That corporations composed of citizens are considered by the legislature as citizens, under certain circumstances, is to be strongly inferred from the registering act. It never could be intended that an American registered vessel, abandoned to an insurance company composed of citizens, should lose her character as an American vessel; and yet this would be the consequence of declaring that the members of the corporation were, to every intent and purpose, out of view, and merged in the corporation.</p>
<p>The court feels itself authorized by the case in 12 <i>Mod.</i> on a question of jurisdiction, to look to <span class="star-pagination">*92</span> the character of the individuals who compose the corporation, and they think that the precedents of this court, though they were not decisions on argument, ought not to be absolutely disregarded.</p>
<p>If a corporation may sue in the courts of the union, the court is of opinion that the averment in this case is sufficient.</p>
<p>Being authorized to sue in their corporate name, they could make the averment, and it must apply to the plaintiffs as individuals, because it could not be true as applied to the corporation.</p>
<p><i>Judgment reversed; plea in abatement overruled, and cause remanded.</i></p>

The case was <span class="star-pagination">*288</span> brought up to last term. The party ought to have come prepared to support the jurisdiction.</p>
<p>This being the last day of the term, and no affidavits having been produced,</p>
<p>The writ of error was dismissed, this court having no jurisdiction in the case.</p>

<center><p><b>Supreme Court of United States.</b></p></center>
<center>March 13, 1809.</center>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*359</span> <i>C. Lee,</i> for the plaintiff in error.</p>
<p><i>Swann,</i> contra.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*361</span> MARSHALL, Ch. J. delivered the opinion of the court to the following effect:</p>
<p>This court is of opinion that the possession of Chapman was a bar to the seizure of the slave by the marshal, under the execution stated in this case. The only objection of any weight was, that there was no administration upon the estate of Robert Alexander, sen. and, consequently, that the possession of Chapman was not an <i>adverse</i> possession.</p>
<p>But there was an executor competent to assent, and who did assent, to the legacy, and to the partition between the legatees, and who could not afterwards refuse to execute the will.</p>
<p>Judgment affirmed.</p>
