The past decade has been witness to historic supreme court decisions. Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission (2010) unleashed corporate election spending and Obergefell v. Hodges (2015) has had a profound impact on the lives of millions of Americans by establishing marriage equality in the United States. 

These and other landmark decisions are of great interest to the public, and may generate significant media coverage and even evoke public demonstrations.

In August 2017 Washington University Law began hosting modern and publicly available case and justice centered data from 1946-2016. This presents a new opportunity to answer interesting questions with a potentially under-tapped data source.

Harvard provides a list of public and private sources of public opinion data (https://guides.library.harvard.edu/public_opinion). 

Recently, I have become personally fascinated by the supreme court and its impact on life in the United States. Specifically, I wonder to what extent it is a reflection of the moods, morals, and opinions of the public.

I propose to explore the following question: Is there a tipping point at which overwhelming public support for an issue is followed by a supreme court decision?

For example, as US public opinion on homosexuality evolved over time, was there a clear point in time at which a majority of the US answered 'Yes' to the question 'Do you support gay marriage'? What was this proportion when Obergefell v. Hodges was decided? If so, how long did it take to go from a bare majority to this tipping point?

By examining many cases (most easily those with yes/no support possibilities such as abortion) we can get a sense of this relationship.
