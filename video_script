Capstone Project for TDI

Name: Jackson Walters
Project Title: US Supreme Court v. Court of Public Opinion

Concept: Relates opinions and decisions of SC to opinion of US public at large.

Implementation:

- Uses publicly available data from SCDB and ANES.
- Input: Set of keywords to specify issue, e.g. LGBTQ rights.
- App uses NLP tools to identify relevants cases and PO questions.
- Sentiment analysis to decide polarity of judicial vote and public
responses (pro or anti), e.g. a vote in favor of the plantiff Obgefell
would be considered pro LGBTQ rights as would a response of 'Yes' to the
question "Do you support gays in the military?".
- After normalizing to a scale of [-1,1] and averaging, we obtain a metric
for measuring SC support and public support on an issue.
