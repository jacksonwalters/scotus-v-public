ANES Time Series Cumulative Data File - Appendices

>> WEIGHTS 

To accommodate the addition of ANES 2012 and later Time Series Study, weights 
in the file 
have been replaced.

Selection among the new CDF weights depends upon how CDF data from 2012 and 
later years are  used. The ANES 2012 and 2016 Time Series Study included both 
face-to-face (in-person) interviews and Web interviews. Data from both of the
modes are present in the CDF. 

It must first be decided whether CDF data should be used from the full 
(combined) sample, from the FTF-only sample, or from the internet-only sample.

When using the combined sample, one of the following three CDF weight 
variables can apply: 
  VCF0009z, VCF0010z, VCF0011z
When using the FTF-only sample, one of the following three CDF weight 
variables can apply: 
  VCF0009x, VCF0010x, VCF0011x
When using the Web-only sample,  one of the following three CDF weight 
variables can apply: 
  VCF0009y, VCF0010y, VCF0011y

Once the desired sample from has been identifed, and the choice of weight has been 
narrowed down to one of the three "z" variables, or one of the three "x" variables, 
or one of the three "y" variables), selection of a specific weight variable numbered 
0009, 0010, or 0011 (from among the set of three weights with the same letter suffix, 
"x" or "y" or "z") now depends upon the type of 1970 data being used. 

 In the 1970 Time Series study, weights were applicable at variable level for  3 
types of 1970 variables, Type "0", Type "1" and Type "2".  
In CDF codebook documentation, indication is provided for every CDF variable 
whether 1970 data are from Type 0, Type 1, or Type 2 variables.  For 1970,  
the three "0009" weight variables (VCF0009x,VCF0009y,VCF0009z) are for 1970 
type 0; the three "0010" weight variables (VCF0010x,VCF0010y,VCF0010z) are for 
1970 type 1, and the three "0011" weight variables (VCF0011x,VCF0011y,VCF0011z) 
are for 1970 Type 2.  

If, for example, you have chosen to work with the FTF-only sample from 2012, 
an "x" variable should be chosen; VCF0009x should be selected if the CDF
variable being used has documentation in the codebook indicating 1970 data 
were Type 0, VCF0010x should be selected if the CDF variable being used has 
documentation in the codebook indicating 1970 data were Type 1, and VCF0011x 
should be selected if the CDF variable being used has documentation in the 
codebook indicating 1970 data were Type 2

If use of the CDF includes 2012 data but excludes 1970 data, it does not matter 
whether the 0009, 0010, or 0011 variable is used as long as the "x" or "y" or "z" 
suffix is appropriate.  Values are identical across variables having the same 
suffix (x or y or z) for all years except 1970.

If use of the CDF includes 1970 data but excludes 2012 data, the "x" or "y" or 
"z" suffix does not matter as long as the number (0009 or 0010 or 0011) is 
appropriate to the type of 1970 data.

If neither 1970 nor 2012 data from the CDF are being used, than any of the 9
variables can be used: all 9 weights are identical for years other than 1970
and 2012.

NOTE: most variables in the ANES Timeseries Cumulative Data File that
include 1970 data use "Type 0" data from 1970.  
CDF variables including 1970 Type 1 and 1970 Type 2 are the following:

     VCF0522	Type 1
     VCF0601	Type 1
     VCF0602	Type 1

>> 1992 ERRORS IN CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT ASSIGNMENTS

     Late in 1994, in conjunction with field work for the 1994
     NES, it became apparent that in 50 cases of the 1992 NES
     Study an incorrect congressional district number had been
     assigned.  These errors affect all questions related to House
     race which are administered according to assigned-CD
     candidates.  Below is a listing of 1992 (pre) case IDs with
     correct congressional districts, however no data have been
     changed in this file as a result.  Users of CF data can
     delete these cases from affected vars if desired.  NES plans
     to produce in 1995 a technical report examining the 1992
     incidence of CD misassignment and its possible effects on
     1992 NES data.

>> URBANISM NOTE



     Definitions describing urbanism categories have continued to change over
     time.  The following summarizes by year the recoding of original NES
     variable categories into the categories contained in Cumulative File
     variable 111.  The code categories of CF var 111 are:

               Code 1:   Central Cities
               Code 2:   Suburban areas
               Code 3:   Rural, small towns, outlying and adjacent areas

** NOTE:

     In 1962, no variable was created in the original dataset which described
     the urbanism of R's place of interview.  Thus, for 1962 CF V111 was
     created directly from an original var which listed PSU codes.

     PSU codes in 1962 were 4-digit numbers in which the third digit indicated
     "type."  Types were described as follow:

          type 1,2  "Self-Representing PSUs--12 largest metropolitan areas
                    defined by the 1950 Census."
          type 3,4  "Suburbs of the 12 self-representing PSUs."
          type 5,6  "Non-Self-Representing PSUs which include a city of over
                    50,000."
          type 7,8  "Non-Self-Representing PSUs which do not include a city of
                    over 50,000."

     PSU codes type 1 and 2 were recoded to CF V111 code 1.
     PSU codes type 3 and 4 were recoded to CF V111 code 2.
     PSU codes type 7 and 8 were recoded to CF V111 code 3.
     PSU codes type 5 and 6 were recoded to either CF V111 code 1 or code 2.

     To identify the specific type 5 and type 6 locations (PSU codes) recoded
     to CF V111 code 1 or code 2, the NES study staff can provide a listing
     upon request.

>> CENSUS OCCUPATION CODES

For all years, 'occupation' in the original studies may represent
present OR past employment.  Exact employment information taken from
the original data are described below, by year.  Note that, in 1980
and thereafter, for Rs working after retirement, both past and current
occupations were determined in the original studies, but past employ-
ment is incorporated here.

Since 1984 (exc. 2002):
CURRENT EMPLOYMENT used in this variable applies to Rs who are also
homemakers and students only if R works more than 20 hours per week
NOT CODED 7,8 in VCF0116].  Rs who are working after retirement are
categorized by their past employment, regardless of current number of
working hours (and regardless whether included in "working now" in
VCF0116/VCF0118).  The working "disabled" are coded for current
employment. PAST EMPLOYMENT used in this var applies to retirees, the
unemployed (if they have ever worked), and the nonworking disabled (if
they have ever worked), but does not cover non-working students and
homemakers who have worked in the past 6 months, even though
occupational data for their most recent job is available in the
original study data [but see VCF0151].  NONEMPLOYMENT:  If the
unemployed and disabled have never worked, they are not included in
valid data; students working less than 20 hours per week as well as
nonworking students are not in valid data. Homemakers not working
or working less than 20 hours per week appear in code 6.

1980-1982:
CURRENT EMPLOYMENT used in this variable applies to Rs who are also
homemakers and students only if R works more than 20 hours per week
[NOT CODED 7,8 in VCF0116].  Rs who are working after retirement are
categorized by their past employment, regardless of current number of
working hours (and regardless whether included in "working now" in
VCF0116/VCF0118).  Anyone identified as "disabled" is presumed not
currently working and is therefore not classified for current
occupation; if R is disabled and works, R's work status is "working
now" rather than "permanently disabled" and R is coded for current
employment (not past employment).   PAST EMPLOYMENT used in this var
applies to retirees, the unemployed (if they have ever worked), and
the disabled (if they have worked in the past), but does not include
those nonworking students and homemakers who have worked in the past
12 months, even though occupational data for their most recent job
is available in the original study data [but see VCF0151].
NONEMPLOYMENT:  If the unemployed and disabled have never worked, they
are not included in valid data; nonworking students and students
working less than 20 hours per week are not in valid data (are 0),
while nonworking homemakers and homemakers working less than 20 hours
per week appear in code 6.

1972-1978:
CURRENT EMPLOYMENT used in this variable applies to Rs who are also
homemakers or students only if R works 20 or more hours per week [NOT
coded 7,8 in VCF0116]; no information at all was present these years
about occupations (past or current) of housewives/students working
less than 20 hours per week.  Rs who are working after being retired
or disabled may be coded here according to present OR past (pre-
retirement/disablement) employment, depending upon the following
condition:  if R's current job is related to his/her past employment,
then current job is coded (and R is identified as "working now" rather
than "retired" or "disabled" in VCF0116/VCF0118); if R's current job
is not related to his/her past employment, then past job is
represented (R is identified as "retired" or "disabled" in
VCF0116/VCF0118).  PAST EMPLOYMENT used in this var applies to the
"retired" (according to the condition above), to the unemployed (if
they have ever worked), and to the "disabled" (if they have worked
in the past and according to the condition above), but does not
include those nonworking students and homemakers who have worked
in the past 12 months, even though occupational data for their most
recent job is available in the original study data [but see VCF0151].
NONEMPLOYMENT:  If the unemployed and disabled have never worked,
they are not included in valid data; nonworking students and
students working less than 20 hours per week are not in valid data
(are 0), while nonworking homemakers and homemakers working less
than 20 hours per week appear in code 6.

1970:
CURRENT EMPLOYMENT used in this variable is not defined in terms of
number of hours.  Only those Rs who identify themselves as "employed"
or who volunteer "on strike" in response to the direct work status
question (choices given to R:  employed/unemployed/ retired/
housewife/student/'or what') are coded for current employment.
However, even though Rs who identify themselves as "housewives" or
"students" (and all Rs coded into 'other' in the work status variable)
are subsequently asked if they also do any work for pay [and, if so,
what], occupational data for current jobs of working "student"-
identifiers and working "homemaker"-identifiers are not incorporated
here [but see VCF0151].  Because the disabled are not identified in
1970, it is indeterminable whether they were coded for employment
(current or past).  The "retired" are not asked about any
post-retirement employment.  PAST EMPLOYMENT used in this var applies
to those who identify themselves as "retired" or "unemployed."
Nonworking homemakers and students are not asked about past
employment (if any).  NONEMPLOYMENT:  If the unemployed have never
worked, they are not included in valid data.  Those who identify
themselves as "students" are included in missing data (0), even if
they are also currently working.  Those who identify themselves as
"housewives" appear in code 6, even if they are also currently
working .

1968:
CURRENT EMPLOYMENT used in this variable is not defined in terms of
number of hours. Note that the original study's occupation data
appeared in 2 vars, for 'occupation' and 'second job,' and only the
first var is represented here.   Those who identify themselves as
"employed now" in response to the direct work status question (choices
given to R:  employed now/ unemployed, laid off or sick/ retired/
permanently disabled/ housewife/ student/ 'or what') are coded for
current employment given.  Rs who identify themselves as "housewives"
or "students" are subsequently asked if they also do any work for pay
and, if so, what:  the occupational data for current jobs of working
"student"-identifiers and working "homemaker"-identifiers are not
incorporated here [but see VCF0151] --unless R is working full time
and is a student "only in the evening."  Of 10 cases identified as
"physically disabled" in the original data, 6 are coded for some
current occupation and the remaining 4 are in NA missing data for
occupation.  The "retired" are not asked about any post-retirement
employment.  PAST EMPLOYMENT used in this var applies to those who
identify themselves as "retired" or "unemployed, laid off, or sick."
Nonworking homemakers and students are not asked about past employment
(if any).  NONEMPLOYMENT:  If the unemployed have never worked, they
are not included in valid data.  Those who identify themselves as
"students" (daytime) are included in missing data (0), even if they
are also currently working.  Rs who identify themselves as
"housewives" are in code 6, even if they are also currently working.

1952-1964:
During these years, two separate occupation questions were used in the
original data:  the first codes ALL Rs' employment, including
"student," "homemaker," "retired" and "unemployed" as categories.  Rs
falling into the latter two categories were then asked the second
occupation question which determines past employment and is also
represented here.  No information is available from any of these years
about disabled Rs, or about post-retirement occupations of retired Rs
(if any).  Nonworking "housewives" and "students" are not asked about
past employment (if any) during any years 1952-1964.  For 1956-1964,
homemakers who are also working part time are coded by current
occupation, not as housewives, and working students attending day
classes-- even part time-- are coded as students, while Rs attending
classes part time in the evening are coded by occupation.  For 1952,
only full-time employment is coded in the original data and here:
students and homemakers working part time are not coded by occupation;
they appear in 0 missing data (students) and code 6 (homemakers).

The 1954,1962,1966 occupation vars have not been included here since
they only described respondents who were also heads of households.

Since 1984, this variable has been a recode taken from a collapsed
version of the 1980 U.S. Census Occupation codes [full U.S. Census
occupation codes were also available in the original datasets].

Prior to 1984, the original variables used to create this var were
recodes from the following:

1976-1982:  1970 U.S. Census Occupation codes
1968-1974:  CPS Political Behavior Occupation codes
1964:  1960 U.S. Census Occupation codes
1956-1960:  1950 U.S. Dept. of Commerce Census of occupations

The original 1952 occupational data appeared in categories created by
by NES.  This coding scheme had fewer and broader occupational cate-
gories than subsequent years and could only approximately be recoded
into the categories appearing here.  [The original codes were:
19.Professional and semi-professional;  20.Self-employed businessmen
and artisans, managers; 30.Clerical and sales, buyers, agents,
brokers; 40.Skilled and semi-skilled; 60.Unskilled, service workers,
farm laborers; 61.Protective service;  80.Farm operators;
90.Unemployed; 92.Student; 95.Retired; 6. Housewife.]
The 1954 recode used for VCF0115 is:
19=1, 20=1, 30=2, 40=3, 61=3, 60=4, 80=5, 96=6, else=0.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
I. 1980 Census 0ccupation codes            
-----------------------------------------------------------------

The full 3-digit 1980 Census Occupation Code was used to
code the occupation of respondents.  In order to minimize
the amount of highly specific information released about
respondents, the full occupation code has been recoded to a
71 category code, which is based on the occupation code
sub-headings in the Census Code.

In the code description that follows, the full 1980 Census
Code is presented.  At the beginning of each recoded
section, the statement "(XXX) THROUGH (YYY) ARE RECODED TO
(ZZ)" indicates the code values to which the specific
occupations have been recoded.  Numbers in parentheses
following the occupation categories are the U.S. Department
of Commerce's 1980 Standard Occupational Classification code
equivalents.  The abbreviation "pt" means "part" and
"N.E.C." means "not elsewhere classified".

II. 1990 Census 0ccupation codes            
-----------------------------------------------------------------

The full 3-digit 1990 Census Occupation Code was used to
code the occupation of respondents.  In order to minimize
the amount of highly specific information released about
respondents, the full occupation code has been recoded to a
71 category code, which is based on the occupation code
sub-headings in the Census Code.

In the code description that follows, the full 1990 Census
Code is presented.  At the beginning of each recoded
section, the statement "(XXX) THROUGH (YYY) ARE RECODED TO
(ZZ)" indicates the code values to which the specific
occupations have been recoded.  Numbers in parentheses
following the occupation categories are the U.S. Department
of Commerce's 1980 Standard Occupational Classification code
equivalents.  The abbreviation "pt" means "part" and
"N.E.C." means "not elsewhere classified".

>> WORK STATUS 

WORK STATUS VCF0116
-------------------

ALL YEARS (1972 and later) EXC. 2002:
Rs who were housewives or students but who were also presently
working more than 20 hrs. per week were considered "working now."
If the student/housewife was working less than 20 hrs per week,
s/he has been coded 7 or 8.

RETIRED AND DISABLED PERSONS 1972-1978:
If R volunteered that he/she was currently working but indicated 
that his/her current job was unrelated to his/her prior job 
(before retirement/disablement), then R was considered "retired" 
or "disabled" in these years and was only asked about past 
employment; however, if R volunteered that he/she was currently
working but indicated that his/her current job was related to 
his/her prior job then R was considered "working now" and was
asked only about current employment. [Note: questions determining
the relationship between past and current employment were not
specifically coded in the original study data but were represented
in the study's summary variable.]

RETIRED AND PERMANENTLY DISABLED PERSONS 1980 and later (exc. 2002):
Retirees were included in "working now" status if working at
least 20 hours per week.  In 1984-1986, information whether a
retired or disabled R was currently employed was obtained only if 
volunteered by the respondent; in 1982 and 1988-later (except 
2002), the retired and disabled were asked if they were currently  
working for pay, and, if so, the "working now" series of questions 
were  administered to determine number of hours.  In 1980 the 
retired were asked if they were currently working for pay and, 
if so, whether they were working more than 20 hours per week.

2002 FRESH CROSS:
In 2002, a summary variable was produced for the combined sample
of panel and fresh cross cases and this variable has been recoded
from the summary as follows: 
coded 1: working now; working now and retired; working now and 
homemaker; working now and student; working how, retired, and 
homemaker; working now, homemaker, and student
coded 2: temporarily laid off; temporarily laid off and homemaker
coded 4: unemployed; unemployed and retired; unemployed and
homemaker
coded 5: retired; retired and permanently disabled; retired
and homemaker; retired and student; retired, homemaker, and
student
coded 6: permanently disabled; unemployed and permanently disabled
coded 7: homemaker
coded 8: student; homemaker and student


WORK STATUS VCF0118
-------------------

HOMEMAKERS/STUDENTS 1972 and later:
Rs who were housewives or students but who were also presently
working more than 20 hours per week were considered "employed."
If the student/housewife was working less than 20 hrs per week,
s/he has been coded 4 or 5.

RETIRED AND DISABLED PERSONS 1972-1978:
If R volunteered presently working but his/her current job was 
unre-lated to his/her prior job before retirement/disablement, 
then R has been coded as "retired" (code 3) or "disabled" (code 2);
however, if R's current job was related to his/her prior job,
s/he has been coded as still "employed" (code 1).

RETIRED PERSONS 1980 and later:
Retirees were included in the "employed" status if working at
least 20 hours per week.

PERMANENTLY DISABLED PERSONS, 1980:
Those categorized as  permanently disabled were not considered
working (code 2).  If a disabled person volunteered that they
were working, they were coded in "employed."

PERMANENTLY DISABLED PERSONS 1982 and later:
The permanently disabled were considered "employed" (not "perman-
ently disabled") if presently working at least 20 hours per week.

1970 NOTE:
Those who identified themselves as "employed" appear in code 1.
Those who identified selves as "student" or "housewife" have been
coded as such, even if they also had a job.  The retired were not
asked about current employment.

1968 NOTE:
Those who identified themselves as "employed" appear in code 1.
Those who identified selves as "student" or "housewife" have been
coded as such, even if they also had a job--unless the student was
a full-time worker during the day and a student at night, in which
case R has been coded 1.

1952-1964 NOTE:
Except for 1952, if R was a housewife who also worked part time,
then R was not coded "housewife" but was considered "employed."
In the same years (1956-1964), if R was a student who worked in the
daytime (full or part time) but attended school at night, then R
was considered "employed;" if R attended school during the day (full
or part time), then R was considered a "student" (code 5).  In 1952,
only full-time employment was used to code Rs as employed (code 1).
Consequently, students or housewives from the 1952 study who also
worked part time appear in codes 4 or 5.


'TEMPORARILY LAID OFF' NOTE:
'Temporarily laid off' appeared as a separate category in original
data only since 1972.  In most previous years, references to layoff
did not distinguish between permanent layoff (unemployed) and
temporary layoff.  'Temporarily laid off' has been recoded to code 2 
here in order to obtain as much consistency as possible with earlier 
years' general layoff usage.

MISSING DATA NOTE:
The 1954, 1962, and 1966 (occupation) variables have not been used
in this set since they only described Rs who were household heads.

>> MOST IMPORTANT PROBLEM NOTE


     GENERAL NOTES:

     FOR ALL YEARS SINCE 1960 WHICH UTILIZED THE 'MOST IMPORTANT
     PROBLEM' QUESTION, THE MAJOR GROUPINGS AND THEIR RECODES TO CUMULATIVE
     DATA FILE VARIABLE V875 (with some exceptions) ARE AS FOLLOW:

            CDF V875   Original Codes     Subject grouping

                4         800-899       functioning of government

     In years 1960-1972 continuity of coding during successive years was
     not maintained.  Beginning in 1974, however, a set of codes was created
     which was reused each following year without renumbering or dropping of
     codes:  the only changes made to the 1974-based set of codes until 1988
     were, where need arose, expansions of individual code texts and insertion
     of additional codes (e.g. for 'new' issues).  In 1988 this set of
     1974-based codes underwent comprehensive review [see part 2].

     Part 1 below covers years 1960-1972.  During 1960-1966, code numbering
     was generally mutually exclusive between study years.  Beginning in
     1968, some previous codes (number and/or text) were reused.

>> II. MOST IMPORTANT PROBLEM 1974 - LATER


1974-BASED CODES:  In 1974, a set of 'most important problem' codes was
created with a numbering scheme following 1960-1972 general groupings,
but specific codes were not necessarily related to individual codes from any
years 1960-1972. During years 1976-1986, some codes within this 1974-based set
were revised in text (usually augmented), and some codes were added when need
arose, but no categories were dropped.

1988 REVIEW OF CODES:  In 1988, prior to the coding of that year's study
data, the existing set of 'most important problem' codes underwent a
comprehensive review, resulting in deletion of all categories with a history
of "too few mentions" since 1974.  There was, as well, a rewording/revision of
many codes and combining of others.  Since 1988, codes have been added or
revised/ augmented only where necessary to process data describing very
current issues.

'RETIRED CODES':  Unless indicated differently (i.e., for merged codes),
individual categories NOT continued in 1988 ('retired') were terminated due to
"too few mentions."  Note that the total number of mentions prior to 1988
(1974-1986 inclusive) appears in parentheses following the text of the
'retired' code.

CONTINUING CODES (not 'retired'):  For codes unretired or new in 1988, a
code text not followed by a date in brackets indicates the 1988 version of the
code.  The code may have been created at any time 1974-1988; if variations in
code text preceded the 1988 version, texts of earlier versions of code also
appear in parentheses.  * indicates that the code was created in 1974.  Codes
surviving the 1988 review which were created after 1974 have year of
origination in brackets [ ].  Any changes made to text after 1988 are noted
with date of change.
