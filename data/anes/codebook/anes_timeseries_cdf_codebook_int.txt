>> CUMULATIVE DATA FILE - GENERAL INTRODUCTION

     The Cumulative Data File consists of variables derived from the 1948-2016
series of biennial ("time-series") SRC/CPS National Election Studies.
[NOTE:  No ANES study was conducted in 1950; 1954 was a minor study although
its data are included here.]

     To produce this dataset, cross-section cases from the time-series
election studies have been pooled; the total unweighted cross-section N is
46,226.  (NOTE:  non-cross-section cases from black supplements in 1964, 
1968 and 1970 are not included in this file.) 

     A variable in the dataset almost always represents a question which
has been asked in three or more (time-series) studies.  This dataset
incorporates for specific questions data from all time-series studies in
which the question was asked in comparable fashion.

     When using variables from this dataset, the analyst should keep the following in mind:  

  1) Question wording has varied over the years.  Where there are 
     differences in question wording, we have tried to reference them 
     in the documentation; completeness of this effort, however, cannot
     be guaranteed. 
  2) Even if a question is worded identically in successive surveys, its
     placement in the survey instrument may be different, with unknown (and
     possibly large) effect. 
  3) Variables have been recoded to be consistent over time. Questions are not
     necessarily coded the same way in this dataset as they are in the
     election study datasets from which they came.



               THE SAMPLE SIZES FOR ALL YEARS ARE AS FOLLOWS:

* 	1970 numbers exclude 73 non-eligible Rs in the original dataset's
   	cross-section N.  The Cumulative File excludes all non-eligible
      respondents from its cross-section.  For descriptions of type 0, 
      type 1, and type 2 variables in 1970, see weight vars VCF0009-
      VCF0011.

** 	Weighted cross-section Ns are represented in the Guide to Public
   	Opinion and Electoral Behavior, which was produced using data from 
      The Cumulative File.  To reproduce the data appearing in the 
      GPOEB, it is necessary to use appropriate weights (see VCF0009-
      VCF0011).

NOTE: Weighting 1994 and later are post-stratified and centered to a mean of 1.
