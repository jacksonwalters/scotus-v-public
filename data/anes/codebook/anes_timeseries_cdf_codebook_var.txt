VCF0006a	

Unique Respondent Number (Cross-year ID for panel cases)

QUESTION:
---------
Unique identification number

NOTES:
------
GENERAL NOTE:
For non-panel cases this corresponds to 4-digit year of study followed
by 4-digit case id from the study as found in VCF0006.
For panel cases, this corresponds to 4-digit year of first year of
time-series participation followed by 4-digit case id from first
participation study .  For example, 1958 ANES panel cases (first
interviewed in the 1956 anes) are numbered 1956xxxx where xxxx
corresponds to the case ID the respondent had been assigned previously
in the 1956 study; VCF0006, by contrast, includes the respondent's 1958
ANES case ID.
Studies including panel cases as part of the overall study cross-section
are flagged in VCF00016.
1958 NOTE:
In the 1958 anes time-series study, V580007 and V580008 flags whether
1958 respondents were previously interviewed in 1956.  However, some
respondents flagged in these variables had been interviewed in 1956 not
as part of the 1956 anes study's cross-section sample, but as part of a
sample component intended for a separate 'panel' (non-cross-section)
file.  Thus the actual count of cases from the 1958 study having 1956
unique IDs in VCF0006a (as 1956xxxx, where xxxx is the 1956 ANES
cross-section case ID) does not correspond with the count of cases
flagged in V580007 and V580008 for previous participation in 1956.
1960 NOTE:
see 1958 NOTE; cases flagged in the 1960 ANES study for participation
prior to 1960 may have participated outside of the time-series cross-
section(s) in the year(s) of prior participation and may not correspond
to the count of cases found here for initial time-series participation.

NOTES:
------
GENERAL NOTE:
See also VCF0012A, VCF0012B.  This describes paper questionnaires
(1948-1994).
1972 NOTE 1:
57 Rs who were Pre Form I and 37 Rs who were Pre Form II were sent post
mail questionnaires that contained most, but not all, of Form I/ Form
II Post personal questions.  Rs who were Form I in the Pre but
administered Post mail questionnaires were designated 'FORM III' in the
Post, while Rs who were Form II in the Pre but who completed mail
questionnaires for the Post were Post 'FORM  IV'.
1972 NOTE 2:
The same Form type was assigned in the Post as in the Pre.
1986 NOTE:
Form A questions were not asked of Form B respondents and vice versa,
with two exceptions: both were asked VCF0830, with varied wording.
1988 NOTE 1:
Unlike other years, in 1988 all questions were present in both Form A
and Form B, however some differed by form in wording or placement: e.g.
VCF0517-VCF0518, VCF0830, VCF9076, VCF9084, VCF9092.
1988 NOTE 2:
same as 1972 NOTE 2.
1994 NOTE:
In 1994, the study included a 'ballot card' experiment.  Two ballot
cards were drafted with identical content but different layout.

1. Post-election interview data present

NOTES:
------
GENERAL NOTE:
This describes the presence of post-election data in ANES pre-post
time-series studies: studies conducted in years of presidential
elections and in 2002 were pre-post studies. In non-presidential years
except 1954 and 2002, ANES has conducted a Post-election interview only,
and all non-presidential years other than 1954 and 2002 have been coded
1.*  2002 is the only non-presidential-year study which is a Pre-Post
study.

VCF9027.
1956 NOTE:
No cases without post-election re-interviews were included in the
final 1956 dataset.
1968 NOTE:
9 cases which were no-Post had some information about voting
behavior NOTEd on their coversheets:  although defined as 'no-Post,'
these cases were nonetheless represented in (post) vote variables in
the original dataset, and such coversheet-derived vote information has
also been included in Cumulative Data File voting variables where
appropriate.
**ALL YEARS 2002-2008:
Post variable numbering begins Vxx5001, where xx is the 2-digit year
of the time-series study.

NOTES:
------
1980 NOTE:
Abbreviated Pre interviews were administered as replacements for
discovered 'fake' interviews.
1992 NOTE:
In addition to 'long-form' or full personal mode questionnaires, short-
form telephone questionnaires were prepared in both the Pre and Post
waves for out-of-range panel cases.  Please see the full 1992 ANES
documentation for a complete description. NOTE that, contrary to
intentions, use of the short-form questionnaire was not limited to
telephone mode, nor was long-form use confined to personal mode. [In
a few cases the shorter interview was administered to 'fresh' cross-
section respondents-- 4 cases Pre, 4 cases Post].
1996 NOTE:
The Pre 'VQ file' or CAPI application was revised several times while
in the field.  Beginning with the instrument with revision date 9/25/96,
some questions (most of the items related to 1996 candidate Ross Perot)
were dropped from the Pre.
2000 NOTE:
In the Pre, Buchanan traits and affects were dropped beginning with
the 09/28/00 VQ.

NOTES:
------
1952 NOTE:
In 1952 some respondents were sent an extended version of the post
questionnaire ('form B'); cases not administered this extended Post
re-interview are coded 1.
1968 NOTE:
In the 1968 post, some respondents were sent mail questionnaires which
contained fewer questions than in the full face-to-face questionnaire.
1972 NOTE:
In the 1972 post, some respondents were sent mail questionnaires which
contained fewer questions than in the full face-to-face questionnaire:
respondents who were Form I in the Pre (see VCF0012) and who were
interviewed in the Post using the mail questionnaire were designated
'Form III' in the Post; respondents who were Form II in the Pre and who
were interviewed in the Post using the mail questionnaire were
designated 'Form IV' in the Post
1984 NOTE:
In addition to the 1984 telephone Post questionnaire, which was shorter
than the 1984 Post personal questionnaire, an abbreviated version of the
Post telephone questionnaire was also administered to 45 cases.
1992 NOTE:
In addition to 'long-form' or full personal mode questionnaires, short-
form telephone questionnaires were prepared in both the Pre and Post
waves for out-of-range panel cases.  Please see the full 1992 ANES
documentation for a complete description. NOTE that, contrary to

telephone mode, nor was long-form use confined to personal mode. [In
a few cases the shorter interview was administered to 'fresh' cross-
section respondents-- 4 cases Pre, 4 cases Post].
1996 NOTE:
The Post 'VQ file' or CAPI application was revised several times while
in the field.  Some cases in the Post were mistakenly administered
using a pre-production (training) VQ file which lacked several
intended questions.

QUESTION:
---------
Sample component: 'new' cross-section or panel case

VALID CODES:
------------
0. Fresh Cross case
1. Panel case (1958 N=866;  1960 N=939;  1974 N=1100;
               1976 N=925;  1992 N=1359; 1994 N=759;
               1996 N=1316; 2002 N=1187)

NOTES:
------
GENERAL NOTE:
Code-level Ns indicated are unweighted. The combined sample of panel and
fresh-cross cases together constitute an overall representative cross-
section for the time-series study.  Panel cases in 1958,1960,1974 and
1976 are not flagged in the data of the respective time-series studies;
for these years this variable has been coded from the 1956-1958-1960
and 1972-1974-1976 merged panel files.
1958 NOTE:
Panel cases had previously been interviewed in 1956 ( NOTE: the number
of panel cases in the 1958 time-series data file does not correspond with
the number of 1958 panel cases in the 1956-1958-1960 merged panel file)
1960 NOTE:
Panel cases had previously been interviewed in 1956 or 1958 ( NOTE: the
number of panel cases in the 1950 time-series data file does not
correspond with the number of 1950 panel cases in the 1956-1958-1960
merged panel file)
1974 NOTE:
Panel cases had previously been interviewed in 1972 ( NOTE: the number
of panel cases in the 1974 time-series data file does not correspond with
the number of 1974 panel cases in the 1972-1974-1976 merged panel file)
1976 NOTE:
Panel cases had previously been interviewed in 1972 or 1974 ( NOTE: the
number of panel cases in the 1975 time-series data file does not
correspond with the number of 1976 panel cases in the 1972-1974-1976
merged panel file)
1992 NOTE:
Panel cases had previously been interviewed in 1990.
1994 NOTE:
Panel cases had previously been interviewed in 1992, as 1992 new fresh
Cross-Section cases (no 1994 Panel cases had been interviewed in 1990).
1996 NOTE:
Panel cases had previously been interviewed in 1994, and a portion had
also been interviewed in 1992.
2002 NOTE:
Panel cases had previously been interviewed in 2000.

Mode of Interview

QUESTION:
---------
Mode of interview

VALID CODES:
------------
0. All personal (pre-post studies: personal pre and post
     or personal pre and no post; post-only studies:
     personal post)
1. Telephone pre (personal post or no post)
2. Telephone post (personal pre)
3. All telephone (pre-post studies: pre and post [no post-only
     telephone studies in Time Series])
4. All internet (pre-post studies: internet pre and post
     or internet pre and no post; post-only studies:
     internet post)

NOTES:
------
1992 NOTE:
A shorter questionnaire was designed for telephone interviewing only,
where telephone administration was intended for selected Panel cases;
all long-form questionnaires were designed to be administered in
person.  However, due to interviewer misunderstanding, 125 Pre
interviews and 284 Post interviews -- including both Panel and new
Cross-Section respondents --were administered over the telephone using
long-form questionnaires.  Mode of interview here thus cannot be
identified with short or long questionnaire (VCF0015a,VCF0015b).  [ NOTE:
additionally, in 1 Pre case a Panel short-form interview was conducted
in person.]
1998 NOTE:
This is the beginning mode of the interview; in some cases, the
interview may have been suspended and completed in a different mode.
2000 NOTE:
Code 1 includes 5 cases which were personal in the Pre and intended to
be switched to phone mode in the Post, but which were again
administered face-to-face.

NOTES:
------
GENERAL NOTE:
Prior to 1964 this appeared as a coded staff summary (not as a survey
question).
Except for 1968, in Pre-Post studies this variable is pre-election.
Beginning in 1964, age variables in ANES Study datasets were created by
computing R's age from his/her given date of birth (beginning in 1988,
when birthdate was not available, age as given for household listing by
R/informant was used instead).  The age calculation used in these
Study datasets determined age at date of interview  in 1966, 1968,
1970, 1972 and 1980-1994; it represented age on November 1 of the year
of interview in 1976 and 1978.  In 1974, age on election day  of the
year of interview was calculated.  For 1964, no documentation is extant
describing exact calculation made.
Prior to 1964, instead of age calculated using R's birthdate, age
as given by R/informant (this information may have come from the
coversheet) is represented.
1948 NOTE:
Age var was in the form of age groups and could not be included (see
VCF0102).
1954 NOTE:
same as 1948.
1960 NOTE:
Personal data forms were completed for no-pre cases: data from these

GENERAL NOTE:
See also VCF0108.
Respondent booklet is shown to R (exc. 2000 telephone and 2002:) .
Beginning in 1988, the respondent was asked within the series of
ethnicity questions [SEE VCF0109] whether s/he is Hispanic.  Prior to
1988, information about Hispanic origin was determined only by
interviewer observation.
1978 NOTE:
A large number (171) of NAs appeared in the Study data.
1980 NOTE:
A Hispanic origin variable was present in both the pre and post.  The
pre version is represented here.
1984 NOTE:
same as 1980
1992 NOTE:
This was not part of the 'short-form' questionnaire; for short-form
panel cases, however, 1990 study data were incorporated.
1994 NOTE:
For panel cases, 1992 data were incorporated.
2002 NOTE:
For panel cases, 2000 data were incorporated.
2004 NOTE:
A question on Hispanic identity of household members was also
administered as part of the screener (household listing).  Data for
the screener identification of Hispanic status are found separately
in the 2008 Time Series study data; screener Hispanic status was
used in the construction of the 2008 study weights.
2012 NOTE:
Respondents are coded 1 or 2 if they gave one mention as Mexican/
Mexican-American/Chicano or as Puerto Rican, or else if they gave
multiple mentions but identified their closest group as one of those.
2016 NOTE:
Respondents are coded 1 or 2 if they gave one mention for country 
of origin as Mexico or Puerto Rico, or else if they gave more than
one mention for country of origin but identified Mexico or Puerto
Rico as the country from which 'most' of their family came. Respondents
who gave more than one mention but who did not choose Mexico or
Puerto Rico as the country from which most of their family came 
are coded 3. Respondents who identified themselves as Hispanic 
but who did not mention any country other than U.S.A. are coded 4.

QUESTION:
---------
In addition to being an American what do you consider your main
ethnic group or nationality group?
(IF MORE THAN 1 GROUP MENTIONED: ) With which of these groups do you
most closely identify?

VALID CODES:
------------
010-874. Ethnicity as coded

MISSING CODES:
--------------
877.'American'; 'Just American'; none; neither
     (response to 'choice' question); NA
888. DK
000. Short-form 'new' Cross Section (1992)
INAP. question not used

NOTES:
------
GENERAL NOTE:
See ethnicicty codes- Appendix 'ETHNICITY'
This represents the single mention of respondents who indicated only
1 ethnic group and the 'most close' group (followup question) of
respondents who indicated more than 1 ethnic group.
There is no code to single out Rs who volunteered to assert their
'American' identity.  This is because in most years these Rs were
combined with NA and/or 'none' (no ethnic identity).
1978 NOTE:
A version of this question which included a (filter) lead-in was used:
'In addition to being an American, is there another nationality group
or ethnic group that you feel you belong to?   [IF YES]  What...'
Because of this format, the 1978 distributions varied dramatically from
other years, and 1978 data have not been included.
1992 NOTE:
This was not part of the 'short-form' questionnaire; for short-form
panel cases, however, 1990 study data were incorporated.
1994 NOTE:
For panel cases, 1992 data were incorporated.
1996 NOTE:
In a few cases R identified 2 or more nationality/ethnicity groups but
the interviewer did not ask the 'choice' followup (due to incorrect
completion of the IWR checkpoint); since R's chosen nationality/
ethnicity remained undetermined, these cases (30) were considered
missing data (code 99 here).
2004 NOTE:
For respondents who gave multiple mentions but did not choose one
ethnic group as closest, 1st mention is coded.
2008 NOTE:
For respondents who gave multiple mentions but did not choose one
ethnic group as closest, 1st mention is coded.
2012 NOTE:
Beginning with 2012, data for this question have been considered 
confidential.

NOTES:
------
GENERAL NOTE:
See Appendix 'INCOME' for income ranges corresponding to these
percentiles.
Study coding of income was approximated as closely as possible to fit
within this version.  Prior to 1972, this was an estimate of CURRENT
year's income; since 1972, PREVIOUS year's income.  NOTE that in all
years beginning 1976 this question was not actually asked if R was the
only household member age 14 or over: in such cases, data from the
question asking R's own income was duplicated. (Prior to 1976 R's
own income was not determined.)
Beginning in 1964, R was shown a respondent card or booklet.
1948 NOTE:
Question wording was undocumented.
1960 NOTE:
Personal data forms were completed for no-pre cases: data from
these forms were incorporated.
1996 NOTE:
For 14 cases, interviewers entered responses where individual income
was higher than family income.  In some of these cases, the responses
for family income and R income may have been provided.entered in
incorrect order.
1998 NOTE:
Some interviewers coded lowest income category when the respondent
stated that he or she did not know what the household income was.
Study staff has reviewed all interviewer comment material available to
identify cases coded in the lowest category where comment NOTEs clearly
indicate Don't Know; such cases have been recoded to DK.  However, it
is not known whether there are additional DK cases (without recorded
comments) for which lowest category had been incorrectly coded.
2002 NOTE:
Income categories were too broad for approximation here.
2012 NOTE:
Income range was included in the public release. Percentile group
represents full (combined) 2012 sample, including both in-person
(FTF) and Web respondents.
2016 NOTE:
Same as 2012.

Catholic, Jewish or what?

MISSING CODES:
--------------
0. NA; no Pre IW; no Post IW; short-form 'new' Cross Section (1992)
INAP. question not used

NOTES:
------
GENERAL NOTE:
See also VCF0129 and VCF0152.
In all Pre-Post studies except 1960 this was a Pre var.
This has been collapsed from the Study variable summarizing R's
religious self-identification, constructed from the complete set of
questions asked, usually including questions additional to those
documented here (see questions per VCF0128b,VCF0129).
1990-later (exc. 2002) NOTE:
Questions about religious affiliation were preceded by the filter
question, 'Lots of things come up that keep people from attending
religious services even if they want to.
Thinking about your life these days, do you ever attend religious
services, apart from occasional weddings, baptisms or funerals?'
(SEE VCF0130), which had some effect on distributions.
1948 NOTE:
Question wording was undocumented.
1992 NOTE:
This question was not part of the 'short-form' questionnaire; for short-
form panel cases, however, 1990 study data were incorporated.
1994 NOTE:
For panel cases, 1992 data were incorporated.
2002 NOTE:
For panel cases, 2000 data were incorporated.
2012 NOTE:
In 2012, cases categorized as 'undifferentiated Christian' in the
major-group summary are coded 4.

NOTES:
------
GENERAL NOTE:
See Appendix '2002 RELIGION NOTE'.
See also VCF0152.
These questions follow up questions in VCF0128.
The addition in 1972 of 'Is that Southern Baptist or something else?'
significantly changed distributions of Protestant Baptists beginning in
that year.
Beginning in 1990 (except 2002), the full set of religion codes was
expanded considerably, adding codes for different affiliations within
the major mainline Protestant denominations and reworking almost
entirely the Pentecostal, Holiness, fundamentalist, and evangelical
Protestant denominations.  VCF0152 gives the 'new' set of full
codes.
2002 NOTE:
2000 data were included in the 2002 study religion summary variable by
recoding from the 2000 study variable, which differed somewhat in
coding from that used for 2002 fresh cross-section cases.  A
description of the recode from the 2002 summary variable is provided in
the Appendix.

1970-1988: (IF ANY RELIGIOUS PREFERENCE) Would you say you/do you go
to (church/synagogue) every week, almost every week, once or twice a
month, a few times a year, or never?
1990 AND LATER:  Lots of things come up that keep people from
attending religious services even if they want to.  Thinking about
your life these days, do you ever attend religious services, apart
from occasional weddings, baptisms or funerals?  (IF YES:) Do you go
to religious services every week, almost every week, once or twice a
month, a few times a year, or never?

VALID CODES:

INAP. question not used

NOTES:
------
GENERAL NOTE:
Beginning in 1990, question flow was reversed so that the religious
attendance question preceded religious affiliation questions, whereas
in previous studies religious attendance followed.  Beginning in 1990,
frequency of religious attendance was preceded by a general attendance
filter (yes/no); a 'no' response to the filter 1990 and later has been
coded 5 here.
1970 NOTE:
Only codes corresponding to VCF0130 codes 2-5 were used (no code for
'every week'). 'Almost every week' from 1970 has been recoded to 1,
with no 1970 cases appearing in code 2.
1992 NOTE:
This question was not part of the 'short-form' questionnaire; for short-
form panel cases, however, 1990 study data were incorporated.
1994 NOTE:
For Panel respondents,1992 data have been included.

To reconcile  the original 1958 Study data, Rs who did not grow up in
the U.S. (and who were not asked this question) were coded into
generalized foreign codes, e.g., 'Central America,' 'Eastern Europe,'
etc., based upon parents' foreign origins according to information
obtained in questions about places of mother's and father's birth

thus have been coded for the study  into a size category different from
the size description chosen by R in his/her answer.  'City' categories
by population during these years were (in general): under 10,000;
10,000-50,000; 100,000-250,000;  250,000+.  For the codes here, the
250,000+ category was  placed into 'large city', while lesser-
population cities were included in code 3.
In 1966-1976, R's own perception of size of community was used.

1970 and for these years have been recoded to code 199, United States.
Parents of foreign-born Rs were also present in missing data during
these years in the study datasets, but for this variable parental
birthplaces have been imputed from R's own birth-place, as a
generalized category e.g., 'British  Isles' if R were born in England).

Interviewer instruction 1990 and later:  'If spouse is in a nursing
home or works in another city, or the family is in the process of
moving and is temporarily holding 2 residences, code 1 is used.'
1952 NOTE:
Rs who were not married have been recoded to NA because their specific
status as divorced, widowed, never married etc. was not determined.  Rs
married at the time of the 1952 interview have all been coded 1 in
VCF0147, with no 1952 cases appearing in codes 2-7.

This question was not part of the 'short-form' questionnaire; for short-
form panel cases, however, 1990 study data were incorporated, except in
cases where additional information current to 1992 [as determined by the
interviewer] contradicted the marital status of 1990.  In the latter
instances, the 1992 marital status variable was coded to reflect the
most complete and up-to-date information known by the interviewer.
2002 NOTE:
For panel cases, 2000 data were included.
2008 NOTE:
This question was asked in 2 versions; data are combined in this
variable.

the followup that asked the respondent, if R 'had to make a choice,'

refused or did not answer the initial question were also asked the choice 
question (2012,2008,2004,2000,1990 and 1 post Web respondent in 2016).
In 2000 only, respondents who answered Yes to the initial question but 
who gave an Other response to the followup 'Which one?' were asked the 
choice question.
Respondents who volunteered upper or lower class in response to any of 
the questions have been coded as such here (0 or 7). 
1992 NOTE:
This set of questions was not part of the 'short-form' questionnaire;
for short-form panel cases, however, 1990 study data were incorporated
in the 1992 summary var.
2000 NOTE:
The 2000 summary variable used here appropriately coded into its 
categories the open-end Other Specify responses corresponding to lower, 
working, middle or upper class. The 2000 summary variable categories are
the same as in VCF0148.
2016 NOTE:
In 2016, a half sample of respondents were asked this 4-question version for social class in the pre-election wave and the remaining half sample
were asked in the post.

QUESTION:
---------

GROUP THERMOMETER INTRO

1964-1968: 
There are many groups in America that try to get the government or the
American people to see things more their way.  We would like to get
your feelings towards some of these groups.  I have here a card on
which there is something that looks like a thermometer.  We call it a
'feeling thermometer' because it measures your feelings towards
groups. Here's how it works. If you don't know too much about a group
or don't feel particularly warm or cold toward them, then you should
place them in the middle, at the 50 degree mark.  If you have a warm
feeling toward a group or feel favorably toward it, you would give it
a score somewhere between 50 degrees and 100 degrees, depending on how
warm your feeling is toward the group.  On the other hand, if you
don't feel very favorably toward some of these groups--if there are
some you don't care for too much--then you would place them somewhere
between 0 degrees and 50 degrees.
1970-1974:
(1970: As you know, there are many groups and persons in America that
try to get the government or the American people to see things more
their way. Please use the thermometer again--this time to indicate
your feelings toward these groups or persons.)  (1972,1974: We'd also
like to get your feelings about some groups in American society, using
the feeling thermometer just as we did for the [1972: candidates;
1974: leaders]. If we come to a group you don't know much about, just
tell me and we'll move on to the next one.)  
1976: 
We'd also like to get your feelings about some groups in American 
society.  When I read the name of a group, we'd like you to rate it with 
what we call a feeling thermometer.  Ratings between 50 degrees-100 
degrees mean that you feel favorably and warm toward the group; ratings 
between 0 and 50 degrees mean that you don't feel favorably towards the 
group and that you don't care too much for that group.  If you don't 
feel particularly warm or cold toward a group you would rate them at 50 
degrees.  If we come to a group you don't know much about, just tell me 
and we'll move on to the next one.
1978-1984:  
(1980-1984: And still using the thermometer, how would you rate the 
following.)  
1986-LATER:  
([And] still using the thermometer, how would you rate [the following]:)

NOTES:
------
GENERAL NOTE FOR ALL GROUP THERMOMETERS:
Card or respondent booklet shown to R exc. 2000 telephone and 2002 
(telephone study).
Code distinction between 'don't know' and non-recognition of name
begin in 1978; data are combined in the DK category here.
In all Pre-Post study years except 1968 and 1976, group thermometers
followed (within the same wave, if not immediately) the series of 
thermometers for specific political figures, so that R was asked to 
recall the 'explanation' of the thermometer.  In 1968 and 1976 only, 
group thermometers appeared in a separate wave.
1964 NOTE:
'Don't knows' were coded 50 on thermometers; groups about which the 
respondent 'didn't know much' were also placed at 50 degrees
1966 NOTE:
same as 1964.
1968 NOTE:
same as 1964.
1970 NOTE:
The  order in which group thermometers were asked varied by form.
1970-1976 NOTE:
The respondent was not asked to give thermometer ratings for groups 
about which R 'didn't know much' or 'didn't know too much.'  However, 
it is unclear whether such cases were coded DK or NA.
1996-LATER NOTE:
Group thermometers were administered in random order.

Only 3 mentions were included in the 1972 ANES dataset release.
Note that VCF0314, which was created in the 1970s, was originally coded
tallying a count of all 1972 mentions, including those (not extant)
which were not part of the 1972 ANES release file.  However, only the 3
released mentions are represented in this file.
2008 SPECIAL NOTE:
Master codes were under revision for the 2008 Time Series Study and
are not available at the time of this release (for the ANES Time Series
Cumulative Data File). It is currently unclear how the new codes will
integrate with this file.
2012 NOTE:
Party-candidate codes have not yet been coded for the 2012 Time Series.
It is unclear how the new coding will integrate with this file.

QUESTION:
---------
POLITICAL FIGURE THERMOMETER INTRO

1968-1974:  
(1968,1972: As you know, there were many people mentioned this past year 
as possible  candidates for President [1972: or Vice-President] by the 
political parties.)  
(1970: Several political leaders have already been mentioned as possible 
candidates for President in 1972.)  
(1968-1972: We would like to get your feelings toward some of these 
people.) 
(1974: Now I'd like to get your feelings toward some of our political 
leaders and other people who are in the news these days.)
I have here a card on which there is something that looks like a 
thermometer.  We call it a "feeling thermometer" because it measures  
your feelings toward these people. (1968: You probably remember that we 
used something like this in our earlier interview with you.) 
Here's how it works.  If you don't feel particularly warm or cold toward 
a person, then you should place him in the middle of the thermometer, at 
the 50 degree mark.  If you have a warm feeling toward him or feel 
favorably toward him, you would give him a score somewhere between 50 
degrees and  100 degrees. (1968-1970 only: depending on how warm your 
feeling is toward that person).  On the other hand, if you don't feel 
very favorably toward a person--that is, if you don't care for him too 
much--then you would place him somewhere between 0 degrees and 50 
degrees. Of course, if you don't know too much about a person, just tell 
me and we'll go on to the next name.
1976:
As you know, many people were mentioned this year as possible candidates 
for president or vice-president by the political parties.  We would like 
to get your feelings toward some of these people. 
I'll read the name of each person and I'd like you to rate that person 
with what we call a feeling thermometer. Ratings between 50 and 100 
degrees mean that you feel favorably and warm toward the person, ratings 
between 0 and 50 degrees mean that you don't feel favorably towards the 
person and that you don't care too much for that person.  If you don't 
feel particularly warm or cold toward a person you would rate them at 50 
degrees.  If we come to a person you don't know much about, just tell me 
and we'll move on to the next one.
1978-LATER:  
I'd like to get your feelings toward some of our political leaders and 
other people who are in the news these days (1990: have been in the 
news).  I'll read the name of a person and I'd like you to rate that 
person using (1986-LATER: something we call) the feeling thermometer.  
Ratings between 50 and 100 (1986-LATER: degrees) mean that you feel 
favorably and warm toward the person; ratings between 0 and 50 degrees 
mean that you don't feel favorably toward the person and that you don't 
care too much for that person.  (1986-LATER: You would rate the person 
at the 50 degree mark if you don't feel particularly warm or cold toward 
the person.) If we come to a person whose name you don't recognize, you 
don't need to rate that person.  Just tell me and we'll move on to the 
next one. (1978-1984: If you do recognize the name, but you don't feel 
particularly warm or cold toward the person, then you would rate the 
person at the 50 degree mark.)

NOTES:
------
GENERAL  NOTE:
For study years where the same thermometer appeared in both the Pre and 
Post, the Pre data are used.
1968 NOTE:
"Don't know"s were coded 50 on thermometers; groups about which the 
respondent "didn't know much" were also placed at 50 degrees. The 50 
degree mark was labeled "50 degrees; no feeling".
1970 NOTE:
The order of names read varied by form.
1996 NOTE:
The order of thermometers for all individuals except Presidential 
candidates was randomized.  
1998 NOTE:
The order of thermometers for all individuals except the President
(first thermometer) was randomized.
2000 NOTE:
same as 1998
2002 NOTE:
Individual thermometers were administered in one of two possible 
orders, following President (first thermometer).
2004 NOTE:
The order of thermometers for all individuals except the president
(first thermometer) and Ronald Reagan, in retrospect (as the last/
14th thermometer) was randomized.  Overall randomization was devised
as a set of consecutive subrandomizations; major presidental candidates
thermometers other than then incumbent president were randomly
administered as the 2nd-3rd names, follwed by other political figures 
as the 4th-11th randomized thermometers.  Thermometers for the major
parties were randomly administered in the 12th-13th positions.

'no' (opinion) (1964,1976-1992,2000); 'no interest' (1968,1972); NA
(all years); 'DK' (all years).
Additionally, in 1964,1968,1972,1976,1988,1992,2000 if R replied 'yes,'
that R did have an interest/opinion BUT responded 'DK' or NA when
asked for that opinion, then R was not asked this question.
In 1988,1992,2000, among Rs who indicated that they had an opinion on
this issue, Respondents who were asked this question were limited to
Rs having their own opinions as one of the following: 1) The government
is too powerful; OR 2) The government is not getting too strong AND
(followup) the government should become more powerful.
1992 NOTE:
46 cases were not asked this question due to an error in skip

Approve Participation in Protests

QUESTION:

There are many possible ways for people to show their disapproval or
disagreement with governmental policies and actions.  I am going to
describe three such ways.  We would like to know which ones you
approve of as ways of showing dissatisfaction with the government and
which ones you disapprove of.

Did Respondent Vote in the National Elections

QUESTION:
---------
1948: 
In the election, about half the people voted and about half of
them didn't.  Did you vote?
1962:
One of the things we need to know is whether or not people really did
get to vote this fall.  In talking to people about the election we find
that a lot of people weren't able to vote because they weren't
registered or they were sick or something else came up at the last
minute.  Do you remember for sure whether or not you voted in the
November election?
1952-1960,1964-1998, 2002 VERSION 1, and 2004 VERSION 1:
In talking to people about the election we (1972 AND LATER: often) find
that a lot of people weren't able to vote because they weren't
registered or they were sick or they just didn't have time. (1956-1960:
How about you, did you vote this time?)  (1964-1970: How about you, did
you vote this time, or did something keep you from voting) (1972-1976:
How about you, did you vote in the elections this fall?) (1978 and
later: How about you, did you vote in the elections this November?)
2000, 2002 VERSION2, and 2004 VERSION 1: In talking to people about
elections, we often find that a lot of people were not able to vote
because they weren't registered, they were sick, or they just didn't
have time.  Which of the following statements best describes you:
One, I did not vote (in the election this November);
Two, I thought about voting this time - but didn't;
Three, I usually vote, but didn't this time; or
Four, I am sure I voted?

VALID CODES:

2. Yes, voted

GENERAL NOTE:
Code 2 includes 8 respondents from 1958, 8 respondents from 1962 and
14 respondents from 1968, who replied 'yes, I think so.'
1956 NOTE:
Code 2 includes 3 cases from:  'Nonvoter, NA preference; voted, but not
for president'.
1982 NOTE:
For congressional districts GA04 and GA05, an additional question
appeared:  How about the special US Congressional elections held
November 30th.  Did you vote in that election?  From 1982, code 2
includes all GA04, GA05 respondents who voted in either the November 2
general election or the November 30 special election, or both.
2002 NOTE:
Respondents were randomly assigned to either version 1 or version 2.

All respondents who reported voting have been coded 3, regardless of
whether they actually reported being registered.
No registration variable at all was present in 1958,1962,1966,1970 or

In some years a few respondents have declared that registration was not
required in their state; these cases have been included with

INAP. question not used

NOTES:
------
See also VCF0735,VCF0736,VCF1011-VCF1013
GENERAL NOTE:
The Ballot Card was introduced in 1978.
Note that VCF0707 and VCF0736 differ slightly from VCF1011-VCF1013 for
years prior to 1978: see VCF1011.
1952-1968:  When an 'incorrect' name--i.e., not on the list of
candidates which the interviewer had for R's congressional district--
was given with a party association, the party given was coded and is
represented here.  When a 'correct' name was given with an incorrect
party, however, the actual party associated with the named candidate
was coded in Study data: 'Smith, a Democrat' was coded as a Republican
if, in fact Smith was a Republican.  [In 1952-1968, party was asked for
only if R did not know the candidate name or gave an 'incorrect' name.
If R correctly named a candidate for his/her district without
volunteering party association, party was not asked for, and factual
party of candidate was coded.]  In 1958 ONLY, if the respondent gave
the correct name of a candidate from another race in R's district, then
R was informed of the named candidate's actual race and the question
for R's House vote was repeated.
In 1952, 1956, 1958, 1960, and 1964 this question was coded as a
multiple response allowing, when applicable, for candidate-at-large
mentions (2nd response) as well as district choice of candidates (1st
response).  Second responses were excluded in coding VCF0707.
1970-1976:  R's perception of candidate's party was coded.  If not
volunteered, party of candidate was always asked for.  If party
associated by R was not the actual party of a correctly named
candidate, party as mentioned was still coded. Even if an 'incorrect'
name (i.e., name not on the interviewer's list of candidate names--see
VCF1006 for description of lists) was given, party associated by R was
coded.
Ballot card 1978-1982, 1984 personal, 1986 and later: when R gave a
name not on the ballot card, the party of actual vote remained
undeterminable (0 in VCF0707), unless R voted outside district of
interview and R's major party vote from 'outside' district could be
established (if a recognizable name was given).
No ballot card 1980-later:  Respondents who had voted outside the
Congressional District of their sample selection location could not use
the Ballot Card, and question wording was altered somewhat. 1980 was
the first year that cases of 'outside' Congressional District voting
were identified.
1984 NOTE:
In Post telephone interviews, If the interviewer had the correct Ballot
Card at hand, then he or she attempted to read the names and party
affiliations of the House candidates [see question wording above].
1992 NOTE:
In telephone interviews, names were not read by the interviewer, but
attempt was made, in many cases, to leave ballot cards with respondents
if a telephone appointment was made.
1994 NOTE:
A 'ballot card' experiment was conducted; see VCF0012.
1996 NOTE:
same as 1992
2000 NOTE:
For respondents registered in county of interview, the order of
candidate names was randomized on the Ballot Card/as read by
interviewers.
2002 NOTE:
For respondents registered in county of interview, the order of
candidate names was randomized as read by interviewers.

See VCF0707 (Senate data coded in same manner as House data).
GENERAL NOTE:
1980-later cases administered without Ballot Card presentation include
respondents who had voted outside the state of their sample selection
location. 1980 was the first year that 'outside' voting was identified.
In California in 1992, in Tennessee in 1994, and in Kansas in 1996 the
regular Senate election and a second 'special' Senate election were
held.  This variable codes data for the respondent's vote in the
regular Senate election only.  [ NOTE special question wording was not
used for Tennessee in 1994].
2002 NOTE:
For respondents registered in county of interview, the order of
candidate names was randomized in text read by telephone interviewers.

for in the election for President?
1948:
On the coming Presidential election, do you plan to vote? (IF RESPONSE
NOT 'NO':)  Do you plan to vote Republican, Democrat or something else?
1992 and 1996:
We all know the election is some time away and people are not certain at
this point who they will vote for. Still, who do you think you will vote
for in the election for President?
2012 PRE-ELECTION: (IF R IS NOT REGISTERED BUT INTENDS TO REGISTER, OR
IF R IS REGISTERED BUT DID NOT VOTE YET:) How about the election for
President? Do you intend to vote for a candidate for PRESIDENT? (IF
YES:) Who do you think you will vote for? [DEM PRES CAND NAME], [REP
PRES CAND NAME], or someone else?

2. Republican candidate (with or without qualifications, 1952-1976)
3. Undecided; DK (except 1964)
4. R does not intend to vote (incl. 'no, qualified' if will vote, 1952-1976) 
     or does not intend to vote for President

NOTES:
------
GENERAL NOTE:
This is a pre var.
For 1952-1976, codes 1 and 3 also include presidential candidate vote
intentions 'with qualifications.'   Codes for candidate vote intention
'with qualifications' did not appear after 1976.
In 1952-1976, if R's response to the question 'As far as you know, do
you expect to vote in the elections this November?' was 'yes,
qualified' (think so/ guess so/ probably, etc.), R was asked this
question; if R's response was 'no, qualified' (probably not,  etc.)
R has been included in code 4; if R's response was 'pro-con,' then
this has been coded 0.
After 1976, no codes appeared for 'yes, qualified,' 'no, qualified,'
or 'pro-con'.

Number of Articles about Election Campaigns in Magazines

QUESTION:
---------
1952,1956,1960,1964,1968,1972,1976: 
We're (1952: mainly) interested in this interview in finding out whether
people paid much attention to the election campaign this year.  Take
newspapers for instance--did you read (1972 ONLY: much) about the
campaign in any newspaper?
1974:
(IF R READS A DAILY NEWSPAPER:) Did you read anything about the campaign
this year in any newspaper?
1978-1986,1990:
Did you read about the campaign in any newspapers?
1988,1992 AND LATER:
(IF R HAS READ A DAILY NEWSPAPER IN THE PAST WEEK:) Did you read about
the campaign in any newspaper?

VALID CODES:
------------
1. No, read no newspapers about the campaign
2. Yes, read newspaper(s) about the campaign

MISSING CODES:
--------------
0. DK; NA; no Post IW; split versions: not asked (2008); form II,III,IV
   (1972); abbrev. telephone IW (1984); DK/NA if R reads a daily newspaper 
   (1974); R did not read daily paper in past week (1988, 1992, 1996); 
   DK/NA if R read a daily paper in past week (1988, 1992, 1996); short 
   form or Spanish language (1992)
INAP. question not used

NOTES:
------
See VCF0724.
GENERAL NOTE:
In 1974, 1988 and 1992, this question was preceded by a filter. The
1974 filter was:  Do you read a daily newspaper?  In 1988 and 1992 the
filter was:  How many days in the past week did you read a daily
paper?  Rs who replied 'no' [1974] or 'none' [1988] to the filter
question were not asked this question.  However, 1974 Rs who replied
'no' have been coded 1 while 1988 and 1992 Rs who replied 'none' have
been coded 0.
In most years, this question was accompanied by a follow-up question
which asked how much/how often R read campaign articles, how many
campaign articles R read, or how much attention R paid to campaign
articles. If the respondent had read articles at all, regardless how
little, then R has been coded 2.  Several 1986, 1990, 1992, and 1996
respondents who replied 'yes' to the main question, but who replied in
the followup question that they paid 'no attention' to articles, have
still been coded 2.  From the 1980 and 1984 studies, however, several
respondents who answered 'yes' to the main question but who then
volunteered in the followup that they read 'no' articles have been
coded 1 rather than 2.  The 1974 and 1978 follow-up questions have
been disregarded.
1972 NOTE:
Addition of 'much' to wording affected distributions significantly.
2008 NOTE:
This question was administered to a random half sample of respondents
using verion 'OLD'; the remaining respondents were administered an
alternative version (version 'NEW') which was specific to the
Presidential campaign only.
2012 NOTE:
Wording in 2012 was not comparable ('campaign for President')

he/she voted 'a straight ticket' but no candidate for R's party ran;
it also includes cases where R insists that he/she voted for a
specific party's candidate but no candidate from that party ran in R's
district.  For Rs who voted outside district of interview location,
code 97 also includes candidates named by R but whose CD and party are
not known.  It also includes cases where R names a candidate but the
name is not among names of candidates within a known 'outside' CD.

GENERAL NOTE:
This is a post var, asked of voters and of registered non-voters (and
also asked of Rs who did not know if they voted but who stated that
they were registered).
For voter or registered nonvoter who stated that registration did not
require declaration of party in R's area or if R was a (reported) voter
who stated that voters were not required to register: 6 has been coded.
Nonvoter Rs who replied that voters were not required to register in
their area have been coded 9.  Nonvoter Rs who replied 'DK' or NA when
asked if they were registered have also been coded 9. Nonvoter Rs who
replied that they were registered but, when asked for party of
registration, replied that voters were not required to register in
their areas have been coded 9.
If R was a non-voter who first declared registration status but, when
asked for party registered, replied that R was not registered, 0 has
been coded.
Beginning in 2012, respondents were asked party of registration in both 
the Pre and Post. A future release of the CDF will provide a summary
variable for party of registration that is not wave specific.

INAP. question not used

NOTES:
------
GENERAL NOTE:
This index is constructed from the thermometer score for liberals
(VCF0211) and the thermometer score for conservatives (VCF0212).
The calculation used is the following:  First, the value of VCF0211 is
subtracted from 97, and that difference is added to the value of
VCF0212.  This sum is then divided by 2, and .5 is added to the
result.  Finally, the solution is truncated to obtain an integer
value.  If either VCF0211 or VCF0212 is 98, then VCF0801 is coded 98;
99 is coded in VCF0801 if it is the only missing data value coded
in VCF0211,VCF0212.

GENERAL NOTE:
For years 1984 and later, a follow-up 'choice' question was asked of
respondents who replied 'don't know' or 'haven't thought much' to this
question; except for years 1984, 1986 and 1990 this follow-up 'choice'
question was also asked of respondents who answered 'moderate.'  For
these years, a final 3-category summary was constructed:  the 'choice'
question is found in VCF0824; the final 3-category summary is VCF0849.
2000 NOTE:
This variable represents 7-point scale data from interviews conducted
using both modes (telephone and personal).
In addition to the traditional 7-point scale version of this question,
approximately half of the 2000 Study respondents (both modes) were
instead randomly selected for administration of a branching series.
2012 NOTE:
Due to an error in the technical specifications, option 'Haven't 
thought much about it' was not included in the web instrument; code 9
represents FTF cases only.

Government Assistance with Medical Care

QUESTION:
---------
1956,1960: 
Around election time people talk about different things that our
government in Washington is doing or should be doing.  Now I would like
to talk to you about some of the things that our government might do.
Of course, different things are important to different people, so we
don't expect everyone to have an opinion about all of these. I would
like you to look at this card as I read each question and  tell me how
you feel about the question.  If you don't have an opinion, just tell me
that; if you do have an opinion, choose one of the other answers.]
(CARD WITH RESPONSE CHOICES SHOWN TO R: AGREE STRONGLY/ AGREE BUT NOT
VERY STRONGLY/ NOT SURE, IT DEPENDS/DISAGREE BUT NOT VERY STRONGLY/
DISAGREE VERY STRONGLY).
'The government ought to help people get doctors and hospital care at
low cost.'
1962:
Now on a different problem. 'The government ought to help people get
doctors and hospital care at low cost.'  Do you have an opinion on this
or not?  (IF YES:) Do you agree that the government should do this or do
you think the government should not do it.
1964,1968:
Some say the government in Washington ought to help people get doctors
and hospital care at low cost; others say the government should not get
into this.  Have you been interested enough in this to favor one side
over the other?  (IF YES) What is your position?

Government Health Insurance Scale

QUESTION:
---------
There is much concern about the rapid rise in medical and hospital
costs.  Some (1988,1994-LATER: people) feel there should be a
government insurance plan which would cover all medical and hospital
expenses (1984 AND LATER: for everyone).  (1996,2004: Suppose these
people are at one end of a scale, at point 1). Others feel that
(1988,1994-1996: all) medical expenses should be paid by individuals,
and through private insurance (1984 AND LATER: plans) like Blue Cross
(1984-1994: or [1996:some] other company paid plans). (1996,2004:
Suppose these people are at the other end, at point 7.  And of course,
some people have opinions somewhere in between at points 2,3,4,5 or 6.)

If Compelled to Choose Liberal or Conservative

QUESTION:
---------
We hear a lot of talk these days about liberals and conservatives.
Here is (1972,1974: I'm going to show you) a 7-point scale on which
the political views that people might hold are arranged from extremely
liberal to extremely conservative.  Where would you place yourself on
this scale, or haven't you thought much about this? (7-POINT SCALE
SHOWN TO R).
(IF R RESPONDS 'DON'T KNOW' OR 'HAVEN'T THOUGHT MUCH ABOUT THIS' IN
1984 AND LATER; IF R RESPONDS 'MODERATE' IN 1988,1992,1996-LATER:)
If you had to choose, would you consider yourself a liberal or a
conservative?

VALID CODES:

1. Liberal
3. Moderate ('middle of the road') [VOL]
5. Conservative
7. R refuses to choose
8. DK

MISSING CODES:

   R not administered 7pt scale series (2000); no post IW
INAP. question not used

NOTES:
------
See also VCF0803 and VCF0849.
GENERAL NOTE:
This is the  follow-up 'choice' question asked 1984 and later of Rs
who replied to the full 7-point scale question (VCF0803) with 'Don't
know' or 'haven't thought much'; except for years 1984, 1986 and 1990
this question was also asked of Respondents who answered 'moderate.'
Using the initial 7-point scale (VCF0803) and this follow-up, a final
3-category summary was also constructed in these years: the final 3-
category summary is VCF0849.
If R's response to the 7-point scale question (VCF0803) was NA then
this follow-up question was not asked.
2000 NOTE:
This variable represents 7-point scale data from interviews conducted
using both modes; approximately half of the 2000 Study respondents (both
modes) were randomly selected for administration of a branching
series.  The latter respondents are excluded here.

Liberal-Conservative Position 1984- COLLAPSED

QUESTION:
---------
We hear a lot of talk these days about liberals and conservatives. I'm
going to show you [1996-LATER: Here is] a 7-point scale on which the
political views that people might hold are arranged from extremely
liberal to extremely conservative.  Where would you place yourself
on this scale, or haven't you thought much about this? (7-POINT SCALE
SHOWN TO R).
(IF R RESPONDS 'DON'T KNOW' OR 'HAVEN'T THOUGHT MUCH ABOUT THIS'In
1984 AND LATER; IF R RESPONDS 'MODERATE' IN 1988, 1992, 1996-LATER:)
If you had to choose, would you consider yourself a liberal or a
conservative?

VALID CODES:
------------
1. Liberal
3. Moderate ('middle of the road')
5. Conservative
6. Refuses to choose (in follow-up [exc. 1988 moderates]), don't know

MISSING CODES:

9. NA to entire question
0. NA to follow-up; R not administered 7pt scale series (2000); no 
   Post IW

NOTES:
------
See also VCF0803 and VCF0824.
GENERAL NOTE:
This is the final 3-cateogry summary for years 1984 and later,
constructed using the initial 7-point scale question (VCF0803) and the
follow-up 'choice' question (VCF0824), which was asked of respondents
who had replied 'don't know' or 'haven't thought much' to the 7-point
scale question and, except for years 1984, 1986, AND 1990, also asked
of respondents who had answered 'moderate'.
If R's response to the 7-point scale question was NA, then the follow-
up question ('if you had to choose...') was not asked and VCF0849 has
been coded 9.  If DK/HTM in first question and the response to the
follow-up was 'don't know,' VCF0849 has been coded 8.  If R refused to
choose in the follow-up, VCF0848 has been coded 7.
Code 1 is comprised of 'extremely liberal,' 'liberal,' and 'slightly
liberal' responses to the 7-point scale question (codes 1-3 in VCF0803)
and of 'liberal' responses to the follow-up.
Code 3 for 1984,1986,1990 is comprised of Rs who replied 'moderate' to
the 7-point scale question (code 4 in VCF0803, with the follow-up not
asked) and also of Rs who replied DK or 'haven't thought much' to the
7-point scale question and who then replied 'moderate' to the follow-up.
For 1988, 1992, 1996 and later, code 3 is comprised of: 1) cases where
R replied 'moderate' to the 7-point scale question and then refused to
choose another category or replied DK/NA to the follow-up; and 2) Rs
who replied DK or 'haven't thought much' to the 7-point scale question
and then replied 'moderate' in the follow-up.
Code 5 is comprised of 'extremely conservative,' conservative,' and
'slightly conservative' responses to the 7-point scale question (codes
5-7 in VCF0803) and of 'conservative' responses in the follow-up.
2000 NOTE:
This variable represents 7-point scale follow-up data from interviews
conducted using both modes; approximately half of the 2000 Study
respondents (both modes) were randomly selected for administration of a
branching series and are excluded here.

Mention 1: What is the Most Important National Problem

QUESTION:
---------
1960: 
What would you personally feel are the most important problems the
government should try to take care of when the new President and
Congress take office in January?
1964:
As you well know, there are many serious problems in this country and in
other parts of the world.  The question is, what should be done about
them and who should do it.  We want to ask you about problems you think
the government in Washington should do something about and any problems
it should stay out of.  First, what would you personally feel are the
most important problems the government should try to take care of when
the new President and Congress take office in January?
1966:
What do you personally feel are the most important problems which the
government in Washington should try to take care of?
1968,1980,1982:
As you well know, the government faces many serious problems in this
country and in other parts of the world.  What do you personally feel
are the most important problems which the government in Washington
should try to take care of?
1970:
As you well know, there are many serious problems in this country and in
other parts of the world.  We'd like to start out by talking with you
about some of them.  What do you personally feel are the most important
problems which the government in Washington should try to take care of?
1972-1978,1984 AND LATER:
What do you think are the most important problems facing this country?
(IF MORE THAN ONE PROBLEM:) Of all you've told me (1996-LATER: Of those
you've mentioned), what would you say is the single most important
problem the country faces?

NOTES:
------
See Appendix NOTE 'MOST IMPORTANT PROBLEM'.
GENERAL NOTE:
Because of changes in the full sets of codes which have been used over
time, this variable is limited to preserving the major groupings which
have been utilized with essential consistency through all years.  The
appendix NOTE gives exact study-by-study versions of the texts of
individual codes which have been collapsed to form the VCF0875 group
categories.
In the 1960, 1966, and 1970 study datasets, one multiple- response
variable was coded which included up to 3 mentions (1970: 4).  In 1960
and 1970, variables were coded in order of importance in cases where R
mentioned more than one problem. Within the study documentation for
these two years, it was also stated that, in cases of more than one
mentioned problem, if order of importance was 'not  clear,' responses
were then coded in order of mention.  From the 1966 documentation, it
is not apparent if multiple responses were coded in order of importance
or if they were coded in order of mention.  The first CODED response
(variable) in studies 1960, 1966, and 1970 has been used here.
In the 1964 and 1968 study datasets, one single-response variable
was coded.  This variable was described as including, in cases of more
than one given response, the mention considered most important by R.
Documentation in both years added that if order of importance was 'not
clear,' responses were coded in order of mention:  in such event, the
single variable appearing in the study dataset represented the first
mention.
Note that, for cases where R mentioned two or three problems but
missing data (DK or NA) appeared in the 'choice' variable (i.e., R did
not choose a single most important problem), the first mention has not
been included here, but MD has been coded. EXCEPTION: in 1986, in 142
cases the interviewer mistakenly did not ask R to rank problems by
importance when R gave more than one mention.  In these 142 cases, the
first mention of R has been incorporated.
In 1960, 1964 and 1966, the DK category was combined with 'no issues'
and is included in code 00.
1996 NOTE:
A half-sample of respondents were selected to be administered this
question.
2000 NOTE:
same as 1996.
2012 NOTE:
Not yet coded for the 2012 Time Series.

Congressional District of Residence

QUESTION:
---------
Congressional district of interview

VALID CODES:
------------
Codes1-53 Plus:

MISSING CODES:
--------------
99. District of Columbia
00. NA; wrong district identified
INAP. question not used

NOTES:
------
GENERAL NOTE:
Congressional district corresponds to the districting in effect during
the year of the interview, with the exception of California only for
1974: the redistricting occurring in California during 1974 was not
completed in time to be represented in the 1974 study.  District
numbers associated with 1974 California respondents are the district
numbers which were in effect in 1973.
Note that in some years several cases of corrections have been made to
states and/or Congressional districts due to inconsistencies or errors
in the STUDY data.
1992 NOTE 1:
For panel cases, this provides the congressional district of R's
original address (1990) rather than that of the address at which R was
residing in 1992.  Additionally, even if R did not move since 1990, the
redistricting which took place in many areas in 1992 may have changed
R'S district number in 1992.
1992 NOTE 2:
Late in 1994, it was discovered that in 50 cases an incorrect CD number
had been assigned.  These errors affect all questions related to House
race which are administered according to assigned-CD candidate names.
In the introduction to this codebook (p. iv) is a listing of 1992 (pre)
case IDs with correct congressional districts, however no data have
been changed in this file as a result.  Users of CDF data can delete
these cases from affected vars if desired.
1994 NOTE:
For panel cases who moved since their original, VCF0900 records the
congressional district where R was interviewed for the current Study.
The candidate list information also corresponds to the district where R
was residing during the current Study interview.
1996 NOTE:
same as 1994.
2000 NOTE:
3 cases were misidentified PA in the Preload but should have been NJ.
These cases are coded 00.
2002 NOTE:
Preload district assignment was incorrect in 1 case.

NOTES:

GENERAL NOTE:
This variable is available for 1970, 1974 and 1976 as well as 1978 and
later.  See warning NOTE below.  In some years this variable is not
available for no-post cases.
ANES samples are not designed to be representative at the Congressional
district level.  Samples include cases from only some U.S.
Congressional districts; for most congressional districts in which
interviewing actually takes place, only a small number of interviews
are taken.
Codes 40,41,45 and 49 apply as a result of redistricting: for other
Cumulative Data File variables referent to 'the incumbent' and 'the
challenger' the incumbent who represented R's sampling location BEFORE
redistricting has been considered R's 'incumbent' and the other
candidate (incumbent previously not representing R's sample location)
has been considered the 'challenger'; if two incumbents ran against
each other due to redistricting but neither had previously represented
R's location,  neither candidate has been treated as an 'incumbent'.
SEE 2012 NOTE FOR CHANGE IN 2012.
1970,1974,1976 WARNING NOTE:
In 1970, 1974 and 1976, no type of race var was present in the original
ANES datasets.  Data for these years have been added to VCF0902 by
implementing a case-by-case determination of type of race for every R's
congressional district through consultation of reference materials.
The resultant data in VCF0902 for these years have been checked
somewhat, but perfect accuracy cannot be guaranteed due to the nature
of attempting case-by-case coding.  The type of race established in
VCF0902 (and data in VCF0904-905 by derivation) for 1970, 1974 and 1976
should be used with caution and at the user's risk.
1978 NOTE:
1978 data in this variable do not exactly match the 1978 Study data:
several congressional districts in 1978 were not accurately coded for
for type of House race.  MS03 was coded as 14 in the original 1978 data
but should have been coded 12 (24 cases);  NY19 was coded as 12 in the
original 1978 data but should have been coded 14 (9 cases);  NY38 was
coded as 21 but should have been coded 24 (14 cases).  In VCF0902 these
cases have been corrected.  However,Note that in other Cumulative Data
File 900s-series congressional vars except for VCF0904, VCF0905 and
VCF1004-1014,  candidate-level data continue to accord with the
original 1978 study designated type of race for MS03, NY19 and NY38.
1984 NOTE:
1 case in TX22 and 1 case in WA01 were mistakenly coded 65 in the
Study dataset and have been corrected to 55 here. Also, 1 case in WI05
was mistakenly coded 13 and has been corrected to 14 here.  1 case in
OH08 and 1 case in WI09 were mistakenly coded 12 and have been
corrected to 21 here.  Finally, 4 cases in CA38 were incorrectly coded
(1 as 13, 3 as 21) and have been corrected to 12 here.  These changes
have been reflected in VCF1004 and VCF1005.
1992 NOTE 1:
For panel cases, this provides the type of race for the 1992
congressional district of R's original address (1990) rather than the
address to which R may have moved by the time of the 1992 interview(s).
1992 NOTE 2:
Late in 1994, it was discovered that in 50 cases an incorrect CD number
had been assigned.  These errors affect all questions related to House
race which were administered according to assigned-CD candidate names.
In the introduction to this codebook is a listing of case IDs with
correct districts, however no data have been changed in this file as a
result.  Users can delete these cases from affected vars if desired.
1994 NOTE:
Codes represent type of race in district of interview location for the
current Study year.
1996 NOTE 1:
same as 1994.
1996 NOTE 2:
14 Pre interviews were conducted before the status of the congressional
race in R's district assumed its final form.  These cases are flagged
in 1996 Study variable V960127, and the race type projected at the time
the Pre interview was administered is documented in 1996 Study variable
V960128. (In such cases Pre survey data are consistent with V960128.)
1998 NOTE:  
2 districts had the incorrect type of race identified, and the 1998 
instrument was administered according to the incorrect type of House 
race.  Cumulative Data File variables utilize 1998 data which have not 
had corrections made:  In 1998, cases in AL07 should have been type 
race 14 (instead of 24); cases in CA41 should have been type race 55 
(instead of 12).
2000 NOTE:  
3 cases were misidentified PA in the Preload but should have been NJ. 
These cases are coded 00.
2002 NOTE:
Code 55 includes 2 cases from LA05 where a Democratic and 2 Republican
candidates were running.
2004 NOTE:
The extent of the Texas redistricting prior to the 2004 election 
produced House races with incumbents running in areas where he or 
she had provided little or no prior representation, thus no Texas 
candidate has been identified as a true incumbent (running or 
retiring) for the new Texas districts (House type race 44-49).
2012 NOTE:
The extent of redistricting in 2012 prohibited singling out, at 
district level, one candidate who not only ran in 2012 to represent 
households within the boundaries of the new district which corresponded
to R's household location and who was also, prior to the redistricting, 
the U.S. House representative for households within the boundaries of 
the previous district that corresponded to R's household location 
(prior to redistricting). Overlap of new and old district was often 
very small. Incumbents in VCF0902-VCF0905, VCF0908 can only identify 
whether or not a candidate running for Congress in 2012 was in office
in Congress prior to the 2012 elections.
Note that VCF1014 (House winner) is coded at district level according
to type House race in VCF0902.
Louisiana district 3 is coded for House race type 45; a Democratic
challenging candidate also ran in the district.
2016 NOTE:
Final candidates for the U.S. House election in district LA04 were not
determined prior to post-election interviewing. LA04 cases are coded
99. For some 2016 cases, names of candidates were not preloaded either 
because date of interview preceded date when final candidates were 
determined or else due to preload issue. For the latter instances, any 
CDF questions related to candidates are NA.

Challenger to Running U.S. House Incumbent

QUESTION:
---------
How about [challenging candidate] who also ran for has been the U.S.
House of Representative from this district.
Have you come into  contact with or learned anything about (him/her)
through any of these ways?

VALID CODES:
------------
1. Yes
5. No, no contact at all

MISSING CODES:
--------------
9. NA; no Post IW; Washington D.C.; telephone IW (1984); short form 
   IW (1992)
0. Incumbent candidate unopposed or not running; challenger not in major 
   party
INAP. question not used

NOTES:
------
GENERAL NOTE:
Districts in which the respondent's U.S. House representative was not
running for re-election have been coded 0.
1984 NOTE:
if R was in a district where no incumbent was running or where the
incumbent was unopposed (or opposed by a non-major party challenger)
BUT the interview administered was a telephone IW, then VCF0919-926
have been coded 9, not 0.  If R was in a district where no incumbent
was running or where the incumbent was unopposed (or opposed by a non-
major party challenger) BUT the interview administered was an
abbreviated telephone IW, then VCF0927 has been coded 9, not 0.
1986 NOTE:
in the 1986 Study data, 8 major party challengers to the running U.S.
House incumbent were mistakenly excluded from challenger data (6
Republican challengers, 2 Democratic challengers). Contact data for
these individuals have been coded 9  (NA) in VCF0919-927 and VCF0947.

Contact with U.S. House Republican Cand

QUESTION:

Think of [Republican candidate] [who has been the U.S. Representative
from this district/ who ran for the U.S. House of Representatives from
this district].
Have you come into contact with or learned anything about (him/her)
through any of these ways?

VALID CODES:
------------
1. Yes
5. No

MISSING CODES:
--------------
9. NA; no Post IW; Washington D.C.; telephone IW (1984); short form IW 
   (1992)
0. No Republican candidate running
INAP. question not used

NOTES:
------
1984 NOTE:
If R was in a district where no Republican candidate was running BUT
the interview administered was a telephone IW, then VCF0928-935 have
been coded 9, not 0.  If R was in a district where no Republican
candidate was running BUT the interview administered was an abbreviated
telephone IW, then VCF0936 has been coded 9, not 0.
1986 NOTE:
In the 1986 Study dataset, 8 major party challengers to the running
U.S. House incumbent were mistakenly excluded from challenger data (SEE
VCF0919).  Six of the omitted challengers were Republican:  contact
data for them appear in code 9 (NA) in VCF0928- VCF0936 and VCF0948.

Correct Whether a U.S. House Candidate Was Already in Office

QUESTION:
---------
1958,1964,1966: 
Do you happen to know if (either/the) candidate is already in Congress?
(IF YES AND 2 MAJOR PARTY CANDIDATES IN DISTRICT:) Which {candidate} was
that?
1968:
Do you happen to know if (either one of these candidates/if he) is
already in Congress? (IF YES AND 2 MAJOR PARTY CANDIDATES IN DISTRICT:)
Which one?
1978 AND LATER:
Do you happen to know if [candidate in district where only 1 candidate
ran] / either [first candidate in district where 2 candidates ran] or
[second candidate in district where 2 candidates ran] was already in the
U.S. House of Representatives before the election?
(IF YES AND 2 MAJOR PARTY CANDIDATES IN DISTRICT:) Which {candidate} was
that?

VALID CODES:
------------
1. CORRECT:  correct incumbency status; correct candidate [districts w/incumbents 
   running with major party opposition]
2. INCORRECT:   incorrect incumbency status; incorrect candidate  [districts 
   w/incumbents running with major party opposition]

MISSING CODES:
--------------
9. DK if incumbent; DK which is incumbent; NA if incumbent; NA which is 
   incumbent; no major party candidate running; no Post IW; abbrev. 
   telephone IW (1984); Washington D.C.; short form (1992)
INAP. question not used

NOTES:
------
See VCF0977.
GENERAL NOTE:
If no incumbent was running in R's district and R replied 'yes' (1 or
2 major party candidates), then 2 has been coded.  If an incumbent was
running unopposed in R's district and R answered 'yes,' then 1 has
been coded.
If an incumbent was running with major party opposition in R's district
and R answered 'yes,' then R has been coded according to whether R
correctly identified WHICH candidate was the incumbent.
If R responded that 'both' candidates were incumbents but R did not
live in one of the districts where two 'incumbents' were actually
running (due to redistricting), then R's response has been considered
'incorrect'.  If, however, there actually were two 'incumbents' in R's
congressional district, then an answer of 'both' OR an answer of either
of the two incumbents' names has been considered 'correct'.
2000 DATA:
1 case where respondent's district was NA and 3 cases where respondent
district was misidentified have been coded 9.

Democratic U.S. House Cand: Respondent Likes - Number of Mentions

QUESTION:

Democratic candidate for the U.S. House of Representatives?

VALID CODES:
------------
0. Zero negative mentions (dislikes)
1. One negative mention (dislikes)
2. Two negative  mentions (dislikes)
3. Three negative mentions (dislikes)
4. Four or more negative mentions (dislikes)

MISSING CODES:

6. 'I don't know anything about this candidate' (Volunteered)
7. DK if liked anything about candidate; liked something about candidate 
   but DK what
8. No Democratic candidate in R's district (includes Washington D.C.)
9. NA if liked anything about candidate; liked something about candidate 
   but NA what; no Post IW; abbrev. telephone IW (1984); short form (1992); 
   district NA (2000); district misidentified (2000)
INAP. question not used

NOTES:
------
GENERAL NOTE:
Four possible mentions were coded in all original study datasets except
1988 and later, which coded 5.
Rs who responded 'no' to 'Is there anything in particular that you
liked about the US House Democratic candidate?' have been coded here
as 0 mentions.  'DK' responses to this question and 'I don't know
anything about this candidate' responses have been maintained as MD
codes, unlike VCF0401-402 and VCF0405-406, because of the very high
numbers of respondents falling into these categories [for consistency,
NA responses to this question have also been retained as MD].  In
addition, if R responded 'yes' to 'Is there anything in particular
that you liked about the US House Democratic candidate' but R provided
no mentions (DK or NA in first mention), then R has been coded in
the corresponding MD category in VCF0980.
In 1996 and later, randomization occurred for the order in which the
Democratic and Republican House candidate names were administered for
the set of 'likes/dislikes' questions.
1984 AND 1992 NOTE:
For 1984 and 1992:  if R was in a district where no Democratic
candidate was running BUT the interview administered was an
abbreviated telephone interview (1984) or a short form interview
(1992), then VCF0980 has been coded 9, not 8.
1998 NOTE:
1 case (0062) that was coded 'yes' in the 1998 study data as response
whether there was anything R liked about the Democratic House candidate
should have been coded 'I don't know anything about this candidate' but
has been correctly categorized in variables VCF0980 and VCF0981.

Republican U.S. House Cand: Respondent Likes - Number of Mentions

QUESTION:

Is/Was there anything in particular that you liked about [U.S. House
Republican candidate]? What is/was that? Anything else?

VALID CODES:
------------
0. Zero positive mentions (likes)
1. One positive mention (likes)
2. Two positive  mentions (likes)
3. Three positive mentions (likes)
4. Four or more positive mentions (likes)

MISSING CODES:
--------------
6. 'I don't know anything about this candidate' (Volunteered)
7. DK if liked anything about candidate; liked something about candidate 
   but DK what
8. No Republican candidate in R's district (includes Washington D.C.)
9. NA if liked anything about candidate; liked something about candidate 
   but NA what; no Post IW; abbrev. telephone IW (1984); short form 1992); 
   district NA (2000); district misidentified (2000)
INAP. question not used

NOTES:
------
GENERAL NOTE:
Four possible mentions were coded in all original study datasets except
1988 and later, which coded 5.
Rs who responded 'no' to 'Is there anything in particular that you
liked about the US House Republican candidate?' have been coded here
as 0 mentions.  'DK' responses to this question and 'I don't know
anything about this candidate' responses have been maintained as MD
codes, unlike VCF0401-402 and VCF0405-406, because of the very high
numbers of respondents falling into these categories [for consistency,
NA responses to this question have also been retained as MD].  In
addition, if R responded 'yes' to 'Is there anything in particular
that you liked about the US House Republican candidate' but R provided
no mentions (DK or NA in first mention), then R has been coded in
the corresponding MD category in VCF0980.
In 1996 and later, randomization occurred for the order in which the
Democratic and Republican House candidate names were administered for
the set of 'likes/dislikes' questions.
1984 AND 1992 NOTE:
For 1984 and 1992:  if R was in a district where no Republican
candidate was running BUT the interview administered was an
abbreviated telephone interview (1984) or a short form interview
(1992), then VCF0980 has been coded 9, not 8.
1998 NOTE:
1 case (0062) that was coded 'yes' in the 1998 study data as response
whether there was anything R liked about the Republican House candidate
should have been coded 'I don't know anything about this candidate' but
has been correctly categorized in variables VCF0980 and VCF0981.

INAP. question not used

NOTES:
------
GENERAL NOTE:
This variable has been created from R's party ID (VCF0301) and
from type of congressional race (VCF0902).  The respondent has
been considered a partisan if R was coded as 'strong' 'weak' or leaning.
WARNING:
In years prior to 1978, no 'type of race' var was present in study
datasets.  Data were added, however, to 'type of race' cumulative file
var 902 for 1970, 1974 and 1976 using a lengthy case-by-case
procedure.  Although the resultant 'type of race' data have been
checked to some extent, the possibility of some error must be
recognized:  the 'type of race' established for 1970, 1974 and 1976--
and, as a further result, data in VCF1004 and VCF1005 for 1970, 1974
and 1976 (which have been built using type-of-race data)-- should be
used with caution and at the user's risk.

32. Republican candidate in race without running incumbent
33. Democratic incumbent

    R says s/he does not remember any (or DK/NA if remembers any) names; 
    Washington D.C.; California (1974 only, due to redistricting type of 
    race could not be determined); no Post IW; short form (1992)
INAP. question not used

NOTES:
------
GENERAL NOTE:
In the original ANES datasets 1978 and later, the recall variables
which appeared had codes comparable to the codes appearing VCF1006-
VCF1008.  Prior to 1978, however, recall vars in ANES datasets were
coded quite differently, and translating pre-1978 recall data into
VCF1006-1008 data involves lengthy case-by-case consultation to
reference sources for type of race in R's congressional district.
Among pre-1978 studies, recall data have been incorporated for 1970 and
1974 only.  NO attempt has been made to include recall data from ANES
studies prior to 1970.
1970 AND 1974 NOTE:
every House candidate was assigned a unique candidate number.  Correct
names of candidates given by R in response to the recall question were
coded within 1970 Study data by that individual candidate  number.
Indications are that, if the name mentioned by the respondent was not
on a complete list of candidates and candidate numbers which existed
for R's STATE, then the response was simply coded as 'incorrect.'
However, it is not apparent that any attempt was made to ascertain
whether a name 'correctly' given was actually a correct name from the
congressional race in R's own district:  if R correctly named a
candidate from another-- or wrong-- district within the state, the
response was still included among 'correct' responses.  For VCF1006-
VCF1008, individual candidate numbers within the original 1970 recall
var have been examined on a case-by-case basis to determine if the
candidate number given by R corresponded to a name from the race in R's
own congressional district.  If so, the response has been included as a
recall.  If not, the response has been coded as no recall (99 MD).
This same procedure was followed for including 1974 data, although the
1974 study's method for handling individual candidate codes of names
outside R's district of residence was not specifically described in any
1974 study documentation.  Additional NOTE for 1970 and 1974:   to
create the specific candidate-type codes which appear in CDF VCF1006-
VCF1008, each correctly recalled name (once determined appropriate to
R's congressional district) was checked individually according to type
of race to determine the named candidate's exact status (e.g.,
Republican incumbent, etc.).
WARNING NOTE:
The procedures used in the creation of VCF1006-1008 for 1970 and 1974
produced data that have been checked somewhat, but perfect accuracy
cannot be completely guaranteed due to the nature of attempting case-by-
case correction. Data in VCF1006-1008 for 1970 and 1974 should be used
with caution and at the user's risk.

   House race; DK/NA who voted for; R has no major party partisanship; R 
   voted for candidate whose name was not on candidate list (1978-1988) 
   or for third party candidate(all years); no Post IW
INAP. question not used

NOTES:
------
GENERAL NOTE:
The respondent has been considered a partisan if R was 'strong', 'weak'
or 'leaning'.
In 1978 and later, R selected name from ballot card.  When R gave a
name not on the candidate list, MD was coded, and party of vote was
undetermined.
In 1970-1976, every House candidate was assigned a unique candidate
number.  Rs who reported their House vote were coded into two
variables, the first of which recorded the candidate number of the
named candidate, if the name was correctly given.  If the name
mentioned by the respondent was not on the complete list of candidates
and candidate numbers, then the response was simply coded as
'incorrect.'  The respondent was then asked for the party of the
candidate which s/he named.  VCF1011-1013 WERE BUILT FOR 1970-1976
USING THE SECOND, OR 'PARTY OF VOTE,' VARIABLE (even in cases where the
party given by R was not appropriate for a correctly rendered candidate
name).  [ NOTE:  if name given in 1970-1976 was 'incorrect' or DK/NA,
'party of vote' variable was still used unless missing data:  if 'party
of vote' was missing data and name was 'incorrect' or DK/NA, vote in
VCF1011-1013 has been coded 9.] Note that VCF0707, VCF0736 vote vars
were also created from this 'party of vote' variable for 1970-1976, but
the vote data present in VCF1011-1013 differ slightly from that in
VCF0707 and VCF0736 in 1970-1976 for the following cases:  if R
correctly gave the name of a candidate who was on the complete list of
candidates and candidate numbers BUT did not provide any party
designation (DK or NA) in the followup 'party of vote' var, then the
party of the candidate correctly named in the first recall (name) var
was ascertained and incorporated into VCF1011-1013.  This procedure was
not undertaken for 1970-1976 in vars VCF0707 and VCF0736, which retain
these cases as missing data.
Note that, because no ballot card was used, for 1968-1976 the party
for which R claimed to have voted in the House election is represented
in VCF1011-1013 even for so-called 'impossible' cases:  e.g., when R
declares R voted for a Democrat when R lives in a Congressional
district in which only a Republican incumbent ran in the House
election: in such a case, VCF1011-1013 are coded as if R did indeed
vote for a Democrat.
1968 NOTE:
R's response to the House vote question was coded into a single summary
variable which provided categories to establish whether R provided a
correct or incorrect Democratic House candidate name, a correct or
incorrect Republican House candidate name, a party mention only, or a
minor party/write-in/unidentifiable candidate name.  This 1968 variable
was accompanied by the following NOTE:  'When R's mention of candidate
name and party were inconsistent, the response was coded as if party
were the dominant element.  Example:  R mentioned 'Burke, a Democrat'
but Burke was a Republican.  Response was coded 'incorrect Republican
candidate.'' For VCF1011-1013, party of R's 1968 House vote was taken
from this variable.

1. R's Vote: for incumbent candidate in race involving running incumbent
2. R's Vote: for candidate other than incumbent in race involving running 
             incumbent (1970-1988:  incl. 3rd party/ind. candidates)

MISSING CODES:

   House race; DK/NA who voted for; no incumbent running in congressional 
   district; R voted for name not on candidate list (1978-1990); R voted 
   for third party/ independent candidate who is not an incumbent (1990 and 
   later); R voted out of district, NA if incumbent (91,92 in VCF0735); 
   Washington D.C.; no Post IW; California (1974 only, due to redistricting 
   type of race could not be determined)
INAP. question not used

NOTES:
------
See VCF1011.
GENERAL NOTE:
Beginning in 1990 Study data,  third party and independent candidates
were combined with unknown names coded in 'name not on candidate list'
(code 97) whenever the non-major party candidate was not on the
Candidate List; only independent or 3rd party candidates who were on
the Candidate List were given a separate code (code 30).
In 1970-1988, independent or 3rd party candidates could be coded
distinct from 'name not on candidate list' even if their name was
NOT on the Candidate List.  For 1970-1988, if R voted for a third
party or independent candidate who was not the incumbent, then
VCF1012 has been coded 2 even if the candidate's name was not on the
Candidate List.
WARNING NOTE:
In years prior to 1978, no 'type of race' var was present in Study
data.  Data were added, however, to 'type of race' VCF0902 for 1970,
1974 and 1976 using a lengthy case-by-case procedure.  Although the
resultant 'type of race' data have been checked to some extent, the
possibility of some error must be recognized:  the 'type of race'
established for 1970, 1974 and 1976-- and, as a further result, data in
VCF1012 for 1970, 1974 and 1976-- should be used with caution and at
the user's risk.

Respondent Vote for Winning U.S. House Candidate in district of IW

QUESTION:
---------
Did R vote for winner?

VALID CODES:
------------
1. R's Vote: for winner
2. R's Vote: for candidate other than the winner (incl. names not on candidate 
             list)

MISSING CODES:
--------------
9. R did not vote or DK/NA if voted; R voted but not (or DK/NA if) in 
   House race; DK/NA who voted for; Washington D.C.; no Post IW; R voted
   outside his/her district of interview (1978-later only, not determinable 
   prior to 1978)
INAP. question not used

NOTES:
------
GENERAL NOTE:
Built using VCF1014 (except 1974).
See NOTEs VCF1011 describing process which establishes who R voted
for. NOTE the following exception for 1974 California cases:  Rs who
gave the party of their vote BUT who gave an 'incorrect' [or DK/NA]
name could not be traced to their congressional district number which
was in effect after the 1974 redistricting in CA, so that party of
winning candidate was unknown:  all such cases have been coded 2 here
[25 cases].
1974 NOTE:
The winners in the 1974 California House congressional races which were
mistakenly overlooked in the 1974 Study release have been restored
here.  ( NOTE, however, that 1974 California data for VCF1014 'Who Won'
is not recoverable.)
WARNING NOTE:
The procedures used in the creation of the VCF1014 'winner'
var produced data that have been checked somewhat, but perfect
accuracy cannot be completely guaranteed due to the nature of
attempting coding from reference material.  The possibility of some
error must be recognized and the 'winner' established in VCF1014
--and, as a further result, data in VCF1013 (which has been built
using 'winner' data) -- should be used with caution and at the user's
risk.

NOTES:
------
1970 NOTE:
Warning: The procedures used in the creation of the VCF1014 'winner' 
for 1970 and 1974 produced data that have been checked somewhat, but  
perfect accuracy cannot be completely guaranteed due to the nature of
attempting case- by-case  coding from reference material.  The
possibility of some error must be  recognized and the 'winner'
established in VCF1014 should be used with caution and at the user's
risk.
1974 NOTE:
See 1970 warning.
California data in 1974 for VCF1014 'Who Won' is not recoverable
because 'type of race' in California districts for the 1974 election
cannot be determined.
2016 NOTE:

How long have you lived here in (1986 AND LATER: your present) (1984:

VALID CODES:
------------
0. 1 Year or less (2002,2004: less than 1 year)
1. 13-23 Mos. (1988-1992 only) (2002,2004: 12-18 months)

MISSING CODES:

NOTES:
------
GENERAL NOTE:
In Pre-Post study years, this was a pre var.
In 1968-1978, if number of years given included a fraction of 6 or
more months, then the number of years coded was rounded up to the next
highest whole number.   In 1980-1986, this practice was restricted to
instances where the total number of years (and months) given was less
than 2 years; if the number of years given was greater than 2, then
any fraction was dropped.
In 1988-1990, all fractions of years were dropped with the exception
of months less than a year (coded as 1 year, code 0), and 13-23 months
(code 1). In 1994 and later, all fractions of years were dropped with
the exception of months less than a year (coded 0); the code '13-23
months; 2 years' has been recoded to 2.
Beginning in 2012, exact number of years was not in the public release.
1974 NOTE:
Code 'all of life' was not used.
2002 NOTE:
This question was asked only of Fresh Cross respondents.
2004 NOTE:
Code 76 includes, '76 years or more.'  Code, 'All of life'
was not used.

Although a category appeared for 'no preference' in 1968, R was not
asked the filter question, 'Did you prefer one of the candidates for
president?' and the absence of this filter was reflected in the small
1968 'no preference' N (presumably volunteered responses). In 1980,
1984, 1988 and 1992 Rs who replied 'no' to the filter question were
coded 7 here.

One case from dual 'nonvoter, NA preference; voted but not for
president' has been coded 9 here.
1968 NOTE:
One case originally coded 'Nixon or Wallace' has been coded 9 here.

NOTES:
------
See Appendix NOTE 'STATES AND PARTIES OF ELECTIONS/CANDIDATES'.
GENERAL NOTE:
Ballot card was not used until 1978.  In 1978-1982, 1986 R selected
name from ballot card.  When R gave a name not on the candidate list,
MD was coded, and party of vote was undetermined.
In 1952, 1958, 1964-1968 (no ballot card), when an incorrect name--
i.e., not on the candidate list--was given with a party association,
the party given was coded.  When a correct name was given with an
incorrect party, then the actual party associated with the named
candidate was coded: 'Smith, a Democrat' was coded as a Republican if,
in fact  (contrary to R's perception) Smith was indeed a Republican.
In 1970-1976 (no ballot card), R's perception of candidate's party was
given.  If an incorrect name (not on the candidate list) was given,
party associated was still coded.  If a given party was not the actual
party of a correctly named candidate, party as given was still coded.
In 1952, 1958, 1960 and 1964, this question was coded as a multiple
response variable allowing, when applicable, for candidate-at-large
mentions (2nd response) as well as district choice of candidates (1st
response).  Second responses were excluded in coding VCF9025.
If R did not vote AND R's state did not have a gubernatorial race,
then 0 (not 9) has been coded.
In 1980, 1982, 1986, 1990:  if there was no race in state of IW BUT it
was determined that R voted outside of state of IW AND R designated
his/her vote for governor in the other state, then this variable has
been coded for the party of R's 'outside' vote, not coded 0 MD (no
race in state).  Before 1980, it was not determined whether R voted
outside of state of IW, and no information was previously available
for any votes for governor outside of state of IW.
2016 NOTE:
In 2016, state of vote was determined for voters who voted outside
state of residence; this variable represents vote in state of vote.

 1980:
 Your state held a primary election on [date].  Did you vote in that
 election, or were you unable to do so?  (IF VOTED:) Did you vote in the
 Republican primary or the Democratic primary? (SEE NOTE FOR ARKANSAS,
 SOUTH CAROLINA, MISSISSIPPI)
 1988:
 This state held a presidential primary/caucus election in [month].  In
 talking to people about elections, we find that a lot of people were not
 able to vote because they weren't registered, they didn't meet party
 qualifications, they were sick or just didn't have the time.  How about
 you--did you vote in that primary election/ caucus?  (IF YES:) Did you
 vote in the Republican or the Democratic primary/caucus?
 1992:
 This state held a Presidential (primary/caucus) election in [month].  In
 talking to people about elections, we find that many people did not vote
 for a variety of reasons.  How about you--did you vote in that primary
 (election/caucus)?  (IF YES:) Did you vote in the Republican or

NOTES:

GENERAL NOTE:
See Appendix NOTE 'STATES AND PARTIES OF ELECTIONS/CANDIDATES'.
1972 NOTE 1:
'Caucus' was not specified.
1972 NOTE 2:
This question was only asked of Rs who said they were registered
(eligible) to vote; if NA whether registered/ eligible or R didn't know
if R was registered/eligible, then R was not asked this question.
Additionally, in 1976, R was first asked the question whether R
recalled if R's state had a primary during the spring/summer of the
study year:  if R did recall whether there was a primary AND if R's
state did indeed have a primary, then this question was asked.

1980 NOTE 2:
votes in nonmajor party primaries were not accounted for (no code 5).
1980 NOTE 3:
Several states had only one primary for one major party.  In 1980
Arkansas held a Democratic primary; South Carolina held a Republican
primary; and Mississippi held a Republican primary.  If R indicated
that R voted in the party's primary that year, then R was coded here
for the party of the primary held.  The question asked in Arkansas,
South and Carolina and Mississippi in 1980 was: Your state held a
primary election on [date].  As you may know, the [Democratic/
Republican] party did not have a primary contest in [state] this year,
so there was only a [Democratic/Republican] primary election. Did you
vote in that election or were you unable  to do so?
1988 NOTE 1:
All states represented in the time series study had a primary or
caucus.  However, in some states (Kansas, Michigan and Wyoming
Democratic and Republican caucuses were held on separate dates and the
lead-in question was modified accordingly.

   before (1968)
0. R did not vote in previous election; R has never voted
INAP. question not used

NOTES:
------
GENERAL NOTE:
This question refers to the Presidential election preceding the current
year.
In 1952-1960,1964-1972,1976,1980, if R answered the filter, 'In the
elections for president since you have been old enough to vote, would
you say that you have voted in all of them, most of them, some of them,
or none of them?' with 'none of them' or answered that s/he was never
before able to vote because s/he was previously not a citizen or old
enough, then this question was not asked.
In 1956, 1960, 1976 and 1980, if it was NA whether R had ever voted,
then this question was not asked.  In 1968, if R DK whether R had ever
voted, then this question was not asked.
In 1962, 1982, 1988, 1990 and 1992 no filter was used, but Rs who did
not vote in the previous presidential election because of age or
citizenship ineligibility (or for any other reason) were simply coded
'did not vote'.
In 1956, 1958, 1960, and 1964 the study  documentation stated that
residents of Washington D.C. were INAP; however, in the data, it
some Washington D.C. residents were INAP while others were not.
1952 NOTE 1:
Code 9 contains 9 cases of respondents who replied that they 'thought'
they had voted Democratic in 1948 and 3 cases of respondents who
replied that they 'thought' they had voted Republican in 1948.
1952 NOTE 2:
In the original 1952 dataset, 1948 presidential votes for two
specified nonmajor party candidates were individually coded, and there
also appeared a combination category labeled 'other or NA or DK who'
(9 cases).  Rs who said they had voted for the specified nonmajor
party candidates in 1948 have been coded 5 here, while Rs from the
combination category of the original 1952 dataset have been coded 3
here.
1956 NOTE:
All cases (unknown number) of Rs who only 'thought' they voted for any
particular candidate in 1952 were combined with other missing data:
these cases are coded 9 here.

NOTES:
------
1974 NOTE:
1974 data are not coded comparably.
1978 NOTE:
NA in code 9 also includes 'NA name, DK party.'
1992 NOTE:
In California in 1992, in addition to the regular Senate election a
second 'special' Senate election was held and 4 --rather than 3 --
Senate recall mentions were coded for CA only in the original data.
For 1992 CA cases, CDF vars VCF9064-9066 are coded only for mentions
which are not mentions of 'special' election candidates (not candidate
'93' nor '94' in the original study data).  If a 1992 California
respondent has recall but R's ONLY mention(s) refer to the special
election candidates, then 8 has been coded in VCF9064-9066 [98 in
VCF9067].

Election Office Number

QUESTION:
---------
VOTE VALIDATION STUDY: Election Office Number

VALID CODES:
------------
3-DigitNumber 1-182 Coded,  Except:

MISSING CODES:
--------------
998. R self-report registered outside of area, attempt made by phone to 
     elicit registration and vote information from outside area election
     office (1984,1990 only)
000. Records not checked (1984,1986 only)
INAP. question not used

NOTES:
------
GENERAL NOTE:
Vars VCF9149-9155 are variables related to special Vote Validation
studies which have been conducted for some years of the ANES time
series. Vote validation studies were conducted in 1964, 1976, 1978,
1980, 1984, 1986, 1988, and 1990.  Information available in the
Study data across these years varies in completeness and coding; for
some of these years the Study data do not provide information (or
sufficient information) to code some variables VCF9149-9155.
This is the jurisdiction, county or municipality in which
registration and voting records are located for persons living in the
particular sample segment in which R was living when interviewed.
In 1988 and 1990 only, if records were not checked for R, the vote
validation office number which would have been assigned to R if
his/her records had been checked was coded.
In 1984 and 1990 only, if R reported that s/he was registered outside
of the sample area, telephone contact with the outside  election
office was made to attempt to elicit registration and vote information
about R.  In 1986 and 1988, no such attempt was made, and Rs who self-
reported their registration outside the sample area were not included
in vote validation checks for those years.
Note that in 1986 1 case coded 87 and 2 cases coded 152 in the
original office number variable (VCF0772) should have been MD (records
not checked/ registered out of area); they are corrected here (000).
For a description of cases in code 000 SEE VCF9152 (codes 2-7).

7. No: Office refuses all access to registration records

MISSING CODES:
--------------
0. 1976 non-Panel Rs
INAP. question not used

NOTES:
------
See NOTE VCF9149.
GENERAL NOTE:
Code 1:   For 1984 and 1990, code 1 includes telephone attempts at
validation of cases registered outside of sample  area (998 in
VCF9149). Similar attempts were not made in  other years. For 1980,
code 1 includes 31 cases (code 9 in original var 1207) where respondent
was discovered to be registered at a different address: NOTE, however,
that for these cases no effort was subsequently made to
Code 2:   Applies to 1984-1990 only.  In 1984-1990, vote validation
was intended for Rs who: 1) reported that they voted;  or 2) reported
that they didn't vote but were registered; or 3) had no post IW.
That is, in years 1984-1990, POST RS WHO DID NOT REPORT THAT THEY WERE
REGISTERED WERE NOT VALIDATED.
Codes 3-7: All years:  complications in the ability to carry out
registration records-checks prevented the validation of registration
status for some Rs for whom validation was originally intended.
Validation was intended in 1984-90 for all Rs except nonvoters who
didn't report being  registered.  Prior to 1984, vote validation was
intended for all ANES respondents [exception:  alidation was not
intended for 1964 no-posts (code 5).  Validation was not intended for
1976 no-posts, however ANES was able to carry out validation for some
1976 no-posts.]
Code 4:  although registration status was not checked (assumed
unnecessary), voting records WERE checked (for 1980, 1 in VCF9153).
1986 NOTE:
4 cases for which validation was not attempted (due to insufficient
address, no name, or registered out of area) were mistakenly coded
'attempted.'  They are corrected in VCF9152 (code 3) and in VCF9154-
9155 (code 0).
1976 NOTE:
Only 1976 time-series respondents who also participated in the 1972-
1974-1976 panel study (ICPSR 7607) were included in 1976 vote
validation.  In vars 9151,9152,9154,9155, 1976 prepost Rs who did not
also participate in the panel study are INAP.

Status of Office Voting Records

QUESTION:
---------
VOTE VALIDATION STUDY: Status of Office Voting Records

VALID CODES:
------------
1. Office records appear to be adequate, no information about deficiencies
2. Some office voting records not accessible*
3. R's name unknown and/or insufficient address and/or registered out of area** 
     (not 1984,1986: see code 0)
5. No office voting records accessible***

MISSING CODES:
--------------
8. DK (1980:  0,9 in orig. dataset var 1207: 27 cases office error [5 in 
   VCF9152] and 31 cases registered at different address [see note VCF9152]; 
   1976: 5 in VCF9152, records not sent to field)
9. Office refused (7 in VCF9152)
0. Office not identified (0 in VCF9149: 1984,1986 only); 1976 non-Panel Rs
INAP. question not used

NOTES:
------
See NOTE VCF9149,VCF9152.
GENERAL NOTE:
This variable basically describes conditions at the records office
identified in VCF9149:
A- If R's election office was identified in VCF9149 then VCF9153 has
been coded-- regardless whether R was validated or not
applies specifically to 1988,1990).
B- In 1984 and 1986, R's records office was not identified if R
was unvalidated (0 in VCF9149): 1984 and 1986 unvalidated Rs
appear in MD code 0.
C- Records offices were not identified at all prior to 1984,
however some (limited) information about cases of inaccessibility
of voting records was obtained during 1980, 1978 and 1976.  NOTE
that all 1976-1980 cases have been coded 1 except for such
exceptions (described below and coded 5) and for name/address
problems (code 3).
In 1978 and 1976, identification of records office (VCF9149) was not
established, and minimal information about condition/accessibility of
office records was collected.  Information available from 1978  is
that in 32 cases (8 in original var 1409) of Rs with active
registration (coded 1 in VCF9152), interviewers were unable to check
voting records at all:  these cases have been coded 5 in VCF9153.
Similarly, information available from 1976 indicates that in 31 cases
of Rs (weighted:  code 8 in original var 5012) with active
registration status (coded 1 in VCF9152), interviewers were unable to
check vote records:  these cases have also been coded 5 in VCF9153.
No cases in VCF9153 are coded 2 for 1978 or 1976.
Code 1:   1984:  includes 40 cases which were coded 67, 68, or 998 in
VCF9149 (election office) and which were labeled 'problem with
registration records' in the original dataset's variable (V1129).
For all but 11 of these 40 cases, however, a voting record was found,
and, of the 11 for whom no voting record was subsequently found, 7 were
cases of telephone (limited) attempt at validation.
Code 3:   Except for 1984 and 1986, code 3 encompasses situations in
which it was impossible to check specifically for R's records.
Information identical to code 3 for 1984 and 1986 is found in
VCF9152 code 3.
Code 5:   1984:  No cases appear in code 5 for 1984, because the
original dataset variable combined cases of voting records 'wholly OR
partially unavailable' into a single code category (contained here in
code 2).
CODE ANNOTATION:
*   1988:  election offices 65,75,80,81,89,90,110,111
*   1986:  election offices 3,17,37-39,50,75,111,125,145,156.
*   1984:  election offices 61,65,76,79,82
**  1990:  9 in orig. dataset var V2003
**  1988:  2,9 in orig. dataset var V1143.
*** 1990:  election office 182
*** 1988:  code 1 in orig. dataset var 1145 [all cases, election
           office 76]
*** 1986:  election offices 68,69,79 and 1 case election office
           169 (3 other cases in 169 coded 1 in VCF9153 in
           accordance with original dataset)
*** 1976-1980:  see above
1980 NOTE:
Identification of records office (VCF9149) was not established, and
minimal information about condition/accessibility of office records was
collected.  Information available is that in 1980 in Montgomery County
Alabama, Madison County Alabama, and  Acadia Parish Lousiana, the
electoral offices would not allow any voting records to be accessible
(20 cases, 5 in VCF9153)-- although the office had already allowed
verification of registration status (coded 1 in VCF9152).  There are no
cases in code 2 for 1980.

NOTES:
------
See NOTE VCF9149,VCF9152.
GENERAL NOTE:
NOTE that information describing status [code 2] of non-active files
was not collected systematically before 1984.  Non-active-
registration  cases prior to 1984 appear in either code 1 or code 5,
with the following exceptions:  in 1978, original var 1408 indicated
whether registration records were eligible/active on election day (or
ineligible/inactive); 53 cases of inactive registration in 1978 have
been coded 2.  Similarly, in 1976,  original var 5003 indicated a
registration record but inactive for 70 cases, who have been coded 2
in VCF9154.

QUESTION:

VOTE VALIDATION STUDY: Was R Vote Validated

VALID CODES:
------------
1.  Yes
3.  Registration record was found, no record of R voting
5.  No registration record found; no record of voting 
    found

MISSING CODES:
--------------
0.  3,7 in VCF9152 (all years); 2 in VCF9152 (1984
    1990 only); 5 in VCF9152 (1964,1976); 5 in VCF9152 or
    8 in VCF9153 (1980 only)
9.  1976 non-Panel Rs
INAP. Inap. question not used

NOTES:
------
GENERAL NOTE:
See note VCF9149,VCF9152.
Code 3 and code 5 include cases of limited access to vote records 
(codes 2 and 5 in VCF9153).  Codes 3 and 5 also incorporate 1984 and 
1990 cases of attempted validation by phone of Rs registered out of 
area (998 in VCF9149).
In cases where registration is not required or where voting and
registration lists are for some reason kept entirely separate, this
code implies that an independent check for voting was also done and no
record of R voting was found.
In all Pre-Post years except 1964 (and some cases in 1976), this
variable includes in valid codes respondents who did not give a post-
election interview.
1964 and 1980 are the only years with cases categorized for same-day
registration.  Registration was not 'checked' in such cases but voting
records WERE checked (4 in VCF9152 and [1980] 1 in VCF9153).  The
results of the vote record checks for "same-day registration" Rs in
1964 and 1980 are represented here in codes 1 (voted) and 3 (did not
vote), with nocases of same-day registration coded 5.
1976 NOTE;
Only 1976 time-series respondents who also participated in the 1972-
1974-1976 panel study (ICPSR 7607) were included in 1976 vote
validation.  In vars VCF9151,9152,9154,9155, 1976 prepost Rs who did

Would R call self a born-again Christian /consider self a born-again Christian / had the deep religious experience described as being born again

QUESTION:
---------
1980,1984: 
Some people have had deep religious experiences which have 
transformed their lives.  I'm thinking of experiences sometimes 
described as "being born again in one's life."
There are deeply religious people who have not had an
experience of this sort.  How about you; have you had such an 
experience?
1988:
Do you consider yourself a born-again Christian?
1990,1992,1996-2000,2008:
Would you call yourself a born-again Christian, that is, 
have you personally had a conversion experience related to 
Jesus Christ?

that you think almost all of the people in that group tend
to be "hard-working."  A score of 7 means that almost all of
the people in the group are "lazy."  A score of 4 means that

one end or the other, and of course you may choose any
number in between.
